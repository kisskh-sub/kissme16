Yuwen Que.

Yuwen Que.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.030
No. It's too dangerous.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.110
You shouldn't have come.

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:35.269
Go. Now.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.869
What's between us

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.830
is not for you to judge.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:47.830
Never thought the Crown Prince of Mobei

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.470
would end up like this.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.830
Why are your hands so cold?

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.870
Was it worth it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.230
for me?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.349
Hurry!

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.509
Search over there!

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.069
It's too dangerous.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.669
Go!

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.190
Someone's coming.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.150
Since I've found you,

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.470
I won't let anyone take you away.

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.270
that person is your imperial father?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.229
Yuwen Que,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.949
do you know

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.150
what's the most ridiculous thing
in this world?

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.109
Everyone keeps deciding for me,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.261
yet no one ever asks what I want.

How are you?

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.310
Qingru.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.109
Qingru.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.829
What nonsense are you talking about now?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.550
The boat courtesan.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.550
Protect the boat courtesan.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.710
Qingru's mother.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.069
What did you say?

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm sorry.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.949
I failed to save her.

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.710
So,

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.349
all these years,

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.629
I blamed the one person
who tried to save my mother.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.629
Qingru.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.629
I'm sorry.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.109
I...

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.269
Enough.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:24.670
What do you have to apologize for?

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.149
I'm the one who should say sorry.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.069
Qingru.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.670
You shouldn't cry.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.550
Who's crying?

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.069
You'd better stay alive.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.110
We'll clear up
our misunderstandings slowly.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.750
We'll be trapped here tonight.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:47.069
You'd better stay strong.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350
Don't die in my arms.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:51.949
If like this,

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.069
I could die without regret.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.670
Yuwen Que.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.750
I won't allow you to die.

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:59.670
If you die,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.589
who will I take revenge on?

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.388
I still...

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.269
I still...

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.069
Yuwen Que.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.509
Yuwen Que.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.550
Yuwen Que.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.429
This...

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.948
This...

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.149
Young master, this is...

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.308
One best room.

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.429
The quietest one.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.349
Alright, this way.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.509
This way.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.870
This is it.

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.350
This wound...

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.629
He's been poisoned by the deadly
Turning Rain Swallow.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.269
How do you know?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.629
Ten years ago,
my son died from this poison.

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.269
But he should still be saved.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:12.589
Speak.

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:15.550
Thirty li from here lies
a Medicine Valley.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.509
Within it is a supreme antidote called
the Nine-Tailed Lotus.

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.910
Medicine Valley?
Why have I never heard of it?

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:27.870
Most people who go to that valley
never come back.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.949
The master of the Medicine Valley
is the Medicine Valley Immortal.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.629
The Medicine Valley Immortal?

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.029
Yes.

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.110
I met him once 30 years ago.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.029
He looked exactly the same
as he does now.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.310
Please, tell me more.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.388
It's said the Immortal
is over 90 years old,

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.709
yet his face remains that of a child.

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.188
The valley is filled
with rare medicinal herbs,

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:54.310
and he

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:57.469
is especially skilled
in preserving youth.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.469
Over 90 years old.

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.629
Young lady, do you know why he
lives alone in the Medicine Valley?

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:06.550
He is waiting for someone.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.310
Someone who can unravel
the mystery of the valley.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:10.549
Then I want to see

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.110
how mysterious this Medicine Valley
truly is.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:14.870
You must not go.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.469
You have no right to say that now.

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:24.469
It's too dangerous.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.629
Show me the route.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:27.880
Leave the city heading west.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.680
When you reach a cliff
and see an ancient pine,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.880
that will be the valley entrance.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.909
But young lady,
you must be very careful.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.230
That Immortal is unpredictable.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.948
Before meeting anyone,
he always tests them three times.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.308
Then I shall see

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.709
exactly who the Immortal is waiting for.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.230
Take good care of him.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.149
Slow down.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.870
Are you a guest from Cangzhou?

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:12.910
Then let me ask,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.308
how did you know?

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:17.310
The jade you carry
bears the aura of Cangzhou.

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.069
It's been 50 years.

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:21.269
At last, I've waited for a clever one.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:23.629
Is that so?

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.789
What makes me special?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.989
What do you think?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.148
What kind of person inspires a dying man

00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:32.750
to willingly take a blade for her?

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:35.069
To save that man,

00:08:35.189 --> 00:08:36.589
you must pass three trials.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.110
You really know how to test people.

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:41.709
(Ordinary petals)

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.949
(cannot harm anyone.)

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.748
(But among countless petals,)

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:47.628
(hides one red Spider Lily
that can take a life.)

00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:49.589
(Find that Spider Lily,)

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.869
(and you pass.)

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.148
(But if you choose wrongly,)

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:54.748
(then your soul shall depart in regret.)

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:55.829
Begin.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.829
(Do you know)

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.109
(that 20 years ago,)

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.388
(a woman very much like you
once came here?)

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:01.510
A woman?

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.829
(Unfortunately,
she never found the Spider Lily.)

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.229
(I wonder if you'll repeat her fate.)

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.309
(Time limit is one incense stick.)

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.150
(Choose wrong, and you die.)

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:13.829
Begin.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:16.550
(Interesting.)

00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:19.670
(Your eyes are exactly like hers.)

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.069
Her?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.229
(The woman who came
seeking the Nine-Tailed Lotus)

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.469
(to save her husband.)

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.069
(It's a pity,
she was too focused on saving him)

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:32.510
(and overlooked what mattered most.)

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.469
Found it.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.030
Why this one?

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.430
Everyone is searching
for the red Spider Lily,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.829
yet they don't realize

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.148
the deadliest poison

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:49.589
is often hidden
beneath the most ordinary surface.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.630
Interesting.
As expected of her daughter.

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:01.189
The woman you mentioned earlier...

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.748
You resemble her,

00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:04.309
but not entirely.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.109
She trusted people too easily,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.508
while your heart is filled
with hidden blades.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.229
You seem to know me well.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.030
The second trial has arrived.

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:16.030
There is a White Jade Butterfly
in that forest.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.709
Find it, and you will learn
all that you seek.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.790
What's the condition?

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:22.309
No condition.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.829
Only this forest.

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:27.630
It will show you the past
you least wish to face.

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:29.709
Are you ready?

00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:31.030
I'm already here.

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:32.469
I will not retreat.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.430
I hope you can endure it.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.748
This forest

00:10:37.749 --> 00:10:39.949
reflects the deepest secrets
of one's heart.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.109
Good luck.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:51.550
(Found you.)

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:52.869
(So this is where you were.)

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:55.270
(I must catch
this White Jade Butterfly.)
