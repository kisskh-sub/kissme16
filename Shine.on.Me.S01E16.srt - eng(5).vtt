you're back.

You should've just started without me.

in the microwave

since you got your year-end bonus,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.740
can we go on a trip somewhere?

I've been checking the group chat

I'm dying to go
to Changbai Mountain myself.

They say the skiing there is amazing,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.960

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.579
We should take a trip somewhere.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.700
But Changbai Mountain...

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.620
Mom's always hated the heat.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.120
She gets chest tightness
whenever it's too warm.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.579
But she handles the cold just fine.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.140
Remember Mom saying how much

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.240
she wanted to see the snow

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.360
in the North?

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.880
It's just that we rarely get
heavy snow in Nanjing.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.120
I'll

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.600
check with Mom and see what she thinks.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.100

Unbelievable.

Thailand's nice and warm.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.000

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.760
Stick around Suzhou for a few days.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.700
I'll cover everything.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.260
I don't think she can stay, though.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.920
Excuse me, coming through.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.540
Overnight trips

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.040
are a no-go for her.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.460
Once everyone's here,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.720
I'll introduce you guys.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.740
Nianyuan is a total mystery heiress

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.240
from Wuxi.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.780
I'd love to meet her.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.260
Luo Ke, watch your back!

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.160
Are you okay?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.360
Hey! Watch where you're going!

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.360
Are you blind or what?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.500
I... no...

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.680
There's a hole
in the back of your jacket.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.460
What?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.760
Oh, Heavens.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.600
I waited a whole month for this

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.340
to ship from overseas!

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.440
It's the first time I've even worn it!

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.680
I'm sorry,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.300
but I had already stopped.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.320
You stumbled over the boxes.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.780
Look, we aren't even blaming you.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.440
But what's with the attitude?

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.059
The first thing you do
is trying to dodge responsibility.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.200
And then you turn it around on us?

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.159
Exactly.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.340
I never meant that.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.559
I'm just explaining what happened.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.980
Oh, so what are you saying?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.220
That this is somehow my fault?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.000
Like I'm the one who should pay you

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.300
for all this junk on the ground?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.160
I didn't want

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.200
to pick a fight with a woman,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.380
but now I've had enough.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.740
Just pay for it in full.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.440
Ru,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.160
what's going on?

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.940
Xiguang.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.240
What happened?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.880
What are you doing here?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.060
Nianyuan,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.740
you know her?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.600
Xiguang,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.100
I was moving some stuff

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.040
to the venue just now.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.320
But the boxes were stacked so high

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.280
that they blocked my view.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.760
I kept calling out, "Excuse me,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.360
coming through,"

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.780
but we still ended up
crashing into each other.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.940
The thing is,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.080
I had already stopped.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.180
He wasn't paying attention

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.820
and walked right into me.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.160
Okay.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.180
I get it now.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.220
Nianyuan was right about you.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.000
You're really good at making excuses.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.600
Honestly, we weren't even going

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.900
to bother with you,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.020
since you probably couldn't afford
to pay us back anyway.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.980
But the way you keep
dodging responsibility

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.700
is honestly disgusting.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.180
Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.300
It's too early to say
who's dodging responsibility

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.140
or who's being difficult.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.600
Why don't we just ask the hotel

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.460
to check the security footage?

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.100
If it really is our fault,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.660
we'll apologize and pay up.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.440
But if it's on you,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.540
I expect an apology
and compensation as well.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.060
That's gonna take long.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.760
You're just wasting our time.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.620
Exactly.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.960
Our time is valuable.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.780
Likewise.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.860
Maybe it's you

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.020
who are wasting ours.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.520
Where did you crawl out from?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.580
Luo Ke,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.200
forget it.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.040
No point making a scene

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.960
over something so trivial.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.580
Besides, that rip in your jacket

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.860
is actually quite a look.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.660
Let's just drop it.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:19.960
Really?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.260
Yeah.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.040
It's giving total distressed punk.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.140
Fine.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.620
Since Mr. Zhao

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.320
has spoken up,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.140
I'll let you guys slide.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.220
You.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.580
Apologize to me.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.620
Show some respect
and stop making excuses.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.500
I'll act

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.260
like this never happened.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.140
Unless you'd rather pay me back

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.160
the tens of thousands this outfit cost.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.300
Tens of thousands?

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.080
I'm so...

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.600
No way.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.620
I still think
we should check the footage

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.740
and clear things up once and for all.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.320
Xiguang,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.240
let it go.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.780
His jacket costs a fortune.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.800
Just drop it.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.400
How about we just let them off?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.520
Honestly,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.700
maybe he really just stumbled.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.540
Luo Ke,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.280
forget it.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.900
Don't waste any more time on them.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.000
An apology isn't going

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.160
to change anything anyway.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.080
Besides, we're all starving.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.040
Just my luck.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.660
Let's just go.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.160
Sorry.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.580
I saw what happened.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.180
It really was my friend's fault.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.140
If there's any damage

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.140
to these items,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.920
you can come to me.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.620
I'll cover the compensation for him.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.280
That won't be necessary.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.260
If there really is any damage,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720
we'll just consider it our bad luck.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.440
I guess there's
at least one decent person among them.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.780
I mean, he actually admitted
they were wrong.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.260
Oh, please.
He's just playing nice after the fact.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.160
What's so "decent" about that?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.880
He knew it was
that guy's fault all along,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.960
yet he acted like he was doing us
a favor by letting it go.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.880
Didn't the way he handed over

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.700
his business card just now

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.720
make you want to cringe?

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.180
You're right.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.360
But Xiguang,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.320
you insisted on checking
the security footage,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.160
and I tried to stop you.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.560
Are you mad at me?

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.000
I just thought it was better

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.720
to avoid more trouble.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.220
I know it was frustrating,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.000
but as long as it's settled,
that's all that matters.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.800
And honestly, if the cameras

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.600
didn't catch anything,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.840
it would've been even harder to explain.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.480
That jacket costs tens of thousands.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.140
I couldn't even afford half of that.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.080
I understand.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.800
Thank you.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.580
If you hadn't been there,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.120
I wouldn't have known

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.160
what to do.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.140
But does that girl

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.240
know you?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.060
Will this cause problems for you?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.500
It's fine.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720
She's nobody.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:10.920
Don't worry about it.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.280
- He's here.
- Let's just wait a bit longer.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.680
No biggie.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.820
What were you just saying to them?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.800
Don't tell me you were hitting on them.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.100
No way.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.400
I was just checking
which company they're with.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.320
Right.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.200
Did you get it?

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.680
Why didn't that cross my mind?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
I can take it up with their boss later.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.580
They didn't dare tell me.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.480
Forget it.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.620
It's not worth the energy.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.800
Of course they didn't dare to.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.700
Let's drop it.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.740
We should be celebrating

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.500
Luo Ke making a killing.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.380
Look,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.700
I really owe

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.480
this one to Qian.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.220
My old man

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.300
is finally giving me the time of day.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.380
I should've put in more

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.320
back then.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.400
You couldn't have even if you wanted to.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.460
By the way,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.720
I was a bit skittish myself.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.820
Let's just take our time.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.500
Nianyuan,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.180
how'd you get mixed up
with those people?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.480
It's nothing.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.240
Everyone runs into that sort
now and then.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.940
Dinner's waiting. Let's move.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.780
Let's go.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.800
Qian,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.600
what's Nianyuan's deal, anyway?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.120
Give me the inside scoop.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.400
She's Nie Chengyuan's...

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.260
Her mom

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.300
was Nie's first love back then.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.240
But his family tore them apart.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.340
But as for Nianyuan,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.020
well, you know how it is.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.860
Merciful and Great Bodhisattva.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.340
[Qian Fangping]

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.460
Merciful and Great Bodhisattva.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.660
Merciful and Great Bodhisattva.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.600
Mom.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.040
Oh, it's just you.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.440
I heard a car outside

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.720
and thought Chengyuan was home.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.300
And I rushed over here to pray.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.440
You took his car out again?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.420
Mr. Nie said it was okay.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.340
Plus, he has a whole fleet of them.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.880
It's actually worse for cars
to just sit there.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.900
Thought you were in Suzhou

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.160
for a friend's birthday.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.760
Why

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.820
the long face?

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.040
Someone pissed you off?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.680
They were fine.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.340
No one pissed me off.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.060
Mom,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.960
I saw Nie Xiguang today.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.340
She seems to be working at some company.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.440
She was dressed like a slob,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.460
lugging boxes around,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.120
acting all poor

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.040
and hardworking.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.680
So pathetic.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.540
And she's just like she used to be,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.180
completely looking down her nose at me.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:22.900
Shut it.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.600
How many times have I told you

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.140
not to badmouth her?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.880
It's not like I'd say it
in front of Mr. Nie.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.660
Why are you getting on my case?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.240
Because you're an idiot.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.600
Once it becomes a habit,

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.540
it'll just slip out
when you least expect it.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.900
Why waste your time being bitter?

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480
Who cares if she

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.260
looks down on you?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.620
Keeping Mr. Nie happy
is all that matters.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.240
Say nice things about her

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.440
and give him exactly
what he wants to hear,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.800
got it?

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.340
Understood.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.760
Mom,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.560
do you remember two years ago,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.380
the first time Mr. Nie

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.740
took me to a banquet?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.880
We had to talk him into it for so long.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.160
It wasn't until he heard

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.480
Jiang Yun wasn't going

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.180
that he finally agreed

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.420
to take me along
to see a bit of the world.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.800
But who would've thought

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.839
we'd run into Nie Xiguang there?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.200
She wouldn't even

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:17.579
look me in the eye

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.900
the whole time,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.940
just like today.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.920
I don't know
what she told her dad later,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.640
but after that,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.400
Mr. Nie never took me

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.560
to these banquets again.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.300
Everyone in this circle

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.580
just froze me out.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.480
That's why I wanted to make some friends

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.520
from out of town.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.280
But then,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.600
there she was again.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.860
Mom,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.780
what if

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.780
she trashes me

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.820
to my friends in Suzhou?

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.040
Those people are the real deal.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.840
They've got serious clout.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.520
I was actually hoping

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.580
to pick their brains.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.640
There are so many people in this world.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.600
It's not like she knows
every single one of them.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.960
What are you so worried about?

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.920
She's probably just like her mother,

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.400
way too proud for her own good.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.020
As long as you don't confront
them head-on,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.360
they're not going to come after you.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.860
She's definitely badmouthing me

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.540
to her mother this very second.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.140
Luckily, I had the sense

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.900
to stay quiet

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.340
when I met her.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.040
Zoned out? You're so quiet.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.640
No.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.860
Something

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.100
happened today.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.280
So that's basically what happened.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.880
You did great.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.320
So why the gloom and doom?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.700
I'm not upset.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.860
I've just been stuck
in my head about it.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.920
Ru actually apologized later

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.460
for stopping me

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.200
from checking the cameras.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.160
But thinking back on it now,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.300
I'm the one
who didn't really think it through.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:34.960
Look,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.800
I'm not afraid of compensation.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.180
What I care about

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.160
is the principle.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.800
If it's my fault,

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.520
I'll pay up and apologize.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.320
But you can't pin it on me.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.740
I won't just sit there
and take the blame.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.300
But I only say that

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.740
because

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.120
I can afford to.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.560
But for Ru,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.620
this is

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.300
a huge risk.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.380
If she wants

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.880
to just sweep it under the rug,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.920
I shouldn't have taken it upon myself

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.960
to demand the security footage.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.440
But you didn't insist on it,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.580
did you?

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.680
Well, I came to my senses
pretty quickly.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.460
I'm just trying

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.800
to wrap my head around it all.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.460
If you hadn't

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.220
stood your ground from the start,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.220
a bully like that

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.440
wouldn't have just let it go.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.780
You held up under pressure

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.700
and went toe-to-toe with them.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.200
But then, at the crucial moment,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.940
you read the room

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.000
and knew exactly when to pull back.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.420
That's why it was settled so fast.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.320
That was a masterclass.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.760
You should be proud.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.800
Are you

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.400
just really good
at seeing the best in people?

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.300
The way you say it

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.880
makes me feel like
I'm actually a big deal.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.540
Think about it.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.840
Am I right?

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.840
I guess so.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.440
Maybe I really am that capable.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.720
Then it's settled.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.640
Miss Nie, you have all the qualities

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.180
it takes

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.420
to be a great boss.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.120
Okay, stop it with the praise.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.700
Every time you do that,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.000
I feel like you're about
to give me a huge assignment.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.800
This must be some kind of tactic.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.980
Did you minor in psychology
or something?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.060
As a matter of fact, I did.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.700
I knew you had a trick up your sleeve.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.980
That was a total psychological tactic.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.560
If I were actually good at mind games,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.320
I wouldn't use them
to trick you into working.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.560
Then what would you use them for?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.560
Eat up.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.500
The noodles are going to get all soggy.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.680
I have a question.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.920
Who is...

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.520
that Mr. Zhao?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.340
How should I know?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.860
He seemed so fake.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
I didn't even look at his business card.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.920
I just couldn't be bothered with him.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.020
Good call.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.280
This meal is on me.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.960
Wasn't it your treat anyway?

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:19.980
Oh, by the way,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.960
I set up the table for you and Mr. Zhang

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.440
to write
Chinese New Year couplets tomorrow.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.260
Look.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:29.800
Check this out.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.200
I cleared away some of the decorations

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.920
and took down

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.560
the balloons.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.940
I'm bribing my boss for less overtime.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.540
Report me to the police

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.540
and see who they'd arrest.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.740
Oh my,

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.840
I'm starting to lose this argument.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.340
That's because I'm right.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.280
So,

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.220
are you heading back
to Shanghai for the holidays?

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.560
No,

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.860
Beijing this year.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.120
I used to spend it

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.540
in Switzerland every year.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.080
My mom lives there,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.340
but she's back in China

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.700
for a meeting with Mr. Luo.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.240
Saves me the long flight.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.660
Mr. Luo?

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.060
Her current husband.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.060
My dad

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.100
passed away a long time ago.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.380
I'm sorry.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:48.960
It's okay.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.200
It's been years.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.380
Last time you mentioned

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.100
you were going skiing
in Changbai Mountain?

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.480
My mom, my uncle's family, and I

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.980
are spending
Chinese New Year's Eve in Wuxi,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.800
then we're flying there together
on the Spring Festival.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.940
How's your skiing, anyway?

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.800
I'm still constantly braking
on the bunny slope.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.940
Plus, I haven't been skiing in years.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.080
That's not bad.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.660
Sounds like you're a cautious skier.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.780
Skis?

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.340
Do you know how to ski?

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.540
Whenever I'm in Switzerland,

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.260
I spend most of my time

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.220
on the slopes.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.700
I mean, there's

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.920
really nothing else to do abroad.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.380
So, do you ski or snowboard?

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.480
I used to ski,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.040
but I switched to snowboarding
a couple of years ago.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.340
So you do both?

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.800
Are you bluffing?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.940
It's not that hard.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.600
Just takes a bit of time, that's all.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.260
I just realized

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.780
I haven't finished

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.500
my yearly goals yet.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.520
So, what are you going to do?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.580
Nothing much.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.640
Honestly, I've always been
someone in a rush.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.900
I was always trying
to skip grades back in school.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.540
I tried to cram two days' worth

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.880
of effort into one at work.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.020
But for the first time,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.680
I find taking things slow like this,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.320
and getting to know

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.740
someone,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.540
are really good.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.480
I'm heading up.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.080
Okay.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.400
See you next year.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.680
See you next year.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.160
One more braised fish
and we can start eating.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.780
I want it sweet and sour.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.720
I know.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.540
In it goes!

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.160
Starting the fish now?

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.740
Call your son.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.100
Okay.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.520
It's getting so late,
and he's still not back.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.080
Where are you?

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.140
How much longer?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.020
Your mom has almost finished cooking.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.600
Dad,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.680
I ran into some people
at the village entrance

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.780
and got held up chatting.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.060
What are you doing over there?

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.720
Get back here, now.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.760
Hello?

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.080
Where are you?

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.020
Mom,

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.400
I'm already in the village.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.000
Chengyuan.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.540
You came back alone?

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.540
Wait, that voice in the background...

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.380
Are you at Qian Fangping's?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.560
I just gave them a lift on my way.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.680
Get back here now!

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.240
Or don't bother coming home at all!

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.420
Once the fish is ready,

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.680
we'll go ahead without him.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.040
Let's dig in.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.000
Are we really not waiting for him?

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.800
No.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.700
Okay, let's eat then.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.880
Don't be mad,

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.100
it's Chinese New Year anyway.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.960
Sure.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.720
I've lost count of

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.800
how many times I told him

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.120
when he was a kid

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.520
that old man Qian is no good.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:22.980
He's rotten to the core.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.480
But your dad just wouldn't listen,

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.760
always hanging around them.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.040
I'm so humiliated

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.300
because of him.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.700
Grandpa,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.320
how come

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.580
you never told me any of this
when I was a kid?

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.480
By the time you were born,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.580
your grandma and I were older and wiser.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.560
We learned to only talk
behind your back.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.320
We could never say
these things to your face.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.000
What if you accidentally

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.100
let it slip to your mom?

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.240
Then she'd think
we're the kind of people

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.880
who love to gossip
behind people's backs.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.200
That wouldn't look good at all.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.320
So,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.080
what exactly did

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.720
this Qian guy do?

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.320
Oh, he did

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.360
way too many shady things.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.080
He even stole sweet potatoes,
their only survival rations,

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.300
from a widow and her child
in the East Village.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:04.860
And remember when we were

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.180
working on the old house?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.800
He even came and stole our timber.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.020
That's right.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.460
Back in the day,

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.500
when your dad started
dating Qian Fangping,

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.940
we were totally against it.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.420
But your dad kept saying

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.720
that she was

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.840
nothing like her dad.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.720
My chest literally ached
from the sheer frustration.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.120
I was so livid.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.600
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.320
from now on,
whenever you're gossiping like this,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.960
count me in.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.000
I love hearing this stuff.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.840
Dad, Mom,

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:40.900
Xiguang.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.100
You guys really didn't wait for me,
did you?

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.140
Dad.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.360
Don't be like that, okay?

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.940
I got held up on the way

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.780
and ended up chatting for a bit.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.100
You know,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.940
your son is quite a big name
around here now.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.800
I can't just ignore

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.780
others in the village.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.460
Otherwise, they'll say
I've grown too big for my boots

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.880
now that I have some money.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.280
Just sit down and eat.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.860
It's Chinese New Year, after all.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.760
I'm only letting this slide
because of Guang.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.620
Dad,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.780
I gave you two cases

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.720
of Moutai last time.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.660
Why are you still drinking this stuff?

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.760
I'm used to this.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.800
The Moutai is in the cabinet.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.940
If you want some, pour it yourself.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:30.800
Never mind.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.860
Too much Moutai gets tiring.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.120
I'll try something different
for a change.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.760
How's work going for you in Suzhou?

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.100
It's alright.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.760
"Alright" could mean anything.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.060
Either it's good or it's not.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.620
So what do you mean exactly?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.800
Look, you're my daughter.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.500
I'm happy you're willing to start

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.420
from the bottom to gain experience.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.780
But being at the grassroots is different

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.500
from being in management.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.460
Besides,

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.100
looking at the PV market today,

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.740
what's the point of staying there?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.360
You might as well come back sooner.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.420
I can set you up

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.640
with a position in my company.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.500
You'll turn 23 after Chinese New Year.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.760
It's about time you started

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.220
thinking about settling down.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.880
A young woman
drifting all alone in another city.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.120
What kind of life is that?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.380
Guang,

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.300
have some fish.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.780
I left it on the stove a bit longer
so it'd really

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.420
soak up the flavor.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.760
Eat up.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:22.880
When exactly

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.780
are you leaving
for Changbai Mountain tomorrow?

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.340
The flight's at noon.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.960
You're going to Changbai Mountain
with your mom?
