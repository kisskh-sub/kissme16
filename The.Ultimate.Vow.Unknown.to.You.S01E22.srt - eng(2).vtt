00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
Miss, you cannot enter the palace.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.000
Make way.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.040
He is His Majesty.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.120
Your biological father.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.200
Qingping.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.480
I've come to see you.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.680
It's been three years.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.520
Do you remember this jade pendant?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.560
I should have recognized you as a Northern Desert spy long ago.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.870
Qingru, look, isn't this fun?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.750
It's fun.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.680
Do you like it?

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.520
I like it.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.910
Then, Mother will buy one for you, okay?

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.560
Okay.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.000
Shopkeeper, how much for one?

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.910
Two wen.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.470
Alright.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.680
But I still softened my heart.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.400
I let you live in the palace.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.520
I let you take care of Qingru.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.470
Until I discovered...

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.800
You wanted to take her back to the Northern Desert.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.080
I am the Emperor.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000
I could not let you take her away.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.870
Even less could I let you tell her of her origins.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.030
Yes.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360
I was cruel-hearted.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.520
But I had no other choice.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.310
I had no choice.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.910
Qingru has grown up. That is good.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.190
Very happy.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.120
At least happier than if she knew the truth...

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.910
...would make her.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.430
Assassin!

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.680
Qingping...

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.280
Please forgive me.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.150
We are all people with no control over our fate.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.520
Why have you hidden it from me until now?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.120
He is your biological father.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.150
He is the Son of Heaven.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.360
What can you possibly do?

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.470
Killing him would only cost you your life.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.310
But I have wrongly blamed Yuwen Que for so many years.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.280
My hatred has wounded him deeply.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.710
I must enter the palace.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.030
Then I will go with you.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.960
No.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.430
You stay and take care of him.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.480
His injuries are not yet healed.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.680
But you...

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.120
This is what I owe him.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.600
A-Ru.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.310
She's gone.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.870
What does this mean?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.360
Cangzhou is about to change.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720
What do you know?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.310
Take your men.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.120
Be ready to provide support.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.270
What is she going to do?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.480
What she intends to do...

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.040
...is what you wish to do.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.720
Your Highness, all preparations are complete.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.750
Pass down the order.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.870
Guard the city gates strictly.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.160
Without my command...

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.560
...no one is to act without authorization.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.870
This general obeys.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.600
Qingru.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.800
I pray you come to no harm.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.680
Qingping...

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.000
Today is the anniversary of your death.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.720
I've come to see you.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.720
All these years, from the bottom of my heart...

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.480
Qingping.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.390
Your Majesty, do you still remember the blood from that night?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.510
You...

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.950
You...

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.000
You are not...

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.680
Why did you want to kill me that night?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.190
I... I did it for the empire.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480
The empire?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.630
For the empire, you would sever the bond between us?

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.920
No, I...

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.070
I didn't.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.040
Do you still remember...

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.510
...that sword was the one you personally...

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.630
Your Majesty!

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.000
Have you heard?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.600
There's a ghost in the palace tonight.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.190
Isn't it just?

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.750
It must be the spirit of the Lady.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.720
You don't know, but there's someone...

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.480
...who was scared out of his wits.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.040
Enough talk. Let's hurry and leave.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.680
Mother, I finally know the truth.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.920
This is only the beginning.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.160
Y-Your Highness...

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.360
Who wounded you?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.560
Heng Dao.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160
Lord Heng Dao, he...

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.950
...said you were already...

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.040
Don't rush.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.480
Speak slowly.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.600
He said...

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.190
...you died in battle against the enemy forces.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.480
He even produced your blood-stained cloak.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.000
And then?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.040
The officers and soldiers all believed it.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.160
He took your command token...

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.750
...and took away all the Mobei Iron Cavalry.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.390
Your Highness...

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.560
You must be careful.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.870
I saw...

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.630
...I saw Lord Heng Dao...

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.270
...often meeting late at night...

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.680
...meeting with a...

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.560
...a...

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.600
Rest assured, I will give you justice.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.800
It hasn't even been an hour.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.670
Your Highness, do not fear.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.270
Your subordinate is here.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.240
What fine protection with your life.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.150
You've been following me all along...

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.510
...just waiting for this day, haven't you?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.200
My lord, everything has been arranged.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.200
Is the army under control?

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.790
They all believe the Crown Prince is dead.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.840
With the military command in hand...

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.390
...they can only obey my orders.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.390
Excellent.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.870
Remember, three days from now at midnight...

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.270
...open the city gates.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.670
However...

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.960
If the Crown Prince is still alive...

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.630
...we must see him alive...

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.360
...or see his corpse.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.360
Before then...

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.480
...the Northern Desert army is under your control.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.670
Imperial Father.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.840
Your child has come to accompany you.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.550
Imperial Father, do you remember...

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.790
...that rainy night three years ago?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.270
This was left by my mother.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.200
It still bears her bloodstains.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.630
What's wrong? Are you scared?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.870
Back then, my mother was just like this.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.790
She fell, covered in blood.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.600
Do you know?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.840
All these years,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.720
I always thought it was Yuwen Que

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.150
who killed my mother.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.240
But you...

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.360
you are the true murderer.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.030
Before she died, Mother said

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.030
the thing she regretted most in her life

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.360
was believing in your sincerity.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.870
Was this empire

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.270
really worth you killing the one you loved with your own hands?

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.480
Mother,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.510
your daughter has avenged you.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.790
Su Changji.
