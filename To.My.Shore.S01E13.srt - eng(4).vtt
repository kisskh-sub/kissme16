00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:17.479
A wind that only seems gentle

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:28.119
Who is laughing at my madness

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.560
yet indulges my startled heart

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.959
I see through your mask

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:44.159
and let you probe my limits

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.758
It is I who indulge

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.400
Love blazes like fire

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.839
spreading

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.638
and the flame that collides at our lips

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.000
fiercer than any tender lingering

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.838
a duel that stakes our pride

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:18.080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:23.319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.278
mad notion

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:33.400
made real

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:40.719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:54.839
You are my abyss

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.918
You are my

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.479
sunshine

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.999
"To My Shore"
(Episode 13)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.039
Our product is now
confirmed in four formats.

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.039
However,

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:21.720
This optimization really

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.038
needs to be quickly refined

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.639
by leveraging our product advantages.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:25.679
Especially

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.919
the children's version,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.399
which is our main product this quarter.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.559
The latest sorted materials.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.920
Thank you, everyone, for your hard work.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:43.999
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.039
Everyone, please stop what you're doing.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.800
Our project

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.119
succeeded.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.639
A success!

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.039
Great!

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.120
Thank you all for your efforts.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.560
Thank you all for your efforts.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960
Great!

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.880
Let me take a look.
Look, look.

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.639
I told you it was possible.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.639
Awesome!

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.039
Really good.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.119
We finally did it.

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:10.519
When we first started the experiment,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.320
never imagined it would be so quick.
Professor Huang.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.000
The internal tests have passed.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.639
We can proceed to submission.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880
Okay.

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.119
Shulang

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.080
I knew you could do it.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.039
President Fan.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.800
The internal tests are done.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.119
We can prepare the final payment.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080
You Shulang.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.639
How's he doing?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.119
He's doing very well now.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.960
Just like you envisioned,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.879
once he's immersed in R&D,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.440
he has a new foundation to support him.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.160
Looking at him now,

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.160
he's back to his old self, shining.

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.960
And where is he now...?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320
He said

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.399
he'll go home once the wrap-up is done.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.279
Home.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.360
Finally, it's over.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.320
Xiao Tian.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.519
You scared me!

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.360
I'm happy!

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.839
Are you not happy, Brother Zhou?

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:10.880
I am.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.216
I've practically been living
at the plant for the past while.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.960
If I don't go back soon,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.479
my daughter won't recognize me.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.399
I promised her.
Once the project's done,

00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.535
I'd take her to the amusement park
for a whole day of fun.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.279
I'm leaving now.
Goodbye, Brother Zhou.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.799
Xiao You.
Xiao Li

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm leaving now.
Goodbye, Brother Zhou.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880
See you.

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:27.678
I've also promised my girlfriend

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:28.959
to spend her birthday with her.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:30.079
I was afraid of a delay.

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:31.600
Luckily, we finished early.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.640
I'm going to eat like a pig.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.519
I lost my appetite with how busy I've been.

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:36.679
Exactly.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.200
You, Brother You.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.600
What are you planning to do?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920
Me?

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.279
I...

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.239
Brother You,
what are you thinking?

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.239
Nothing.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.160
Sleep.

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:51.159
I'm going to sleep for
three days and nights.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.118
What I think is, we really
owe it to You this time.

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:55.798
You had to manage all the departments,

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:57.118
plus take on some hands-on tasks.

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:58.000
Nonstop.

00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.399
If it wasn't for You, we wouldn't have
finished this so efficiently. Not a chance.

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:03.639
As expected of my idol,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.959
he's handsome and capable.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200
Stop fangirling.

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:07.359
Stop bothering me.

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:08.200
It's time to clock out.
Let's go.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.519
Brother You.
You're not leaving?

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.399
I'll stay a bit.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480
You guys head out first.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.839
Okay.
Goodbye, Brother You.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.239
We'll head out first.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.518
We've been so busy these days

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.159
that we've lost touch with the world.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.000
Dead tired.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.399
Let's go.

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:37.799
Where're you going?

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.679
You take your time.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.480
The Garden District.

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:47.799
Okay.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.079
Bai Ting, are you free?

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.119
I'm passing by your place.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.040
Only if it's not a bother,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.279
let's grab a bite.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.959
Bai Ting.

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:21.040
Thanks for helping me this time.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.320
If you need it,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.959
I can introduce you to a new job.

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.399
No need.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.078
I'm used to this line of work now.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.880
It doesn't gross me out like before.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.239
I want to make real money.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Buy a place.

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:40.600
Buy a car.

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:42.640
And never depend on anyone again.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.600
Money means strength.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.320
It means control over your fate.

00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:00.934
[Looking at the no-response from Bai Ting]

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.399
Who?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.559
Are you Bai Ting's friend?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.720
I am.

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:23.200
Isn't she home?

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:24.919
I don't know where she is.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.239
I was going to ask you.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.960
What happened to Bai Ting?

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.679
I don't know.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.799
A couple of days ago at the club,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.600
she got a call.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.639
She looked rattled.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.399
She hurried home.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:40.079
Then we lost contact.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.799
She disappeared into thin air.

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:45.040
All her stuff is still here.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.359
Have you asked her other friends?

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:50.079
Bai Ting doesn't have many friends.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.239
Then.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.519
Do you know who called her?

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:57.640
Has anything unusual happened recently?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.119
The call...

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:01.920
Not sure who it was.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.040
Anything unusual?

00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:06.040
I don't know if this counts.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.479
There was a guy before.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.160
He booked a huge room.

00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:11.239
He specifically requested only her.

00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.279
But didn't stay long before he left.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.798
Ordered expensive booze.

00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:17.119
Didn't touch a drop.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.679
What kind of guy?

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.399
He was tall and handsome.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.119
He had good manners.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.959
Any distinct features?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Nothing special.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Oh, wait...

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.000
He lit his smokes with matches.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.159
Doesn't everyone use lighters now?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760
You Shulang.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.239
You've really come back.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.598
The old you has truly returned.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:28.599
I missed you so much.

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:29.200
These past months,
I can't even imagine

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.359
how I managed to survive.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.736
I went to the places
we used to visit together.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.320
I watched the movies we used to watch.

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:38.200
I even learned a few new Thai dishes.

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.559
You'll definitely like them.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:42.919
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.200
I'll cook for you.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.359
But those dishes take a bit of time.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.080
Let me think.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.840
I'll make you some
seafood pineapple fried rice.

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.359
You go rest in your room first.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.760
I'll be right there.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.119
Fan Xiao.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:00.239
I came here today to ask you a few things.

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:03.479
The project is about to finish.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.238
Are you planning something again?

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:06.960
New ways to threaten me?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.640
What do you mean?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.520
Did you meet with Bai Ting?

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.118
Now, Changling Pharma

00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:23.840
no longer has any leverage on you.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.800
My brother has received
the punishment he deserves.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.479
So now you're thinking about her?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.479
You Shulang.

00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:34.119
What?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.400
Where is Bai Ting?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.039
So,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.920
You came here today to
question me about this?

00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:42.953
Is this what you came to ask me about?

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.479
Between us,

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.559
what else is there to talk about?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.799
Where did you hide Bai Ting?

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:00.760
All I feel now when I see you is disgust.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.799
No other feelings.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.679
I don't know.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.400
How you survived these past three months,

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:08.960
But these past three months for me,

00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:12.119
have been the easiest of my life.

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:16.280
Life without you has been blissful.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.039
It's been wonderful.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.479
Fan Xiao

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:23.599
I don't want to argue with you today.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:24.799
Just tell me

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:26.513
where is Bai Ting?

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.400
She's dead.

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:28.640
Bai Ting is dead.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.119
She didn't have to die.

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:31.320
She forced me.

00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.520
You forced me.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.559
What did you do?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.760
What did I do?

00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:40.039
You Shulang.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.559
You have too many weaknesses.

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:43.919
Bai Ting.

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.159
Huang Qimin.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.719
And your troublesome brother,

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:49.840
they are all your weak spots.

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:51.987
Don't think that without them...

00:11:52.393 --> 00:11:54.273
I have no way to deal with you.

00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:57.320
I want to keep you by my side.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.599
Your foster mother's spirit in heaven

00:12:01.073 --> 00:12:03.073
will bless me.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.000
Fan Xiao.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.679
She's already resting in peace.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.200
What more do you want to do?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.719
Are you even human?

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:14.320
In your eyes,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.559
wasn't I already a devil to you?

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400
Fan Xiao.

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:26.719
You are indeed a devil.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.559
But don't devils have soft spots?

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:36.239
This

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.799
is proof of your crimes.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:40.640
You guys evaded taxes,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.119
bribed officials,

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:44.880
which of these wouldn't
land you in prison for years?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:47.599
This

00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:50.376
was your big brother's way of using illegal
methods to pressure your sister-in-law.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.320
Using illegal methods

00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:53.641
is proof of suppressing his
father's company through crime.

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.359
And this

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.919
was your father's criminal evidence.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.280
He was making and
selling counterfeit products.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:01.799
These are drugs.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.320
They are critical to living.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.559
And he still dared to fake them.

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:08.559
So,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.520
what do you want to do?

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:16.919
As long as I hit send,

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:18.559
You

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.280
and your entire family's criminal evidence

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.520
will be sent to the media

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.559
and to the judicial authorities.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.520
Would you really do this to me?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.559
You Shulang.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.000
Would I?

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:47.000
Will I?

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:52.159
I once wanted to give
you the best of everything.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.320
As long as I could do it,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.200
I thought

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:05.080
you were heaven's gift to a lonely man.

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.799
A gift to compensate for my loneliness.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.520
I cherished it deeply.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.320
But the joke's on me.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:27.960
That candy I ate

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.679
was poisoned.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520
Fan Xiao.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You weren't a gift from heaven.

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.679
You were punishment.

00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:45.840
Not just for me,

00:14:46.472 --> 00:14:48.873
But for everyone around me.

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:50.039
President Fan.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:54.599
Tell me really,
what do you want to do?

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.080
These

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.718
originally were things I discovered,

00:14:58.719 --> 00:15:00.520
Their criminal evidence

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.520
I was planning to use
them to threaten them later.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.080
But now,

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:13.559
I ended up shooting
myself in the foot first.

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:15.880
But Director You,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.919
Your heart is too soft.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.840
Could you really send me to prison?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760
Fan Xiao.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.039
You say

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.039
your gift is me,

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:48.080
Your punishment is also me.

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.080
I won't let you leave me.

00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:51.719
Fan Xiao.

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:54.599
Fan Xiao.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.479
Don't push me.

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:01.753
I've een pushing you for so long.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.960
When haven't I won?

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.239
Accept your fate.

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:17.080
Because I hope when I'm scared,
you'll be there.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880
If you're there,

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.359
I'll feel more at ease.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.719
I can crawl at your feet

00:16:27.873 --> 00:16:30.672
but not as a sinner.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.000
We

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:42.599
Should break up.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.239
If you leave Changling

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.960
leave me,

00:16:47.719 --> 00:16:50.400
Then your half a lifetime of
Professor Huang's hard work

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:52.760
will go up in flames.

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:57.559
Looks like Director You

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.520
doesn't care about anyone anymore.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.760
Do you need me to

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:05.920
ask your brother for you?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.599
You said

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.238
everyone has to pay for

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:11.079
the wrong things they've done.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.040
President Huang

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.280
Zhang Chen

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.800
They all did wrong.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.280
But Bai Ting didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.359
She was just trying to help you.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.959
I'm not the Bodhisattva
you keep calling me.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.719
I can't save you.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040
Not even

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
I can't even save myself.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.680
You can't bring yourself to do it.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.000
Let me help you.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.400
Bodhisattva

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.680
I will atone.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.839
You're free.

00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:33.879
Next, we continue with international news.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.118
Considered to have shaken
the Thai pharmaceutical industry,

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:38.039
The counterfeit and illegal drug
case of the Nanwa family has,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.679
after months of investigation,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.319
collecting evidence and making arrests,

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:44.160
finally, the case reached a
verdict at the National Court.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.280
Not only did the case uproot

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:48.445
Thailand's pharmaceutical
monopoly, the Fan Group,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.615
but also implicated politicians
from neighboring countries,

00:18:50.639 --> 00:18:52.679
with amounts and crimes
rarely seen in Thai history.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.399
The scope of the crimes, including

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.559
the amount involved,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.040
has rarely been seen in Thailand's history.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.679
According to local media,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.920
The case was reported by an insider,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.479
who provided detailed, direct evidence.

00:19:04.504 --> 00:19:06.264
And straightforward data.

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:07.319
Driver.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.760
Change the music, please.

00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:28.479
Hello?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.119
You, where are you?

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.359
Almost there.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.079
Just past the next light.

00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:34.760
You guys go ahead.

00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:39.680
Why is You Shulang still not here?
Exactly.

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:41.896
It's already ten o'clock, still not here.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.680
Sorry,
I'm late.

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:44.199
Here.

00:19:44.439 --> 00:19:45.439
Everyone's here.

00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:46.656
We've just been waiting for you.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.536
Been waiting half a day for you.
Why did you arrive so late?

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.359
Exactly.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.159
Didn't you say you were in
seclusion preparing for exams?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.376
You'll be fine after the exams are over.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.639
You've always had great results.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.319
You'll be fine.
Thanks.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920
Studying full-time?

00:19:56.199 --> 00:19:57.199
While on the job.

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:58.599
Once you pass this

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.240
You'll have your
pick of the litter then.

00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:03.920
Can't wait.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.719
Come on.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.400
Did you see that news from Thailand?

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:09.479
What news?

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:10.199
About Thailand,

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.319
I know, I know.

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:12.359
Of course you know.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.040
You, Shulang,

00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:15.000
You were in Thailand?

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.520
What's going on with you two?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.078
We haven't even finished
talking about the litter.

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:21.040
Why are you changing the subject?

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.160
I knew it.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.118
You're pretending to study hard

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:25.800
Your motives aren't pure.

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:28.199
His motives aren't pure.

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:54.459
(Medical Diagnosis "Three
Fundamentals" Training Doctor's Handbook)

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.479
I can fly a plastic bag high.

00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:21.079
Even higher than a kite.

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:23.920
Director You, want to see it?

00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:26.599
If you want, I'll fly one for you.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.640
Mr. You

00:21:58.839 --> 00:21:59.839
Long time no see.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.880
I didn't expect you to really come.

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:03.319
Please sit.

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:04.599
Sit down.

00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:08.239
Sit down.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.880
This is...

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.560
I've got cancer.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.400
I've don't have long to live.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.160
The doctor said

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:19.040
Everyone in my family

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.599
We all carry this bug inside us.

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:24.239
My son's is in his brain.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:26.040
Mine's in my liver.

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:28.680
I heard the boy has recovered.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
Back then,

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:33.640
thanks to you

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:34.839
and President Fan,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.680
you saved our Tiantian.

00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:37.680
Yes,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.119
His name's Tiantian.

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:41.959
Back then,

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:44.079
I brought him back home

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.959
He had two surgeries

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.400
And several rounds of chemo.

00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:49.719
Doctor said

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.599
He's fine now.

00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:53.239
Don't worry too much.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.760
You'll be just fine, like Tiantian.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.160
I'm done for.

00:23:05.199 --> 00:23:07.479
They've issued the
critical condition notice.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800
To be honest,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.239
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:14.280
I've never made a name
for myself in this life.

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:16.359
But

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.000
If I die,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.800
what will happen to Tiantian?

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.400
He's still so young.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.160
If I'm gone,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.040
what will happen to him?

00:23:31.495 --> 00:23:33.599
In this world

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.560
I'm his only family.

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.800
He's still so young.

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:41.079
I can't be at peace this way.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
Mr. You

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.640
I know you're a good person.

00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:52.574
Tiantian's life,

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.959
was given by you.

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:56.560
You're like his second parents.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:58.599
I know.

00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.839
If I die,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.160
Tiantian will surely be
sent to the orphanage.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.479
When that time comes,
could I trouble you...

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520
please,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.880
go visit him at the orphanage

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400
I know

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.040
This will surely cause you a lot of trouble

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520
But

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.079
I have no other way.

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:21.400
You and President
Fan are all I can think of.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.479
I can't reach him by phone.

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:25.880
Only you picked up.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.800
Mr. You

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.880
Tiantian is very well-behaved.

00:24:30.565 --> 00:24:32.045
He's still so small.

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:33.920
He hardly ever cries.

00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:35.719
All you need to do is

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.280
visit him often at the orphanage,

00:24:37.574 --> 00:24:39.174
see if he's doing well,

00:24:39.199 --> 00:24:40.519
if he's healthy or not,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.718
if he's happy,

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:43.079
just make sure he's happy, okay?

00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:44.239
Is that okay? I'm begging you.
Ms. Wu

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.800
Please don't get too emotional.

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:47.959
Please,

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:49.680
Let's sit down and talk slowly.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:56.119
Conditions at the orphanage

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.040
are much better than before.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.200
You don't need to worry too much.

00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:06.471
They won't go hungry,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.640
they won't be cold either.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640
But

00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:12.280
what I hope for

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800
in this world

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:17.079
there will be someone to care for him,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.719
and someone he can care about.

00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:22.806
Mr. You

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.799
Tiantian is still small.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.239
He doesn't remember things.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.880
He'll forget me soon.

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:34.239
And then, in this world,

00:25:35.199 --> 00:25:37.999
if he doesn't have anyone to care for him,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.920
how sad would that be?

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:41.640
If

00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:44.160
He has you by his side,

00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:46.886
I could leave in peace.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.400
Mothers are always selfish.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.200
We always think of our children first.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:05.959
Their well-being comes first.

00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:08.239
Mr. You

00:26:08.959 --> 00:26:11.000
If you feel it's too much to ask,

00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:13.000
Then I...

00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:15.000
Mom

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.920
Mom

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:18.920
Mom
Tiantian

00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:21.479
Why did you guys come?

00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.280
He insisted on looking for Mom.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520
Tiantian's mom

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.880
It's almost New Year.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.718
My husband and child
are urging me to go back.

00:26:29.719 --> 00:26:30.759
You should find the new nanny.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.000
Quickly find one.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800
Tiantian

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:43.079
Hello.

00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:44.199
Call Uncle.

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:49.599
Hello, Uncle.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.000
Good boy.
Tiantian

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.160
Stop messing around.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.598
Get off Uncle.

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:56.719
I just like Uncle.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.040
I've done everything you asked.

00:27:05.239 --> 00:27:07.079
Do you think he'll adopt Tiantian?

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:10.159
What's the connection
between that child and him?

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.760
He's not a kitten or a puppy.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.320
You can't just adopt him on a whim.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.359
What if you're wrong?

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.880
What if You Shulang doesn't adopt Tiantian?

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:20.599
Then I'll adopt him.

00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:23.479
What?

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:25.280
You'll adopt him?

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:28.880
Why do I feel
like I don't even know you anymore?

00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:31.640
That's the child we saved together.

00:27:32.199 --> 00:27:33.839
He will grow up happy.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.719
Someone will tell him

00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:38.040
That this world is not so bad.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.760
He will become the bond You Shulang wanted.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.160
In this world

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.359
The bond that belongs to him.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.400
What you said

00:27:55.479 --> 00:27:57.400
What you said is true.

00:27:57.479 --> 00:27:58.479
Yes.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.479
I brought all of my

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.976
documentation and financial info.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.160
And property information.

00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:06.319
You can take a look.

00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:08.280
Also,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.560
If you have any other questions,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.040
you can ask me.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.719
I

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920
I

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.079
I'll live in the next life as your servant.

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:19.640
Lie down quickly.
I

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.239
Thank you so much.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280
Lie down quickly.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.959
Thank you.

00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:27.626
Actually, adopting Tiantian

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.680
I have my selfish reasons.

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:31.920
I'm also an orphan.

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:34.640
Life alone is too lonely.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.880
I hope Tiantian can be my companion.

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:42.279
And there's one more
thing that's very important.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.119
Ms. Wu

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.959
You need to think about it carefully.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.640
This is why it took me a
few days to come see you.

00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:01.839
I'm gay.

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.879
If you think my sexual orientation

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.959
could cause any
negative impact to Tiantian,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.479
you can reject me.

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:11.359
It doesn't matter.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.640
None of that matters.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.520
It's New Year.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560
New Year.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.119
Even if I'm alone,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.160
I still need to have some dumplings.

00:29:58.599 --> 00:29:59.599
No vinegar?

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:02.040
Boss, some vinegar please.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:02.880
Alright.
Coming right up.

00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:08.800
Bai Ting

00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:11.000
You Shulang

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:14.319
Here, You Shulang.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.839
Eat while it's hot.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.719
Here.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920
Chopsticks.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800
Thank you.

00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:30.119
So... you...

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.719
what's going on here?

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:35.680
I called you before,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.880
But no one picked up.
Did you eat?

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.199
Let's go once you've eaten.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880
Boss, the bill's paid.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160
Come again next time.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.160
I guess, I'm just... reformed.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.719
Sorry.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.560
I didn't even tell you.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.400
I just wanted to cut all
ties with everything before.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.160
Keep things clean.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.199
Did I make you worry?

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.319
I should have told you earlier.

00:31:09.719 --> 00:31:11.000
I understand you.

00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:12.640
If it were me,

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.640
I would have done the same.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.920
Tastes pretty good.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:29.079
Did you make this?

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520
Yeah.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.319
Bai Ting

00:31:46.839 --> 00:31:48.000
Don't worry.

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:50.599
I won't bother you again.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:01.040
This player... please
restart your life.

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:06.800
Thank you, You Shulang.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.680
If there's a chance,

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.680
please thank President Fan for me.

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:16.319
Thank who?

00:32:16.719 --> 00:32:17.959
Fan Xiao

00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:20.000
President Fan is called Fan Xiao, right?

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:23.136
Did you hurt your hand, should I...

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160
No worries.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.959
Over half a year ago,

00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:34.560
I was at the nightclub.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.400
I didn't want to do the dirty work.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.760
A floor boss there
wanted to get back at me.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.959
They brought my dad and brother in.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.119
They tried to drug me,
to force me to go back.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.079
What happened then?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.800
How did this get tied to Fan Xiao?

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.040
I had no way out.

00:32:56.199 --> 00:32:58.239
The only person I could turn to was you.

00:32:58.839 --> 00:32:59.999
But when I called you,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.239
I couldn't reach you at all.

00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:02.719
Finally,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.479
I contacted President Fan.

00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:09.839
He had left me his contact info
when he wanted me to threaten you.

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.160
He said

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:15.400
you were busy with
an important project.

00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:17.680
You were very busy.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.079
We didn't want to trouble you with this.

00:33:20.199 --> 00:33:21.799
He said he would take care of it for me.

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:26.040
President Fan arranged for
me to stay at a place outside.

00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:27.359
And let me hide for a while.

00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:31.199
But out there,

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.479
while hiding away,

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.520
these quiet days

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.239
were actually pretty nice.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.959
So I took my remaining savings

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.920
and bought this dumpling shop.

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:46.599
Fan Xiao helped her...

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.640
And how did he handle it in the end?

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:53.479
My brother loves to gamble.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.679
President Fan somehow
found out and set him up.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.119
He made him owe a lot of money.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.800
And take out high-interest loans.

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:01.880
In the end,

00:34:01.959 --> 00:34:03.199
He stepped in to mediate.

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:05.599
The condition was

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.239
They would never bother me again.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.040
I owe him thanks.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.639
But he said he was doing
a favor for the Bodhisattva.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.760
If anyone should be thanked, the
Bodhisattva should receive thanks, not him.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.239
Tiantian

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.879
Uncle's here to take you home.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.639
Mom

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.879
Where's mom?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
Mom

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.280
Mom went to pick stars for Tiantian.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.280
The place to pick stars is a bit far.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.040
It might take some time.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.840
From now on,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.800
Uncle will stay with you, okay?

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:00.639
Okay.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.679
Tiantian

00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:04.719
Show Uncle

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.160
Did you learn how to fold dumplings?

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:08.760
See if I folded them well.

00:35:08.959 --> 00:35:10.040
So good.

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:11.479
You're amazing.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.000
Look at your messy face!

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.399
Finally, they lived happily ever after.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.280
Alright, Tiantian.
Story's over.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320
Time to sleep.

00:35:22.399 --> 00:35:24.239
One more story.

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:26.678
Time to sleep.

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:28.399
Just the last one.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040
Okay.

00:35:32.919 --> 00:35:34.959
Guess how much I love you.

00:35:45.919 --> 00:35:47.199
What's wrong, Tiantian?

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:51.840
Uncle, what's written on this painting?

00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:54.879
This painting says...

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.679
"Fly side by side."

00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:00.000
What does “fly side by side” mean?

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.399
It means being together
with the one you love.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.639
Being with the person you like.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.520
Then are you and me “flying side by side”?

00:36:10.679 --> 00:36:12.280
Not that kind of “like.”

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.399
This seems to be

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.760
You and Jennie from kindergarten.

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:20.320
Then, Uncle,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.320
Do you have someone
to “fly side by side” with?

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:32.399
Tiantian

00:36:32.679 --> 00:36:33.919
Let's go play over there.

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:46.399
Hello

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.520
What medicine do you need?

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.135
Do you have stomach medicine?

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.080
I'll check it myself.

00:36:50.081 --> 00:36:51.879
It's on the back shelf, at the corner.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Thanks.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.120
Brother Fan.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.520
What brings you here today?

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840
I'm here to

00:37:14.919 --> 00:37:16.199
collect some research materials.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080
Want to eat?

00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:20.479
Thanks, Fan Xiao.
Wait for me to get it for you.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360
Okay.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:32.679
Fan Xiao
The materials.

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:34.120
Thank you
Fan Xiao

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.080
Are you thirsty?

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.640
Why don't you sit down for a bit?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.879
No need to sit.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.320
I'm in a hurry.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.879
I'll take this.

00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:22.600
Sir

00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:23.638
You have a subway card here.

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:24.840
Not a credit card.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.679
Sorry about that.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760
No problem.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.360
Here you go.
Thank you.

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:34.159
Yes

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:37.199
I forgot to take it.

00:39:04.919 --> 00:39:05.919
Hello

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.360
My name is Fan Xiao.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.639
I'm Thai-Hua.

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:11.719
You Shulang

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.159
Brother Fan

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.400
What did you forget to take?

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.360
Brother Fan

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120
Excuse me.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.560
Is something the matter?

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.120
You came to buy medicine.

00:39:44.879 --> 00:39:47.600
I work in sales at Kangda Pharma.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.639
You can try their medicine.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.399
Kangda's medicine

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.840
Expensive

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.040
Weak efficacy

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.679
Before, I wouldn't choose it.

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:07.679
And I won't choose it in the future.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.879
Not anymore.

00:40:38.399 --> 00:40:39.000
Tiantian
Slow down.

00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:41.239
Uncle, look at the red road.

00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:43.799
Where did this living Lei Feng come from?

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.639
He laid a road with red bricks!

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:47.576
A young guy worked
through the night in the rain.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.280
He worked through the rain half the night.

00:40:49.399 --> 00:40:50.478
My old man,

00:40:50.479 --> 00:40:51.239
When he offered him a cigarette,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.719
He asked if he was moving in.

00:40:52.879 --> 00:40:54.000
He said no.

00:40:54.399 --> 00:40:56.719
He likes someone living here.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.398
The rainwater was flooding.

00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:00.679
He was worried it would be hard for her
to get in and out.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.519
These red bricks are like a carpet.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.800
Of course.

00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:07.639
Probably for the girl on the sixth floor.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.120
She really is a beauty.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.839
The rain has been a lot lately.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.760
This will make it much
easier to get in and out.

00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:13.399
Tiantian

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600
Tiantian

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:15.719
Tiantian

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760
Stop playing.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.919
You'll be late for kindergarten.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.919
Uncle's going to eat with classmates later.

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:22.239
Be good, okay?

00:41:23.405 --> 00:41:25.326
Uncle, do you have classmates too?

00:41:25.479 --> 00:41:26.040
Yeah.

00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:27.399
You have classmates, Tiantian.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.760
Uncle has classmates too.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.480
I've eaten Western food for seven
or eight years abroad.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.680
You're still taking me out for Western food
after I come back from being abroad?

00:41:37.879 --> 00:41:38.879
Zhang Shicheng

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.840
Don't we still have some
bad blood between us?

00:41:42.479 --> 00:41:44.280
I dated three girls in college.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.480
And it's all because of you.

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:47.320
This grudge will last a lifetime.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.800
That's because your
love wasn't “gold-strong.”

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.959
Every time I dated, you ruined it.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.016
You seemed to have
“gold-strong” love for me.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.719
How come

00:41:55.919 --> 00:41:57.479
You disappeared for seven years abroad.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080
You Shulang

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.520
Zhang Shicheng is bullying your woman.

00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:04.159
Huihui.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280
This restaurant

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.679
Was opened by a French chef.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:08.199
I don't know if it's good.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.800
But it's famous for being expensive.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.879
Today

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.840
Let me help you bring him to bankruptcy.

00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:14.000
Huihui

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:15.455
If you don't want to eat Western food,

00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:16.199
There's a decent place.

00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:17.639
A new Southeast Asian restaurant.

00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:19.040
This is good.

00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:20.279
The décor has an exotic feel.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:20.840
I like it.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.040
Let's go, let's go.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040
You Shulang

00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:52.639
Hmm

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.679
Why are you spacing out?
Look at the menu.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.399
What do you want to eat?
Hmm

00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:58.719
Waiter

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:00.840
Do you have any recommendations?

00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:06.959
The chef's special for today is

00:43:07.479 --> 00:43:08.600
Yellow curry beef brisket.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360
Hey, Huihui,

00:43:25.919 --> 00:43:27.800
At least your ex is here.

00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:30.959
You don't have to be so obvious
when staring at handsome guys.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.159
You two

00:43:33.879 --> 00:43:35.040
know each other?

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.239
We do.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280
He's my ex.

00:43:58.679 --> 00:44:00.158
In the crowd

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:03.719
I was spotted in an instant

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.238
The desolation in your eyes

00:44:07.239 --> 00:44:10.398
Hiding the same fire inside

00:44:10.399 --> 00:44:13.079
No need for words

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.399
No need to ask what's right or wrong

00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:18.918
The moment we drew close

00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:21.639
The outcome was already destined

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.320
Is the moth drawn to the light

00:44:33.159 --> 00:44:35.679
Or the whale sinking into the deep

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.799
With nothing but solitary courage

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.360
I wager it all on tomorrow

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.359
The walls of the world

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.639
What does it matter if I break them down

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.079
My chest burns with heat

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.280
Screaming only for you

00:44:54.439 --> 00:44:57.079
I'll love you until it boils over

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.360
Loving without a care for the world

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.119
Like two stars

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.120
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.320
Even if it's just for a moment

00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:05.918
It's more than enough to surpass forever

00:45:05.919 --> 00:45:07.198
Hate and love both burn brightly

00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:09.878
Loving until the sky falls dark

00:45:09.879 --> 00:45:11.840
Loving until we reach the end of the road

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.638
Before the altar

00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:15.759
We burn all the incense

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.839
Not asking for the next life

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.359
Only desiring this moment

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.559
Drowning together with you in

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.800
This blazing fire of fate
