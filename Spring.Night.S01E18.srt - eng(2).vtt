00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640
After the palace exam ends,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.120
His Majesty will announce

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.720
that the child in my womb

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is the royal heir.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.680
Aren't you happy?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.480
What if the child

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.440
isn't a boy?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.080
What if it's a girl?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.920
You really know how to ruin my mood.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.680
I'm very angry.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.480
Don't talk back to me anymore.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.720
Ye Wuming,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.800
I can't let you take this risk.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.920
What are you doing?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.920
Untie me.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.040
Mai Tian!

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.400
Mai Tian, untie me!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.280
What risk? Come back!

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.680
Mai Tian!

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.400
Come back, Mai Tian!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.440
(You always protected me before.)

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.800
(Now, it's my turn.)

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.160
Mai Tian!

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.160
I suppose

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.080
this must be the top scorer, right?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.640
Steady as a mountain.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.160
Like he's in deep meditation.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200
It seems he has a well-thought-out plan.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.480
I doubt it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.800
He just wants to do something outrageous

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.000
to show off.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.880
Despite severe illness, His Majesty
presided over the palace exam,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.800
screened by gauze to uphold his dignity.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.880
Such dedication

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360
is truly a blessing
for scholars everywhere.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.800
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.760
His Majesty is still in the hall.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.480
How can we whisper
amongst ourselves here?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.200
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.160
Look! He's writing now.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.920
This...

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.600
It's written in blood!

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.320
To uphold conscience.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.120
To stand for the people.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.760
To preserve the wisdom of past sages.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.000
To secure peace for all generations.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.240
Your Majesty!

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.080
I, Ye Wuming,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.880
beseeches you to investigate unfairness
in the imperial exam.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.080
Ye Wuming?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.880
Hurry!

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.040
Mai Tian went in my stead.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.880
She's in danger.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.120
Such insolence!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.840
A mere juren scholar

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880
not yet ranked,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.480
dares to spout such nonsense,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.480
railing against the grand
talent selection.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.280
Outrageous!

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.680
Official posts are frequently sold
in Jiangnan.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.080
Most officials serving at court today

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.200
are proteges

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.680
cultivated by you, Prime Minister.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.120
Your Majesty, please investigate.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.160
Grant justice to scholars
who yearn to serve

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400
but find no path
into government service.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.680
All current officials

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.360
were educated

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.680
by the Imperial Academy

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.280
and these veteran academicians.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.080
They have nothing to do with me!

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.280
Someone!

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.680
Drag him out!

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.080
Let me go!

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.280
Go!

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.200
Go!

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.480
Zhifeng, what are you doing?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800
Why did you bring him here?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.880
I left him at home

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.800
to come in his place.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.680
Listen to me.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.400
Some things

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.880
must be done by him personally.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.880
Why?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.560
You'll understand soon.

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:25.920
Zhifeng!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.800
It's you?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.200
You...

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.440
(He's actually alive?)

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.640
I, Ye Wuming,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.680
presume to intrude here.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720
My crime deserves death.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.920
Your Majesty, please

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.320
investigate the exam corruption.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.240
Rebellion.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.040
This is rebellion!

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.080
Someone!

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.240
Drag him out!

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.160
Stop!

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.400
Your Majesty,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.640
investigate the exam corruption

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.440
and uphold justice for all scholars!

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.520
My son...

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320
Look up.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.400
Your Majesty?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.520
Raise your head.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720
Jin Chuan?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.360
My son!

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.760
Your Majesty,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.520
I come from Penglai Village.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520
My name is Ye Wuming.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.920
I am not the Crown Prince.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.720
I only ask you

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.000
to investigate the exam fraud.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.920
You are my Crown Prince!

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120
How could this be wrong?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.800
His Majesty is delirious.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.640
Escort him back to his chambers, now!

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.920
Your Majesty!

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.360
My son Jin Chuan is still alive!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.160
He's back!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.040
He's back!

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.200
What?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.160
The Crown Prince is back?

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.960
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.040
You didn't kill the Crown Prince?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.120
No.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.880
I personally escorted him

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.440
to the palace hall to meet His Majesty.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.120
You dare betray me?

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.920
I haven't!

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.600
I did it to protect you.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.360
Protect me?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.320
The Crown Prince is back.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.440
We'll all be executed!

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.920
Even if he hadn't returned,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.320
the Prime Minister would still kill you.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560
He wants the throne for himself.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.000
Can't you see that?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600
Come with me.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.080
Let's go

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.840
somewhere nobody knows us.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.440
Have our baby there.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.320
Raise our child together.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.520
Do you truly

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.600
refuse to come with me?

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120
Go with you?

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.800
What can you offer me?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.840
To remain Crown Princess,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.440
enjoying boundless wealth

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.960
and having everything,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.520
or to wander the world with you,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.920
living hand to mouth?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.120
What should I do?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.920
It's obvious.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.320
Is it that I don't understand?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.600
Or that you don't understand?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.760
But the Crown Prince doesn't love you.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.240
And you don't love him either.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.000
Love?

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.640
Is it important?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.760
I'm afraid the Crown Prince
will hurt you.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.560
He has lost his memory.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.520
He doesn't remember how bad

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.920
things were between us before.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.840
On the contrary,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.760
I can use him.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.680
Yes.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.440
That's right.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.240
I didn't expect

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.120
that you didn't kill him,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.960
yet left me a way out.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.400
What if I tell him the truth?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.920
Don't be foolish.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.400
Our goals are the same.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.760
Now,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.200
you only have

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.560
two choices.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.560
Either

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.920
help me,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.720
or

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.320
kill me.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.520
Then just help me.
