00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480
Mom, don't worry.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.960
I've found the best doctors.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You'll be fine.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480
It's all my fault.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
If I hadn't asked you for that money,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.120
Mom wouldn't be in the hospital now.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.330
What are you saying?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.570
You quit school at 16 to support my education.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.660
If it weren't for your sacrifice,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.740
I wouldn't be where I am today.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
Not just 200,000,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.440
I should even buy you a house.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.200
Yangzi.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.519
Sis.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.660
Xiaoxiao is an only child.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.640
She's never experienced hardship,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.410
so she can't understand our sibling bond.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.450
I apologize on Xiaoxiao's behalf.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.440
Yangzi.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.960
After Mom recovers,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.200
I'll take her to live with me.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
We won't disturb your life anymore.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.000
Sis, you...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.440
Yangzi, listen to me.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.900
Mom and I just want you to be happy.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.320
Live well.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.259
After Mom leaves the hospital...

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380
He walked with a limp until his death.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.759
This incident

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.940
was a burden weighing on Xiangyang's heart.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.010
He couldn't forgive Xiaoxiao.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.400
Later on,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.300
I also heard about what happened that night.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.740
Leng Xiaoxiao claimed Xiangyang brutally hurt her

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820
and would be indebted to her for life.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.040
The Leng family

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.320
always looked down on us

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.760
and constantly humiliated him.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.200
After that,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.960
Old Mr. Leng passed away.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.130
Then they got divorced.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320
I understand now.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.760
I know you're a big star,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.880
but you're different from Xiaoxiao.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.079
You're not arrogant,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.100
you're good to Xiangyang,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.320
and Xiangyang loves you too.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.640
I hope you two can stay together.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.680
Why were you gone so long?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.200
I just met with your sister

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.570
and talked with her for a while.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.560
She told me about your mother.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.640
I know

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.570
it was because of that car accident

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.120
that you hurt Xiaoxiao

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.040
and that's why she has

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.360
that rose on her ankle,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.920
right?

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.820
Xiangyang,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.280
tell me.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.090
I really want to know the truth.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.280
Fine.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
What's the point?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.920
Making all this money

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.420
but can't even take care of my mom.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.200
To hell with being a rich family's son-in-law.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.460
I've lost all dignity.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.730
Hurry up,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
go back to your own home.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.680
Don't scare our residents here.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.940
I am a resident too.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.960
You?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.290
Can you afford a place here?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.800
I'm sorry.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.680
I apologize, I apologize.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.920
I didn't see clearly.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.120
I'm really sorry.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.130
Here's your key.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.330
I'm so sorry.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.180
Don't touch me.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.840
Is this my home?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.420
How many times have I told you?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.360
Don't come back when you're drunk.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.000
Get out.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.760
What?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.160
Are you my wife or not?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.000
Get lost.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.920
Do you know how you're acting today?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920
It's disgusting.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.640
Get out.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.500
What are you doing?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.560
Get out.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.960
You...

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.080
Don't...

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.080
Why did you treat my mother like that?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.610
Get lost.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720
Get up. Why did you say those things?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.250
Are you still my wife or not?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.480
I don't want to talk to you.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.400
Get out of here.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.200
You...

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.840
Don't touch me.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.480
I know.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.320
Leng Xiaoxiao has been using

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.920
the second half of this story

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.140
to spread everywhere.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.400
Saying I'm worse than an animal.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.280
Saying I raped her.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.290
I don't want to explain.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.320
I did hurt her.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.440
So I deserve to be cursed.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.620
To be despised.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.720
But you were hurt too.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.920
Auntie was hurt too.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.880
Xiangyang.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.360
I understand you.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.810
But I can't forgive myself.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.200
No matter what I do,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.440
nothing justifies hurting her.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.060
Xiangyang.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.580
Forgive yourself.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.120
Xiaoxiao.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.340
I know the story about the rose tattoo on your ankle.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.760
I already know.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120
I understand you.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.820
But I also understand Xiangyang.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.880
So?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.600
Let go.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200
Leave this place.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.370
Start everything over.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You want to run off with Xiangyang, don't you?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.680
Xuanxuan.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.640
We've all experienced

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.370
the pain of losing everything.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.850
Our home is gone.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.220
Our faces changed.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.840
But what belongs to us

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.720
must be taken back.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.760
Everything you have now belongs to Xiangyang.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.140
You're wearing Ye Zhiqiu's face.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.120
Xiangyang loves Ye Zhiqiu.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.100
Do you remember

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.450
Hong Ming's cooperation with Xiangyang?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.220
I was the first one to stand up against it.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.010
Hong Ming was the Leng family's supplier.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.280
This relationship is too sensitive.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.210
Being tied together would easily invite criticism.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.090
But guess what Xiangyang said?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.240
Business is like a battlefield.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.610
It's always been a matter of survival.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.440
Xuanxuan,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.400
just listen to his values.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.120
This is our situation now.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.770
Back then, Hong Ming

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.740
had high hopes for Xiangyang.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.840
None of us knows

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.970
why things went so wrong between Xiangyang and your family.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.040
Xuanxuan,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.050
my father never blamed me until his dying breath.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.000
But I failed him.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.440
I chose the wrong man

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.770
and it angered him to death.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.040
Zhiqiu is back.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.180
Thank you, sir.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.610
You're welcome.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.400
Xiaoxiao.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.480
Xiaoxiao.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.520
Xiaoxiao.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.720
Xiaoxiao.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.340
Hey, Xiaoxiao,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.400
where are you?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.240
Xuanxuan.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.200
I haven't had

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.050
a full night's sleep in months.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.040
I have no life of my own.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.760
I'm just your backup,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
your substitute,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.480
your protector.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.040
I'll do everything I can to keep you safe.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.360
Even if someday

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.680
I die.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.000
Xiaoxiao.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.160
Xuanxuan.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.580
I'm glad you're happy.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.200
I'm happy for you.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.560
But I want to go home too.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080
I want to rest.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.040
I want to feel the sun.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.520
I want to go shopping.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.920
I want to be around people.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.400
I want to be myself again.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.520
I'm so tired,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.930
I can barely keep going.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.680
Xuanxuan,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840
help me.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.360
Ma'am.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.360
Who delivered this?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.360
Nobody delivered anything.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.920
No one.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.400
Didn't you come back earlier

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.240
and then leave again?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.360
And we haven't had any visitors today.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.480
Hey,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.840
Xiaoxiao.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.720
How long are you going to push me?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.080
Xuanxuan.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.440
That bottle represents our fate.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.920
All of this

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.960
is your choice.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.720
Why?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.200
Why?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.370
I only want to atone for my sins.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720
Hong Ming is gone.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.090
I want to pay off Yuxuan's debt,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.330
but she won't even give me that chance.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.360
You have Ye Zhiqiu's face.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.000
Xiangyang loves Ye Zhiqiu.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:01.880
Mr. Zhang.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.770
Are you at the hospital?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.600
I'm in the ward

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.560
with Mr. Xiang.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.360
Okay.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.300
I'll pack my things and come over.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.760
Wait for me to arrive before you leave.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.930
Don't worry.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.280
I'm here.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.960
Nothing will happen.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.800
Why did you trust him

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.920
and betray me?

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.160
I trusted you,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.240
and this is what I get.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.720
The result of my trust

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.680
is this.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.160
You betrayed me.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:09.920
Xuanxuan.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.360
Xuanxuan.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.760
Let's meet one last time.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.160
The same wine.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Just like the one on September 20th,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200
exactly the same.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.540
If only time could flow backward,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.200
wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.520
In this world,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.530
there are no 'what ifs.'

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.160
If I could live again,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.800
I'd rather go back to the day Hong Ming died.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040
I don't want to go back

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.040
to the day I met Ye Zhiqiu.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.440
I just want

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.560
to see my father one last time.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.720
Xiaoxiao.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.320
We both regret it now, don't we?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.640
The truth

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.960
will definitely be discovered.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.210
Let's just let it go.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.520
Letting Xiangyang go

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.800
is also setting ourselves free.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.200
Free ourselves.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.280
Then tell me,

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.000
if Xiangyang knew

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.760
that you killed his true love with your own hands,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.760
do you think he would still love you?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.360
I gave up that hope long ago.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.920
I just want to end all of this now.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.640
I want to be Xie Yuxuan again.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.220
Are you going to turn yourself in?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.280
Under which identity?

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.040
Let's go together.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.520
Let's go to Korea to find ourselves.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.080
Find a place where nobody knows us

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:53.800
and start a new life.
