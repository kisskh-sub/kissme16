00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:38.640
Come on.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:40.560
This glass

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.159
is to celebrate Mr. Wen Pei'an's

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:43.679
modeling career

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:44.640
debut

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.759
being a complete success.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.240
Bottoms up.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.840
This second glass

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.040
celebrates the two of us

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.879
for today's performance

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.959
being a total victory.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.120
At the time, I thought

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.599
with our acting skills,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.159
we could've starred in *Lurk*.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.400
You're way too slow.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.640
This third glass...

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.319
This is liquor,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.239
not water.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.719
Of course I know it's liquor.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.840
Me,

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.200
I have a high tolerance.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.040
If you can't handle it,

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.480
just drink less.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.879
I can tell you can't handle it.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.680
You know what?

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.960
Actually,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.120
I do have a boyfriend.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.639
Really?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.039
How come you've never mentioned him?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.319
Cash.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.680
Cash is my boyfriend.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.120
You know what?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960
Actually,

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.439
I'm really, really envious of you.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.800
I envy that you have

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.560
parents who love you so much.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.560
Your parents don't love you?

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.120
Probably not.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.280
Because

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.120
I've never even seen them.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.319
To be precise,

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:11.159
it's that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.240
the moment I was born,

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.520
they abandoned me.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.639
I grew up in an orphanage.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.319
When I was little,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.800
I'd see those kids

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.360
being taken out by their parents,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.919
going out to play.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.039
They got tasty food

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.360
and wore pretty clothes.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.319
You have no idea how much I envied them.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.080
So,

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.960
when I was seven years old,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.719
I thought I did

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.919
something incredibly brave.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.360
I ran away from the orphanage.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.800
I wanted to go out

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.199
and find my

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560
mom and dad.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.039
Hey, kid.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.919
Why are you alone?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.840
Mister,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280
could you buy me a bun?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.360
I'm hungry.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.879
Sure.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.120
I'll treat you.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.800
Why are you here by yourself?

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.279
My parents are coming to pick me up soon.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.560
What about you?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480
I ran away from home on purpose.

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.199
Be gone for two hours,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.279
show my parents who's boss.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.680
You should go home.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.680
You'll miss them.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.000
I won't miss them at all.

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.079
Will you miss yours?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.600
It's about time.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
I should head home.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.720
You should go home early too.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.759
Of course, the result was obvious.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.439
I didn't find them.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.920
Because I had no idea

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.439
what they even looked like.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.600
Don't look at me with such pity.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.160
Personally, I feel

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800
my childhood

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:37.759
was actually quite happy.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.240
Let me tell you,

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.800
I'm not bragging,

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.160
but I'm someone

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.399
who's very smart.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.360
No matter what I learn,

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.120
as long as

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.160
I see it three times,

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.480
I can master it.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.279
Do you believe me?

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.279
I believe you.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.319
You don't believe me?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.040
In today's society,

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.720
educational background is highly valued.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.399
For someone like me,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.720
with a low level of education,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.680
it's really hard

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.000
to get by in this world.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.560
Can you understand?

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.040
I can understand.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.399
If you were to say

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.000
you can't understand,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.560
but even if you don't,

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.279
that's okay too.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.720
But honestly,

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.399
I'm very grateful

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.160
that my current company

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.120
doesn't care about my education.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.439
But recently,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.600
our company

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.519
got a new bastard in charge.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.079
That

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.120
bas-

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.399
tard.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.680
Let me tell you,

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.639
this bastard,

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.519
as soon as he took over,

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.040
he destroyed

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.480
all the proposals

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.160
I worked so hard on.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.040
What the hell does he know?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.600
Such a great company...

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.279
I'm really worried

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.439
that as soon as he took over,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.800
he'd ruin this company.

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:11.600
Have you ever considered

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.040
that this situation

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.000
might be viewed differently by everyone?

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.600
Impossible.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.839
Let me ask you,

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:24.199
what is the

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.519
fundamental rule

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.319
for a boyfriend?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.639
It's that

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.079
whoever the girlfriend

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.959
curses at,

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.759
the boyfriend must curse at too.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:32.879
Come on, come on, come on.

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:33.680
Curse with me.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.120
My boss

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.120
is a

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.279
stupid little bastard.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:41.920
Your boss

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.160
is a stupid little bastard.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.879
That's not good enough.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:47.519
You have to be louder.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.879
Come on.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:49.360
With me,

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:50.759
shout it out loud!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.000
MY BOSS

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.439
IS A

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.959
STUPID

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.120
LITTLE BASTARD!

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.720
YOUR BOSS

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.199
IS A

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.759
STUPID

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.360
LITTLE BASTARD!

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:16.519
He is a stupid little bastard!

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.680
Xin Tong!

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.759
Darn it, Wen Pei'an!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.720
You're a beast!

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.279
Wen Pei'an!

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.799
Wen Pei'an!

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.200
Tell me,

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.440
what did you do

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.320
to me last night?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.320
I didn't do anything.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.240
I demand

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.200
to see the rooftop surveillance from last night.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.120
No.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.320
You have no right to see it.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.799
Fine.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.120
If you won't show me,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.159
you must have a guilty conscience.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.519
I could choose to call the police.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.440
I can use the power of the law

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.320
to punish you.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:39.600
I'm sorry.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.159
It's okay.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.159
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:43.360
I really didn't mean to.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.320
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.399
Let me wash your clothes.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.440
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.519
I must wash them for you.

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.639
I have to take responsibility.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.200
You...

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.000
Give me a chance.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.840
I'll wash them clean for you.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.159
I'll definitely wash them clean.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.360
Give them here!

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:00.039
You...

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.720
wait here for me.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.600
Don't worry, I'll definitely wash them clean.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.240
Go over there and wait.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.000
It'll be quick.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.039
Wait here for me.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.519
Xin Tong!

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.320
Xin Tong!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.360
I'll be quick!

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.200
Wait for me!

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.080
Wait for me!

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.679
Xin Tong, give my clothes back!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.399
Xin Tong!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.759
Xin Tong!

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.159
Right.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.080
I'm sorry.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.600
Is that enough?

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.679
I'm so sorry.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.320
I'm truly sorry.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.200
I'm not usually like this when I drink.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.600
After I wash these clothes clean,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.480
I'll return them to you.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:02.440
I advise you

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.559
to quit drinking from now on.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.879
I swear,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.360
I won't drink anymore.

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:12.440
That outfit you're wearing

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.000
is very stylish.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:18.759
Hello?

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:19.200
What's up?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.399
This morning, our marketing department

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.159
has a meeting with President Galileo.

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:23.240
Darn it, I forgot!

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:24.240
I'm on my way right now!

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.279
I know, I know.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:30.159
Remember to take your medicine.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.279
Be right there.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:48.679
Do you need a ride?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.879
Is that okay?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.720
Where are you going?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.879
