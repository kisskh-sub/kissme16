00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.400
Say the legal representative's
name out loud.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.000
Let him know.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.630
Qin Taoyi!

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.080
Rebelling, huh?

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.000
-Rebels all look like this.
-Jiangyong.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Our logistics company
is officially registered now.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.630
We can start operations tomorrow.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.150
Time to get to work.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.080
I decide when we start working.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.670
Let's start.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.080
What?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.550
So you're hitting the boss now?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.510
Pretty tough, aren't you?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:29.960
Okay.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.510
Tianye.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.250
You're playing a dangerous game.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.480
I've got your brother now.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.620
Did you hear that?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.060
Then bring the gold bars.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.760
Come alone.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.070
What's wrong?

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.240
Just a prank call.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.700
I need to step out for a bit.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.960
Why's he leaving?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.030
Isn't he eating?

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.950
Jiangyong.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.550
I heard something strange

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.360
on the phone.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.840
Captain Zhong, Luo Bo must have fled.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.220
I'm not so sure.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.500
Knowing Luo Bo's personality,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.630
Hanzhou won't be peaceful for a while.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.360
Liu.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.320
Yes?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.360
Has the border check been initiated?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.020
Yes, it has.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.630
Also,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.060
we need to check
those surveillance cameras

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.600
at the intersections near the Rome Hotel

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.670
as soon as possible.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.200
Yes, sir.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.110
Bian Jing.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.240
The stations, docks, and airport—

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.530
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.530
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.130
have you stationed people there?

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.510
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.360
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.020
Yes, I have.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.880
Feng isn't answering his phone.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.720
I'll send him a message.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.780
Send him a message.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.870
Feng.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.550
Something might have happened.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.710
We're secretly following Tianye.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.510
Call back ASAP.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:28.930
[Send]

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.630
Jiangyong, you don't think

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.400
anything will go wrong, right?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.570
No, it won't.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.860
Stay on him.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.520
Tianfei.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.080
Tianfei.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.790
Tianye.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.000
Tianye!

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.860
Tianye!

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:06.870
Tianye!

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.440
I'm fine.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.310
Where's my money?

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.790
Let him go

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.530
and I'll give you the money right away.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.550
Back then,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.820
Mr. Ma told me

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.720
that you are excellent.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.160
I didn't believe it before.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.840
Now I realize

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.900
he is indeed excellent.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.670
Tianye!

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.540
Luo Bo!

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.550
Luo Bo!

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.440
Tianye!

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.180
Luo Bo!

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.390
Luo Bo.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.050
If you're man enough,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.240
untie me

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.150
and let's fight one-on-one!

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.120
Let me go!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.600
Don't worry,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.750
your turn is coming.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.530
Let go!

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.580
Did you think

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.000
sending your brother to spy on me

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.350
was so clever

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.220
that you'd definitely win?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.460
Did you ever imagine this day would come?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.670
Don't you want the money?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.680
I'll give you all the money.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.950
Just let us go.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.640
This isn't about money anymore.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.320
I don't need money.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.110
I'm a wanted man now.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.860
Before I leave,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.210
taking a few people down with me

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.400
would make me happy.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.890
You two brothers

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.880
can go to hell

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.440
and wait for me there.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.320
Tianye, let's go!

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.150
Come on, let's go!

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.830
Stop fighting!

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.190
Tianye!

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.000
Run!

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.720
Hurry!

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.350
Be gentle.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.310
My arm is broken.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.310
Police!

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.340
Stop fighting!

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.980
Get him!

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.640
Tianye,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.470
let's go!

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.230
Hurry up!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.200
Get in the car, quick!

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.210
Jiangyong!

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.920
Tianfei, let's go!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.660
Jiangyong!

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.880
Jiangyong, don't fall asleep!

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.440
Jiangyong!

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.030
Jiangyong, wake up!

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.760
Don't sleep!

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.900
Stay awake!

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.160
Tianfei, press on it!

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.560
Press!

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.480
Press harder, keep pressure on it!

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.070
Tianye, where's the towel?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.530
Tianye.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.880
Get me another towel from the front!

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.350
Get another one!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.150
-Hurry.
-Yes.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.880
Tianye!

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.580
Tianye!

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.920
Tianye!

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.700
Tianye!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.240
Taoyi,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.640
hand me the towel, quick!

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.530
Jiangyong!

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.810
Jiangyong, wake up!

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.110
Don't sleep, Jiangyong.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.770
Stay awake.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.970
Jiangyong.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.060
It's a bit cold.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.800
Jiangyong.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.690
Tianfei.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.220
Are you okay?

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.870
I'm fine, Jiangyong.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.640
I'm okay.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.280
Where's Tianye?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.850
Tianye.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.530
Tianye.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.480
Tianye.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.590
Wake up, Tianye.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.220
Tianye.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.790
Tianye.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.120
Say something, Tianye.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.310
It's okay.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.810
Jiangyong, he's fine.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.540
It's okay.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.540
Crazy.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.280
Keep them under control.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:04.900
No more fighting.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.930
I know.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.110
I'll watch them, Jiangyong.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.920
Don't worry.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.960
Where are we going now?

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.280
To the hospital.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.030
No.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.650
Home.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.360
Home.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.540
Okay.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.830
Home.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.070
Let's go home.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.400
Taoyi.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.860
Hurry up.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.640
Hurry up.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.530
Jiangyong.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.380
Jiangyong.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.660
Jiangyong.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.630
Jiangyong!

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.720
Jiangyong, hang in there.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.850
Wake up, Jiangyong!

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.110
Jiangyong,

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.160
say something to us.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.820
Jiangyong!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.200
Say something, Jiangyong!

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.860
Jiangyong.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.200
Hurry up!

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.280
My condolences.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.400
Xiaobo.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880
These clothes...

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.670
Don't they fit properly?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.400
Mom.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.620
Let me do it.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.720
No need.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.750
I've heard that

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.130
these clothes should fit properly

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.310
to look presentable.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.180
Give them to me.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.730
Mom.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.720
It was only later,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.510
you felt guilty

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.040
that you started
helping me with some matters.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.190
It was just getting me some information,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.290
and I still paid you 200,000.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.880
You said you owed me.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.070
I haven't seen you return

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.130
that 200,000 to me.

I haven't heard you
complain about losing sleep.

Fine.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.960

they're watching me now.

And you still want me to push forward.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.830
If something happens to me,

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.880
it won't be good for either of us.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.440
Can we just leave

Even if you take care of him,

what good will it do?

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.720
You have too many holes

Getting out safely now

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.550
It's not that I want to leave the ship.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.550
It's your ship that's

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.260
not sailing steady anymore.

Okay?

Let me tell you something.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.110
This ship

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.650
is nowhere near its destination.

You want to leave? Fine.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.440
Your only option is to jump into the sea.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.030
Even if you're not afraid,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.480
you can't let your wife and children

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.020

What honor do I owe you?

Why are you glaring at me?

Talk about honor with you?
