of the same title.)

(Rain Manor)

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.680
Your wound isn't a huge issue.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.280
You'll be fine after
getting a suture in the hospital.

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.280
Thank you.
We're lucky that you're around.

00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:57.040
Thank you so much.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.920
Don't mention it.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.519
Everyone, we're truly sorry

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.480
that something upsetting had happened.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.480
Please don't hold it against us.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.599
The envelope beside you all

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.560
is the reward Master
had prepared for you all.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.400
According to him,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.039
winning or losing doesn't matter.

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.555
Participation is the most important.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.340
(Mr. Pan Jingting,
10,000 silver dollars)

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.319
Yu.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.000
I can't accept this reward.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.800
Elder Yu,

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:34.840
we can't accept the reward either.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.000
That's right.

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.400
We attended the banquet

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.120
in order to visit you

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.000
and check how you were doing.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.280
As your junior,

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.749
having been three years away from you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.488
is already considered
irresponsible of us.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.199
We mustn't accept your rewards now.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.840
Are you guys

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.960
belittling me?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.240
Godfather,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.280
I came here initially

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.759
to visit both you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.199
and Xiuyun.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.800
Xiuyun's death anniversary is nearing.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.639
Why don't I arrange a car
for us to visit her together?

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.280
I should do the arrangement.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.319
We'll join as well.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.520
All of us will be going.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.360
It seems you all

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.759
still remember Xiuyun.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm truly moved.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.960
I'm content now.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.800
All right.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.199
By then,

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.599
let us

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.319
visit her grave together.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.000
I've indeed blamed you guys

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.599
for Xiuyun's death before.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.680
I've also blamed myself for it.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.199
However,

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.879
it's pointless to do so.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.800
I pride myself

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:54.910
on having some knowledge about antiques

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.560
and spending
my entire life studying them.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.240
But I lack the broad-mindedness
of our predecessors.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.000
I just can't bring myself to be humble.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.800
I'm ashamed of myself.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.560
Those of us who are still alive

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.759
should live on.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.040
It's not just for our sake.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.759
It also represents Xiuyun's hope.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.000
I suppose

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.079
my actions

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.879
had intimidated you all last night.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.759
I...

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:31.879
Here,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.199
I would like to

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.399
apologize to you all sincerely.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:40.920
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.800
I feel exhausted.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Everyone,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.279
if you have something else to do,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.079
please proceed on your own.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.120
Please pardon me
for not being able to see you off.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.000
For this match,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.720
you're the winner.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.279
I will keep my promise.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.759
The Liubo Chess set

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.079
is yours now.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.560
Thank you, Elder Yu.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.199
(Rain Manor)

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.480
Here, slowly.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.629
From tomorrow onward,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.620
I'll devote my effort to training those
who will participate in the contest.

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.319
As for the martial arts center,
I'll leave it to you entirely.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.759
Brother,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.519
I'm afraid I can't handle it myself.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.160
Before this, I was training our students

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.040
and managing our business
at the same time.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:00.311
I was spread too thin
to manage everything.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.480
You were good at studying
from a young age.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.120
You're smarter than me.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.879
I should've left you in charge

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.800
of our business long ago.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.439
Chi,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.319
I'll be depending on you in the future.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:15.839
Brother...

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.480
Let's go.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:19.759
Come.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.000
Slowly.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.844
(Rain Manor)

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.000
Slowly.

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.439
Let's go.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.399
Let's go.

00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:41.830
For your performance next Tuesday,

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:43.577
I'll head there together with you.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.000
In the next few days,

00:06:48.044 --> 00:06:50.080
I'll hold a discussion
with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:52.260
I'll tell them about
the machines you intend to buy.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.319
Father...

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.160
It's just a discussion.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.720
It might not necessarily work out.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.519
I'll try my best to persuade them.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.360
Thank you.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.120
Thank you, Father.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.079
We need to walk quite a distance.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:25.319
Can you do it?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.500
(Rain Manor)

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.740
(One Month Later)

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.340
(Grave of Yu Xiuyun)

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:34.840
Everyone, thank you

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.080
for visiting Xiuyun
together with me today.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.639
Thank you.

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.679
Yu,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.519
your car isn't here.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.000
Let me send you back.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.240
No need for that.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240
The car Ning had arranged for
is waiting for me down the hill.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.759
Thank you so much.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:12.840
Master?

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:16.559
Master.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.879
I'm Cao A'ning.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.559
I'm truly sorry

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.600
that I'm only here now.

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:22.919
You're Cao A'ning?

00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:23.630
That's right.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.480
Butler Li introduced me to you.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:26.840
Butler Li is my uncle.

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:29.320
I'm truly sorry about this.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.399
My ID card was stolen
on my way to your manor.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.720
That's why my trip was delayed.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.919
I've already notified my uncle
at the first time.

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.888
I'll definitely
pay more attention next time.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.720
If so,

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:44.720
the previous Miss Ning...

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.360
Who was she?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.000
Look.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.600
This bow alone has several variations.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.919
Where did we get these?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.320
Mr. Chu went to great pains
to find them for us.

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:19.622
And look at how beautiful
this feathered shuttlecock is.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.879
It's been so long

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:24.759
since Luoxia Manor was this lively.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.840
But

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.279
we still don't know which guest
Market Lord is expecting.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.799
Let's hurry.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.120
Chu Qiu,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.279
how long have we waited?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.120
There's no concept of time
in Tianguang Market.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.480
None of us knew how long we'd waited.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.279
Say,

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:58.440
when Butler Su and Bizhi arrive later,

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:01.360
how should I scold them
to make it seem more justified?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.679
Market Lord,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.479
the rice dumplings stick to your teeth.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.390
It'll cause indigestion
if you consume too much of it.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.488
You should stop eating it.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.159
What do you know?

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.440
I just want to have
a proper celebration.

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:17.800
It doesn't matter
even if it's the Cold Food Festival.

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.240
But in the end,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.559
someone stood me up.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:23.720
This is ridiculous!

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.759
How dare they stand me up?

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:30.840
Market Lord, since you want
to have a proper celebration,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.399
you should follow me.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.000
Where are we going?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.360
Just follow me.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.480
Where are we going?

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.799
Don't open your eyes first.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.080
Mind your steps.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.360
Mind your steps.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.919
Are we there yet?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.039
We'll arrive soon.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:58.159
Here we are.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.759
May I open my eyes now?

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.200
You may.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.360
Why did you bring me here?

00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:05.790
What's so special about this?

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.360
Isn't this the Forgetting Tree?

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.759
A swing?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.080
Did you make this for me?

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:23.120
Did you actually commit it to heart
when I said I had fun on a swing

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.666
together with my parents in my dream?

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.933
People do play with swings
during Cold Food Festival as well.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:29.320
You're the best.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.879
Come here.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.320
Give me a push.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.960
Go ahead.

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:47.720
Higher.

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.840
Say,

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:52.840
why didn't they come?

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:54.840
Perhaps something cropped up.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.480
What did you say?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.440
Perhaps

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.679
something cropped up.

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:01.559
Wrong.

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.440
Let me tell you why.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:04.639
It's because

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.759
Bizhi only has one item left

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:09.720
that he needs to collect.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.000
Doctor!

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.240
Follow me!

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.480
Please save him!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.279
Come with me.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:37.639
Hurry!

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:44.639
(In this era,)

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.399
(although humans remain helpless)

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:48.799
(against illness and death,)

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.679
(at least)

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.320
(everyone is trying their best to live.)

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.840
(Where life goes,)

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.200
(death follows.)

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.639
(If we meet someone,)

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.960
(that means we'll part ways)

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.240
(eventually.)

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.519
(Is it time for me to leave?)

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.440
(But I'm not ready yet.)

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.559
Don't move.

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:13.399
Don't move.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:15.120
Don't move!

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:20.240
All done.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.000
Get up.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.022
Your wound is healing quite nicely.

00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:24.720
Although the stitches have been removed,

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:27.159
keep the wound dry
for the next couple of days.

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:28.670
Don't pull on it too hard either.

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:30.320
Avoid spicy food.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.399
I know that.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.369
I was one of your peers.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.320
I used to be in charge
of removing stitches myself.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.480
You possess excellent skills.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.860
Which hospital did you work at before?

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:37.600
Chongle Hospital.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.960
I've never heard of that name before.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.440
It's a pet hospital after all.

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:41.000
See you.

00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:49.000
Boss!

00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:51.800
How are you?

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:52.670
I've fully recovered.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.622
It's a shame that they didn't
get rid of your foolishness.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.600
Let's go.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.639
But, Boss, you see,

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.120
it's more convenient for us
after the stitches are removed,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.977
unlike dogs and cats.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.080
They love to lick their wound
after the stitches have been removed.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.720
And, if you give them
an Elizabeth collar,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.840
they'll turn into a trumpet.

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:09.440
Do you want one, then?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.444
If you give me one,
I'll give you one in return.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.000
Another year has passed.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:17.120
What do you mean?

00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:19.377
It's been a year since the day we met.

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:21.720
That night, you were super drunk.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.399
If I didn't send you home back then...

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.240
Don't bring it up again.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.200
Sure.

00:15:27.444 --> 00:15:29.222
But you have to buy me some ice cream.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.919
Ice cream is meant for kids, you know?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.919
Who said so?

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:35.600
Both adults and kids love it.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.720
I loved ice cream when I was a kid.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.799
But my grandma
only sold popsicles in her store.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.639
Back then, ice cream was expensive.

00:15:42.977 --> 00:15:44.480
Grandma would only buy it for me

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:45.919
when I did great.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.279
Now that I'm all grown up,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.559
whenever I want to buy ice cream,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.639
I'll ponder over it

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.200
and wonder

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:56.159
if I did well

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.360
and if I deserved the ice cream.

00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:02.000
After that,
I won't feel like eating it anymore.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.679
Now, you can buy
all the ice cream you want.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.200
Let's go.

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:09.270
I'll buy you ice cream.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:10.480
Sure.

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:12.279
I want honeydew-flavored ice cream.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.000
Miss,

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.759
I want honeydew-flavored ice cream.

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:17.440
Sure.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.480
Only one?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.169
Yeah, only one.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.540
He wants a strawberry-flavored one.

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:21.919
I want vanilla.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.120
One honeydew and one vanilla, right?

00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:26.510
Please give me a moment.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.120
How much?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.799
15 yuan for one.
Just leave it there.

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:37.480
Today's the 15th of March 2025.

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.399
My stitches have been removed!

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.960
The weather today is scorching.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.120
But we're super lucky.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.960
We bumped into an ice cream truck.

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:46.879
And, Bizhi is buying me
an ice cream, too.

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:48.879
Thank you, Boss!

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.440
Here's your ice cream.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:52.480
Thanks.

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:53.840
Speaking of which,

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.399
Bizhi is the third person

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.500
who actually bought me ice cream
after my grandma.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.400
Which one is yours?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.359
This is mine.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.119
Why aren't you having it?

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.890
I thought
your favorite flavor was vanilla.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.960
I never said
my favorite flavor was vanilla.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.720
Try it.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.759
What do you think?

00:17:27.511 --> 00:17:29.666
Actually, this is my first time
having ice cream.

00:17:32.244 --> 00:17:34.088
I guess life
in the future is tough, huh?

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.599
The present is still the best.

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:38.559
We should buy some ice cream
for Market Lord next time.

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:40.680
Okay.

00:17:41.377 --> 00:17:42.110
Boss,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.000
when are we returning to the past again?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.839
There's no word yet.

00:17:48.844 --> 00:17:49.955
Let's wait a little longer.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:53.039
Well, I've fully recovered.

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.240
Please let me get back to work.

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:55.480
Boss?

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:56.640
Boss...

00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.680
Boss, let me get back to work.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.260
(Yashe)

00:18:22.555 --> 00:18:24.200
Are you looking at beautiful ladies?

00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:26.079
What do you know?

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:28.680
This is my idol.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.720
This is Miss Ye,
the chief auctioneer of Fusheng Hall.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.440
Spring is the season for romance.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.039
I feel like falling in love.

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:36.789
How dare you mock me?

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.079
You're asking for a beating!

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:38.839
Stop right there!

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:39.880
Stop right there!

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.790
You want to fall in love?

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.240
Look at the foolish look on your face!

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.960
Stop right there!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.720
Stop right there!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.480
Master Dong,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.079
it's fine if you want
to teach Su Beilu a lesson.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.799
But if you were to break
any of the pieces here,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.880
you have to compensate me accordingly.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.000
Who can afford that?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.799
I'll spare you for now.

00:19:05.755 --> 00:19:07.070
Sir, thank you for the rescue.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:07.960
Go away.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:09.079
Master Dong.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.440
Join us for dinner tonight.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.920
You're inviting me personally?
Of course I have to go.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.960
Let's leave together, then.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.759
Let's go.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.519
Remember to close the shop

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:19.599
and take Xuan Wu with you.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.279
Xuan Wu?

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:21.599
Remember to close the shop

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:22.888
and take Xuan Wu with you.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Do I need to take
its cage with me as well?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.640
Yeah.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.440
Yeah.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.359
You guys are back.

00:19:35.844 --> 00:19:37.160
Why are you guys here as well?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.480
Your boss invited us here.

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:40.880
With you two teaming up,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.640
everything gets done
twice as efficiently.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.222
I can entrust things to you two now.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.119
Today's just a normal day.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.440
Is there an occasion we're celebrating?

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.890
Who said we could only hold
a celebration during festive days?

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.039
Boss invited us because
he was touched by our passion.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.279
What's so strange about that?

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:59.440
I know now. You're celebrating the day
I got my stitches removed.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.440
That's not it.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.933
We merely wanted to hold a gathering.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.960
Boss has become
more lively and outgoing lately.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.600
Don't you think
it deserves a celebration?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.680
Yeah. Don't you agree?

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.733
And, Chun Ge has conquered
his gaming addiction lately.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.000
He's more diligent now.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:11.799
Yeah.

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:14.200
Although there's nothing
to celebrate about me,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.759
I'm starving.

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:16.759
Can we...

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.079
Yeah. Take your seats.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.960
Here.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.319
Sit down.

00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:22.640
Fill up the cups.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.440
Come on, let's dig in.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.559
This is great.

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:33.510
Cook the kelp a little
longer to remove the fishy smell.

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:35.119
If not, it'll smell fishy.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.440
But I like that smell.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.480
Wait!

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:44.920
I know there are plenty of feats
worth celebrating today.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.279
But I just got my stitches removed.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.960
I can't take any spicy food.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:50.680
Yeah.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.000
You can skip the meal, then.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.240
But we have to eat.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.559
Yeah, you should skip the meal.

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.160
We have water.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160
Rinse it in water.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.789
Yeah.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.200
What do you want?
I'll do it for you.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.680
Beef tripe
that's cooked for eight seconds.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.839
Just look at you.

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:05.400
How could you possibly
fall off your bike on a flat road?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.359
Was he on a bike?

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.039
Didn't you tell me

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:09.960
you tripped over a hole while walking?

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:10.599
Kid,

00:21:10.622 --> 00:21:14.070
you told me that you bumped your head on
this table when you were chasing Tuanzi.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.440
No matter what,

00:21:22.733 --> 00:21:24.720
Su Beilu got his stitches removed today.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.720
Here. Let's celebrate it.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.160
Here.

00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:26.720
- Here.
- Here.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.240
Let's celebrate it.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.039
- Let's celebrate it!
- Okay.

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:28.519
Here.

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:29.400
Cheers.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.839
Let's set a limit.

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:31.640
Let's not get drunk.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.269
Only a few sips.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.533
Don't let history repeat itself.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.680
Don't bring it up.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.440
The last time I came,
it was a phoenix-eye bead.

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:43.519
When I finally got it out
of Tuanzi's mouth,

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:45.519
it might as well
have turned into a vajra!

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:47.519
I was so heartbroken!

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:49.920
That phoenix-bead of mine
was filled with its saliva.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.200
I was so heartbroken.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.039
Chun Ge, how dare you criticize Tuanzi?

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.710
You puked all over
the floor after drinking.

00:21:55.711 --> 00:21:56.200
Yeah.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.519
And, I had to clean up your mess.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.680
Did that happen?

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.039
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.160
I don't care.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.599
Come, let's drink. Drink and forget.

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:04.839
- Here.
- Here.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.119
Cheers.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.911
The last time this house was this lively

00:22:12.955 --> 00:22:15.790
was when you guys came over
for the housewarming.

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:20.200
For the longest time,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.839
I was already used to living alone.

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:25.279
It was you guys
who made me feel once again

00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:27.440
how blessed it was to have friends

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.839
and occasions

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.920
to celebrate.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.440
Thank you all for keeping me company.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.519
As per your rules,

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.279
shouldn't I make the rounds?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.319
You want to do that?

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:45.319
Come on, let's do this.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.960
Master Dong.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.880
Sure. Here.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.880
You must remember this.

00:22:50.755 --> 00:22:53.000
Antiques that have been
passed down through generations

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.599
can never be obtained easily.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.599
Yes.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.519
You mustn't be deceived again.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.039
Don't worry about that.

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:01.079
Bizhi, ever since I got to know you,

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.160
my horizons have been broadened.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.000
Now, cheap knockoffs
don't even register on my radar.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.155
It seems you've grown.

00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:09.933
Here, bottoms up.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.240
Chun Ge.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:19.440
You're actually very brave.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.200
You can protect your friends

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.800
and accept them for who they are.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.000
But,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.759
can you just be a little braver?

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:34.839
I hope you find love soon.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.960
Min.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.000
Bizhi.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.440
Although we haven't
spent much time together,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.359
and you're always easygoing
when you're with us,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.359
I know

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:52.359
that you're a meticulous person.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.720
May I ask you for a favor?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Bizhi, please tell me.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.720
When I'm not around,

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:01.160
please look after Xuan Wu.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.799
No problem.

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:03.640
Just leave it to me.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.440
Thank you.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:14.440
Su Beilu.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.200
Tuanzi.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.310
Tuanzi,
you're waking him up again.

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:35.880
Tuanzi.

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:39.000
It's fine. I'm already awake.

00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:41.000
You only know how to cause a mess.

00:25:41.022 --> 00:25:41.800
You silly dog.

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:50.000
You didn't tell me
that you received a new mission.

00:25:50.777 --> 00:25:51.929
(Liangzhu Silk, Chunxing era)

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.088
(Youlan Alley, Youran Pavilion,
Zhao Wanli)

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.200
I received it not long ago.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.644
I didn't have the time to notify you.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.960
I know. You're just worried that I might
not have fully recovered yet.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.119
But I've fully recovered.

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:02.839
Look.

00:26:03.822 --> 00:26:04.880
I can even do a flying kick.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.240
I've already fully recovered.

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.640
Let's hurry and depart.

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:09.759
Okay.

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:11.279
Let's go. Time for a mission!

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.559
Let's go!

00:26:58.119 --> 00:26:59.759
This place is truly interesting.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.420
The pleasure quarters
and bustling wards,

00:27:02.422 --> 00:27:03.750
with singing courtesans, dancing girls,

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.860
and storytelling performers.

00:27:05.244 --> 00:27:07.866
They've kept countless people
lingering here, reluctant to leave.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.759
What are we looking for this time?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920
Liangzhu Silk.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.310
To put it more accurately,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.640
it's an "Autumn Twilight Painting"
painting on Liangzhu Silk.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:27.440
Youran Pavilion?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.039
This is the place.

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:37.559
What a strong alcohol smell.

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.799
Buddy.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.119
Buddy?

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.279
Don't tell me it's a case
of alcohol poisoning.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.160
(Zhao Wanli)

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.000
What were you doing?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.599
Wait...

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.519
I just pinched your philtrum.

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:10.799
It was a first-aid method.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.960
Who told you to save me?

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.559
Go away!

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.920
Are you Zhao Wanli,

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.680
the scholar?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.270
I heard that you have an Autumn Twilight
Painting in your collection.

00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.222
I don't know anything.

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:22.920
In my home,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.480
there is a fine cask of Ruilu liquor.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.359
Scholar Zhao, if you like it,

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:27.160
I can give it to you.

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:28.119
Not interested.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.319
It's not as good as my liquor.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.839
What a shame.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.960
We brought along half
a lifetime's worth of possessions

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.039
just to procure this painting.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.000
I'm afraid there's no way
to spend our money now.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:00.319
What did you say?

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:04.880
Half a lifetime's worth of possessions?

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.750
You guys want to buy
the Autumn Twilight Painting?

00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:08.599
That's right.

00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:10.190
But you have
to buy my other paintings

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.240
before I will sell
the Autumn Twilight Painting to you.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.400
What? Do painters like you all

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.720
sell bundle deals as well?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.759
Come, pick a painting.

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:16.279
Come.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.200
Come.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.559
Take a look.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.400
This one.

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:24.480
May I know

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.640
your name?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.839
My surname is Su.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.240
To

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.160
Su.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.740
(To Su.)

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.160
All done.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.799
500 wen.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.440
This isn't even a bundle deal.

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.640
This is daylight robbery.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.822
You think I don't know
the prices of this day and age?

00:29:43.622 --> 00:29:46.750
Just now, you said you brought along
half a lifetime's worth of possessions.

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.200
Now, you aren't even willing
to fork out 500 wen.

00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:51.920
Anyway, the painting already
has your name on it.

00:29:52.066 --> 00:29:53.550
There's no way I can sell this now.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.480
If you don't buy it, you won't get to see
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:57.759
This isn't about the price.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:59.880
Just look at that painting.
How is it worth 500 wen?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.079
Unfettered and unrestrained,

00:30:01.355 --> 00:30:02.880
its charm lies beyond the strokes.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.359
Excellent words.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.000
This mister is
much more generous indeed.

00:30:15.088 --> 00:30:16.710
What about the Autumn Twilight Painting?

00:30:16.888 --> 00:30:18.310
I'll find it for you right now.

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:27.200
The Autumn Twilight Painting...

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.240
It's over here.

00:30:33.977 --> 00:30:36.270
Since you're also
a straightforward person like me,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.640
I will

00:30:37.888 --> 00:30:39.480
charge you another 500 wen for this.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.319
Hey!

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:41.822
All these paintings look the same.

00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:43.720
I can tell at first glance
that this is fake.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720
What do you mean by that?

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.800
Have you seen the genuine
Autumn Twilight Painting before?

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.270
This is the real deal.

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:50.111
What? You think
I'm an uneducated buffoon?

00:30:50.177 --> 00:30:50.888
Tell me, then.

00:30:50.955 --> 00:30:53.200
Where's the "Autumn"?
And, where's the "Twilight"?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.160
I don't know even why
you have a pair of eyes.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.839
You simply can't grasp
the essence of this painting.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.400
You're utterly vulgar.

00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:01.590
What a country bumpkin!

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:03.160
You're the country bumpkin over here!

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.000
Give me a refund!

00:31:04.022 --> 00:31:06.222
How dare you sell
two lousy paintings for 1,000 wen?

00:31:06.244 --> 00:31:07.360
Stop pretending to be asleep!

00:31:07.377 --> 00:31:09.200
If you don't give me a refund,
I'll report you

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.244
to the local authorities!

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:15.440
Scholar Zhao, I don't know
why you're trying to hide it.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:17.480
But I'm earnest
in procuring the painting.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.550
The price can be negotiated
as long as you're willing to sell it.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.380
I'll provide you
with all the liquor you want.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.660
You said this Autumn Twilight Painting
was worth 500 wen.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.799
I'll be taking it.

00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:26.839
Hey.

00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:28.790
Are you actually buying it?

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.039
Farewell.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.240
Let's go.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.359
I have enough money for alcohol now.

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:09.480
How could he do this?

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.759
He forced a deal,

00:32:10.844 --> 00:32:12.622
and he even
deceived people with imitations.

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:13.519
But,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.599
is the Autumn Twilight Painting
a famous painting?

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.355
It became very famous
in later generations.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.799
But it's not popular yet right now.

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:22.000
Over a century ago,
Gu Zhiqian was merely

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.599
an unappreciated, down-and-out scholar.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.720
He repeatedly took
the imperial examinations

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.880
but failed every time.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.288
In the end, he died of depression.

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.440
Although his paintings
are masterfully painted,

00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:33.720
and possess a distinct style,

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.920
people in this era only wish

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.960
to pass the imperial exam
and strike it rich.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.440
His paintings are
considered inauspicious.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.519
So, it's not enough
for the paintings to be of high caliber.

00:32:43.622 --> 00:32:45.030
They have to be auspicious as well?

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:48.880
If you're bent on becoming
the top scholar and an official,

00:32:49.288 --> 00:32:51.720
will you collect the paintings
of an unfortunate soul?

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.559
If so, why did Zhao Wanli

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.319
copy so many of the same paintings?

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.119
Is he not afraid of bad luck?

00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:05.240
Let's ask him that question.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.039
Sir.

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.160
I'm not selling them.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.240
It's not even closing time yet.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:26.680
Where is he going?

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.720
(3,000 Drunken Tavern)

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.160
Scholar Zhao is here.

00:33:34.466 --> 00:33:36.160
You did great
at maintaining the flowers.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.079
Scholar Zhao.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.680
You're here again.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.519
Enjoy yourself.

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:55.000
Madam Ran.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.680
How are you doing today?

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.359
What are you doing here?

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.480
Didn't I tell you already?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.820
Don't come back unless you have
enough to pay off your tab.

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.440
Madam Ran, I beg to differ.

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:06.440
We've known each other
for so many years.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.280
How could I take advantage of you?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.311
Come on.

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:10.960
Take a look.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.719
Just look.

00:34:13.933 --> 00:34:16.440
(Ran Zhou'er, Shopkeeper
of 3,000 Drunken Tavern)

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.280
You actually sold
some paintings today, huh?

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.360
Of course.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.519
Give me a large vat.

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:33.920
Madam Ran, thank you for the wine.

00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:49.866
Nothing is more elegant
than poetry and books.

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.710
Nothing is more beautiful
than what's inside this pot.

00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:55.400
And, nothing is more fragrant

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.679
than Madam Ran's braised pork head.

00:34:57.755 --> 00:34:59.377
Have something to eat first

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.320
so that you won't puke
and dirty my shop again.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.159
Madam Ran, I'll learn from my lesson.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.159
You're right.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:06.239
You and your silver tongue.

00:35:06.866 --> 00:35:08.030
Let's make a promise today.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.190
At most, you'll have one vat.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.519
Understood.

00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:11.480
Understood.

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:14.920
(3,000 Drunken Tavern)

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.280
The braised pork head is delicious.

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:17.639
Here, try this.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.400
Life is but a grand dream,

00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:21.159
why trouble oneself?

00:35:21.755 --> 00:35:23.688
Better to spend the days
in drunken ease,

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.960
finding comfort
whether sitting or standing.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.039
Madam Ran,

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:35.840
give me the tab.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:36.840
Coming.

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:42.360
20 wen.

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:45.960
Madam Ran...

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.222
What are you doing?

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.760
Look at how fierce you look.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.159
It's no wonder you're unmarried

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:51.480
even at this age.

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:52.760
That's none of your business.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:55.960
Today, it's my business.

00:35:56.555 --> 00:35:57.630
What are you guys up to?

00:35:57.639 --> 00:35:58.639
What do you think?

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:00.100
This is a warning! Stay away from me!

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:00.920
Such audacity!

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:06.159
How dare you two do such a thing?

00:36:06.679 --> 00:36:08.519
How dare you bully Madam Ran

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:09.960
in front of me?

00:36:10.066 --> 00:36:11.110
Do you have a death wish?

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:11.760
Go away!

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.080
Where did this old fool come from?

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.199
Look at how drunk he is.

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:15.519
Can he save a damsel in distress?

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:16.360
Who are you calling an old fool?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.199
You.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.599
I'll spit on you!

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.719
What the heck?

00:36:19.866 --> 00:36:21.000
What are you trying to do?

00:36:26.955 --> 00:36:28.200
That felt great.

00:36:28.244 --> 00:36:30.000
You dirtied my garment!
You can't afford it!

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:30.800
Old fool!

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.200
You're itching for a beating, huh?

00:36:32.288 --> 00:36:33.840
Do you know how much my garment costs?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400
Let him go!

00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:38.400
How dare you cause trouble in my tavern?

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:38.960
Scram!

00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:40.280
Calm down!

00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:40.777
Calm down!

00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:43.155
Don't think that you can
bully girls all you want!

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.480
You perverted fools.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:48.840
Madam Ran, you're the best.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.679
Wake up.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.920
Wake up.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.844
Didn't we say that
you'd only drink one vat?

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.079
You drank so much.

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:00.710
That money you gave me isn't enough.

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.599
I'll pay his tab.

00:37:04.844 --> 00:37:06.030
You guys will pay for him?

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.039
Yeah.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.360
We came to this city just so
we could buy a painting from him.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.000
Since you're close to him,

00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:14.039
can you tell us his address?

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.719
We can send him back

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:16.880
as a sign of our sincerity.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.639
Send him back?

00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:20.800
His address?

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:21.880
It's very far away.

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:24.599
Are we there yet?

00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:31.559
Where is it?

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.000
I think this is the place.

00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:39.000
I'm not drunk.

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:42.400
Hold him. I'll get the door.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:42.880
Okay.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.840
Here.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.079
Slowly.

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.639
I'm not drunk.

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:55.440
Here.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.599
Slowly.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.119
Light the candle.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:18.920
What are you doing?

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.555
I'm looking for
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:21.679
This is wrong. Give it to me.

00:38:22.888 --> 00:38:24.630
Didn't you tell me to light the candle

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:26.599
so that we could look for the painting?

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:28.440
I told you to light the candle

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:30.760
to leave him with
a ray of light in the darkness.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:33.400
You're so kind.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.760
Just look at him.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.710
So many paintings here.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.679
He's a painting fanatic.

00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:37.920
If so, these are likely to be...

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920
This might be it...

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.559
Su Beilu,

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:40.280
give it to me.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.880
I'm not here to take his painting.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.079
I just want to take a look.

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:44.400
Hurry and put it down!

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.109
Don't take it!

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.288
I just want to take a look!

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.880
So, you two wanted
to steal my painting, huh?

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.422
Scholar Zhao, it's not what you think.

00:38:58.444 --> 00:38:59.670
Please listen to me.

00:38:59.679 --> 00:39:00.519
Stop denying it!

00:39:01.199 --> 00:39:03.280
You two may look like decent people,

00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:05.679
but you actually tried
to steal my paintings!

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:07.000
So what if I looked at your paintings?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.180
You deceived us this morning!

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.840
Shut up!

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.880
Stealing one's paintings is
like murdering one's parents!

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.440
It's a misunderstanding.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.599
We sent you home out of kind intentions!

00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:13.400
Shut up!

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.622
This is a misunderstanding!

00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:15.400
What are you doing?

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.559
Can you please calm down?

00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:18.239
This is a misunderstanding!

00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:19.119
Please calm down!

00:39:20.039 --> 00:39:20.760
Scholar Zhao!

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.159
Scram!

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.719
That stupid fool.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.920
He thinks he can steal my paintings.

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:29.480
I thought he was an alcoholic.

00:39:30.244 --> 00:39:31.590
It turns out that he's a lunatic.

00:39:31.644 --> 00:39:32.550
That stupid fool...

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:34.719
Why is he this terrifying when drunk?

00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:36.400
We don't do that when we get drunk.

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:38.599
He lets loose when he gets drunk!

00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:39.920
Let's return to Yashe for now.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.760
We shouldn't.

00:39:41.266 --> 00:39:44.022
It's not like this mission
is harder than the previous ones.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.550
We should try to persuade him.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.599
If we head inside again,

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:51.000
someone will die
if he comes out with a cleaver.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.133
We should head back first.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.599
You'd never be so quick
to give up before.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.590
I'm not trying to give up here.
I just don't know what to do.

00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.880
But I know what to do.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.933
What should we do, then?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.400
I'm thinking about it.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.239
Right now?

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:12.679
Who's there?

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:18.039
It's you guys again.

00:40:18.244 --> 00:40:19.280
Our tavern isn't open yet.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.355
Please come again later.

00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:22.119
We're here to pay off his tab.

00:40:22.355 --> 00:40:23.133
Pay off his tab?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.800
We'll pay off

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.440
all of Zhao Wanli's tab.

00:40:29.488 --> 00:40:32.070
I remember that you came here
to procure a painting from him.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.440
You two are quite sincere, aren't you?

00:40:35.044 --> 00:40:36.150
His tab has been paid off.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.480
I'll return the rest to you.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.519
By the way,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.840
has he ever mentioned

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.079
that he had a painting

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:45.599
called the Autumn Twilight Painting?

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:46.559
A landscape painting?

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:48.719
He does draw paintings all day long.

00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:50.480
But I don't know which one of them

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.800
is the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.509
Why is he this despondent, then?

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.111
Why does he spend his days drinking?

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.000
You see,

00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:02.800
Zhao Wanli was
a man of talent and pride.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.920
In his youth, he was also
full of vigor and ambition.

00:41:05.933 --> 00:41:06.690
He even swore

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.200
that he wouldn't get married
until he passed the imperial exam.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.719
But in the end,

00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:13.039
he failed the imperial exam
time and time again.

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:14.840
That was how he ended up like this.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.639
So,

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.119
he kept taking the imperial exam

00:41:18.155 --> 00:41:19.550
without seeking another path, huh?

00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:21.119
He's so darned stubborn.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.711
I tried to convince him to give up.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.559
But he said I didn't know him.

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:26.360
I don't.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.639
But he doesn't know me either.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.400
That fool.

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:35.599
After that, he said

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:37.840
that fame and fortune
were but an illusion.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.280
In the end?

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.177
He started drowning himself in sorrow.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.800
If I didn't sell any liquor to him,

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.844
he would fall out with me.

00:41:43.866 --> 00:41:45.200
I couldn't do anything about him.

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:49.119
Does he drink at your tavern every day?

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:50.320
Yeah.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.480
Only our tavern

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.480
allowed him to run up such a tab.

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:54.519
Moreover,

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:55.760
he's very picky.

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:58.599
He only loves
the Nv'er Hong liquor we serve here.

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:06.199
You're here again.

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:08.559
Beautiful flowers.

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:09.559
Zhao.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.230
- You're closing your stall, huh?
- Zhao.

00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:12.000
Yes.

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:14.760
Let's drink today
while our liquor remains.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.599
Oh, my dear.

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:19.639
Scholar Zhao.
