As for the punishment you'll receive,

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:25.759

Now, you want to talk about the law?

how precious your life is.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.519

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:27.690

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.570
that you falsely accused
an imperial official.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:45.559

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.590
It was said to be an acute illness.

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:15.000
Nobody touches her.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.279
What if that person is burdened with

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.879
a blood feud she can't let go of?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.240

Once we managed to overturn

Not everyone can afford it.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.580
From now on, our ties are severed.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.960
Reporting for no reason

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.039
and disturbing the people.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.399
Take her away.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.879
(I entrusted my heart to him,)

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.920
(and even went through
thick and thin with him.)

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.759
(But in the end?
It was all just a dream.)

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.039
It's on fire! We need help!

00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:33.679
Changning!

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.759
(How come it ended like this)

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:46.120
(even though
I'd already given it my all?)

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.000
(I refuse to accept this.)

00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:51.062
(End of Episode)

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.600
I'll take her away
by hook or by crook today.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.320
Kneel and beg,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.279
and I might give you a chance to do so.
