PRO BONO

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:39.394
There she comes.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.855
It's her.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.066
Ms. Cha Jin-hui.

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:47.402
Pick whichever one you need.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.737
Elijah!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.240
My goodness, congratulations!

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:58.621
-Congratulations!
-Elijah's mother tipped us off herself.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.456
Do you know that?

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:05.670
I had been so angry
because of Ma Yeong-suk.

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:08.006
How did you make time?

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:11.968
Well, I just had to come, of course.
I heard the great news today.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.887
It's pretty confusing, isn't it?

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:16.723
All right.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:18.975
-Let's thank them.
-Shall we?

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:21.895
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:24.689
-Yes, you did a great job.
-It was nothing, ma'am.

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.192
Goodness, excuse me
if I'd been rude to you.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.068
I apologize.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:33.406
It's embarrassing,
but that's what it's like to be a mother.

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.160
When it involves your child,
you panic and get overwhelmed.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.954
And you become blinded by rage.

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:41.873
That's how it is. I'm sorry.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.042
No, I completely understand.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:48.421
That's how it feels when you're a mother.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:51.549
-Thank you.
-Mom.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.886
These pro bono attorneys
did an amazing job too.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:57.347
Right. Goodness, thank you so much.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.973
It was nothing at all.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:02:00.850
Mr. Jang stayed up all night

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.061
to do the hardest part
of tracking IP addresses.

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:06.522
Really? All those… Thank you.

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:08.942
No need to thank me. It was nothing.

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:09.859
-Yeong-sil.
-Yeah?

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:13.321
You said Ji-hye was Elijah's avid fan.
Ask her for an autograph.

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.114
-I also want one.
-My autograph?

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:18.159
There's a client
I've been advising recently,

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.786
and she's a big fan of yours.

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.040
She would be thrilled
if she could get your autograph.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.710
If you're helping her,
she must be in a very difficult situation.

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:32.173
You should come with her sometime.
I'll give her an autograph in person.

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:34.801
-You would meet with her?
-Yes.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.803
She's going to be ecstatic.

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:38.763
Thank you, Elijah.

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:43.268
We have a bit of a busy schedule.

00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.353
-So, please excuse us.
-Of course.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.439
You all are full of surprising charm.

00:02:48.523 --> 00:02:51.025
We'll get going now.

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.277
Thank you!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.987
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye!

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:57.115
Do you think it's true?

00:02:57.782 --> 00:03:00.410
"How could a mother do that?"

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:02.912
Is that what you mean?

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:06.124
What was that? What about a mother?

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:08.751
You have good ears.

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:13.631
That would be ridiculous.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:15.675
Her mother tipped them off?

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:16.592
EPISODE 8

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.512
Right? She doesn't have any motives.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.724
Before being a mom,
she's the CEO of her agency.

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:24.058
What would she get out of it?

00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:26.811
I have a feeling Gu Ji-hwan is right.

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:28.730
What? Why?

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:32.608
He's known for making a living
by doing a variety of dirty work

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.569
for clients
in the entertainment industry.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:37.405
Ms. Cha might have asked him
to do something.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:39.824
No way. But they're family.

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:42.452
How could a parent
do that to her child?

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.495
Family can be more cruel
than anyone else.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:48.041
I'm surprised
to hear you sound so cynical.

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:48.958
What?

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.377
Well, it's just…

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.214
It's probably because of Ji-hye's case
that I've been working on.

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:57.925
In any case, we won today.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.220
Nan-hui was the star today,
so it'll be her treat.

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:03.806
-Sounds good.
-What? Why would you…

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.185
It's on me! Because I'm not petty!

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:09.228
Eat and drink all you want! Cheers!

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.897
Cheers!

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:12.857
You know how petty I am.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.614
What is it?

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.367
Isn't that Elijah's boyfriend?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.284
Why? What is it?

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:24.619
ELIJAH'S MAN IS A CHEATER?

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:28.122
-Has this prick lost his mind?
-Hey, it's mine.

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:30.416
What a jerk!

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.627
-Who's a jerk?
-Mr. Kang.

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:36.214
-What?
-Let's meet with Ms. Cha right now.

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:37.298
What?

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:39.801
I think I know
what she asked Gu Ji-hwan to do.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.185
Are you kidding me right now?

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:51.729
Why can't you understand?

00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:54.690
You think the words just come right out
when I write songs?

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:58.569
It was just a mistake I made
while I was working!

00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:00.488
Just let it go.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.573
Shut up, you jerk!

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:09.831
Are you okay?

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.210
Yeah, I'm all right.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.674
By the way, the attorneys
are in Ms. Cha's office right now.

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:21.092
What?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.094
Why?

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:26.264
Please come and sit.

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:31.144
I'd like to say this first.

00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:33.312
I don't know if you'll believe me,

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:35.314
but with issues
between a mother and her child,

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:36.816
I can't be objective.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.235
I'm always on the mother's side.

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:43.781
Okay, and why do you say that?

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:50.413
Why did you do that?

00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:53.124
What are you talking about?

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:56.210
You tipped them off
about Elijah's boyfriend, didn't you?

00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:00.673
What are you basing that on?

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:02.717
I'm a bit confused.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.887
The online site that released
the article on her cheating boyfriend

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.515
is run by Mr. Gu Ji-hwan
under a different name.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.810
Ms. Cha, do you know
what kind of person he is?

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:16.606
He's an attorney, but he makes a living
using others' weaknesses to threaten them.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.901
Someone like that doesn't care
about protecting their clients.

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:23.446
He came and ratted you out
as soon as he was cornered.

00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:26.741
You're her mother.

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:29.035
How could you tell him
about your daughter's affairs?

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:32.830
Because I'm her mother.

00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:34.498
Sorry?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.295
I would do even worse things
if it was for my child.

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.218
-It was you?
-Let's talk outside.

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.260
Let's go out.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:48.596
It's my privacy.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:49.889
Did you really do that?

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:52.141
Why on earth would you?

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.060
Did you want to destroy me?

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:55.686
No!

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.730
Why would I want that?

00:06:57.813 --> 00:06:59.398
I just asked him

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:02.193
to get that awful jerk away from you.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:05.238
Trust me. It was for your own good.

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:07.949
No, please.

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:11.118
I was worried
you'd go down the wrong path. Please.

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:14.372
They go around digging in others' privacy.

00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:16.832
Don't you know
what kind of people they are?

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.793
After getting paid by you,

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:22.004
they tried to make more money
by revealing her boyfriend for clickbait.

00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:26.133
I must have lost my mind.

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:31.514
To me, that guy wasn't the one for her,
but my Elijah kept insisting.

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:33.933
How can a mother

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:37.395
just sit by and watch
when her child is making a mistake?

00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:38.312
How?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.398
You're right.

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:42.191
He's garbage.

00:07:42.275 --> 00:07:45.570
Yes. You know it now too, don't you?

00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:49.323
But he was garbage that I chose.

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.033
Come on…

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.744
I should have been the one who dumped him.

00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:56.998
Elijah.

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:00.126
It was for your own good.

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:03.254
I only did it for my precious daughter.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.386
I'm sick of it now, Mom.

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:14.015
Elijah.

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.104
What am I going to do?

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:27.528
Elijah!

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:28.696
Gosh.

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:32.158
Calm down.

00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:34.994
Calm down already.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.669
Her boyfriend cheated on her,

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:47.882
and her mother leaked that information
to a garbage-tier YouTube channel.

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:52.386
Seriously, why are they
doing this to my Elijah?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.346
I know.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:56.223
How could he cheat on someone like Elijah?

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:57.600
There, there.

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:01.520
So many guys chased after her,

00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:03.898
but they all ran away within six months.

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:07.193
This makes no sense.
What's there not to like about her?

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.312
MESSAGE

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:51.278
I'm really sorry.

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:53.114
It won't ever happen again.

00:09:54.532 --> 00:09:55.991
I promise.

00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:58.244
Please forgive me.

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.714
Can I really trust you this time?

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:16.679
You haven't eaten anything today.

00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:19.640
You'll get in trouble
if you keep doing this.

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:22.309
Let's go. You have to
eat something. Come on.

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:23.769
It's all right.

00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:25.813
I'm only halfway through practice.

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:27.356
Don't be like that.

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:32.361
As you know, the fate of our agency
depends on my US debut.

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.988
We've invested so much in the album.

00:10:34.697 --> 00:10:36.282
I can still take it.

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:37.992
Why are you always so worried?

00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:43.581
We'll start again.

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:06.020
Let's not do this between colleagues.
I'm an attorney too.

00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:08.397
Business has been bad,
so what choice do I have?

00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:10.941
I have to prey on other attorneys
to make ends meet.

00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:13.652
I'm gathering your victims

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:17.364
to pursue a class-action lawsuit
against you for damages.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.451
It's nothing personal.

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:22.203
I feel terrible too.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:24.121
Please help me out.

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:27.458
Don't do this, Judge Kang.

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:30.461
What is with you?
You know how things work.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.588
Like I said, I feel bad.

00:11:33.422 --> 00:11:34.548
I'll do anything…

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:38.302
I'll do anything
you want me to do. I will.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.763
Just help me out this one time.

00:11:40.846 --> 00:11:43.474
I don't need anything from you.

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:44.725
-But--
-However…

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.479
I do have a question.

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:52.149
Yes. Go ahead. Ask me anything.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.401
Elijah's mother, Ms. Cha.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.530
-Yes.
-Was this your first deal with her?

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:02.159
Well… We've been doing business
for a while now.

00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:06.372
At first, I gathered inside information
on the entertainment industry.

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:09.542
What about after Elijah got into college?

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:12.086
I made sure
that losers stayed away from her.

00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:16.423
Interesting. Did you go old school
and hire thugs to…

00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:17.675
No.

00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:19.593
-That's outdated.
-It is?

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.011
Yeah. So…

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:24.557
I simply hire a nice looking guy.

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:26.183
A guy?

00:12:26.267 --> 00:12:27.393
To guys chasing Elijah,

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:29.270
he comes and says,

00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:33.023
"I'm seeing Elijah. Okay?"

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:35.568
"Go away. Stop hanging around her!"

00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:38.779
Would they really believe what he says?

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:40.239
-They would.
-What?

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:44.660
They believe it when he shows
photos of Elijah sleeping in her pajamas.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:48.289
Photos of Elijah in her pajamas?
Where would you get…

00:12:48.372 --> 00:12:49.206
Ms. Cha.

00:12:50.374 --> 00:12:53.586
She gave me the photos
and ordered me to do it.

00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:57.506
Use these this time
to drive those losers away. Okay?

00:12:58.299 --> 00:12:59.341
Isn't it crazy?

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:03.345
The parents of celebrities hate it
when their children date.

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:06.056
They want to hold on
and mooch off of them forever.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.850
If some random person takes them away,

00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:10.311
it's not fair.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.022
Bastard.

00:13:13.689 --> 00:13:14.523
What?

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.900
-What a bastard.
-Me?

00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:21.864
-I've seen you somewhere though.
-What?

00:13:24.116 --> 00:13:25.284
You're…

00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:27.494
You're going to help me out, right?

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.413
How about this one?

00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:31.040
It's so-so.

00:13:31.123 --> 00:13:33.500
Bring me something striking.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.544
Yes, Ms. Cha.

00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:45.429
You're the newest one, aren't you?
You're good at your job.

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.347
Thank you, ma'am.

00:13:47.014 --> 00:13:48.891
Please take your time, Ms. Cha.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.352
You know what I like too.

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:56.482
Ms. Cha.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:14:00.194
Okay. How about this one?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.325
Let me help you--

00:14:06.408 --> 00:14:09.536
No, not you. You do it.

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:11.538
Yes, Ms. Cha.

00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:34.603
Hello, Mr. Kang.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:36.647
Hello, this is Kang Da-wit.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.732
I've given it some thought,

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.610
but I think I should tell you.

00:14:42.528 --> 00:14:43.988
What is it?

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:48.283
Sorry?

00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:56.291
I'm worried about Elijah.

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:00.004
I know. She must've been so shocked.

00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:07.219
Hello.

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:08.637
Hi.

00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:13.726
Wait. Elijah, what brings you here?

00:15:16.228 --> 00:15:19.231
Your office is much bigger
and nicer than I thought.

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:27.448
Don't tell me…

00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:37.624
The thing is, Mom…

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:39.585
What on earth were you doing?

00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:43.172
You're the company director, but didn't
know she was gone? What were you doing?!

00:15:43.255 --> 00:15:45.340
I heard you didn't even
show up to work today!

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.885
Actually, Mom,

00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:52.598
I went to see the doctor
with So-yeon today.

00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:54.016
You…

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:57.186
For goodness' sake. What do we do now?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.855
Hurry and find her!

00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:02.232
Did you run away from home?

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:06.111
My mom's house is right next to mine.

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.489
I can't go on like this anymore.

00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:10.657
Where are you going to stay then?

00:16:12.993 --> 00:16:15.579
For now, I'll stay in a hotel
until I find a new place.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.165
But that's not what matters.

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:20.459
I don't know much about the law,

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:23.837
but this isn't a simple issue
between a mother and her daughter.

00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:26.256
Am I right?

00:16:27.758 --> 00:16:31.303
Yes, it's a case
between an artist and her company.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:32.971
Yes.

00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:35.516
The agency deceived its artist

00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:37.559
and interfered in
and leaked her private matters.

00:16:37.643 --> 00:16:39.978
It's an outrageous breach of contract.

00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:44.775
Then…

00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:49.613
I want to end the exclusive contract
with my company.

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:53.450
Please file a lawsuit.

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:01.792
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.337
Gosh, look who's here.

00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:11.009
Isn't it Mr. Woo, who lost his client
to someone without a college degree?

00:17:13.137 --> 00:17:15.264
Gosh, look who's here.

00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:17.808
Isn't it Mr. Kang,
the lawyer without a college degree

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:21.186
who stole someone's client
by using Elijah's fans?

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.731
I heard you couldn't let it go
and went to see Ms. Cha,

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:26.775
asking her to give you this case.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.653
Do you want to lose to me that badly?

00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:31.655
A little snot came out.

00:17:32.698 --> 00:17:34.074
Think whatever you want.

00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:35.617
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:38.203
And I'll think however I want too.

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:40.831
SUIT DISPUTING EXCLUSIVITY

00:17:40.914 --> 00:17:42.833
Your Honor,
the plaintiff has already sent

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:45.586
a certified letter notifying
the termination of her contract.

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:47.171
We request that you confirm

00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:50.966
the non-existence
of an exclusive contract between the two.

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:53.677
Which part of the contract
justifies the termination?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.891
Your Honor, perhaps I still don't have
enough legal experience.

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:00.976
But I've never seen
a contract like this before.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.438
The defendant, EK Entertainment,
is the dominant party.

00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:07.733
The plaintiff, Elijah,
is the subordinate party.

00:18:07.816 --> 00:18:11.862
As you can see, the subordinate party's
contractual obligations are…

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:13.822
One, two, three, four…

00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:18.202
How many are there?
There are more than 20.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.121
"Comply with the company orders
without question."

00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:24.750
"No social media. Maintain a strict diet."

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:28.629
On the other hand, the dominant party
does not have any obligations.

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:30.380
Zero.

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:34.551
You indeed are the dominant party.

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:38.388
Didn't the plaintiff read
and sign the contract?

00:18:38.472 --> 00:18:40.265
When your mom hands you
a contract to sign,

00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:43.227
what child is going to
read it thoroughly line by line?

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.979
On top of that,
she had just finished high school.

00:18:46.063 --> 00:18:49.983
As an adult, she should at least know
that she has to be responsible

00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:52.819
for the contract she signed.

00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:56.073
But on what grounds

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:58.033
are you terminating
the exclusive contract?

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:00.327
It's a breakdown of trust.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:06.541
Which article and paragraph
of the contract is that mentioned in?

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.585
Whether it is stated
in the contract or not,

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:12.005
trust is essential given the nature
of an exclusive contract.

00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:15.634
Precedent has shown
it can be terminated once trust is broken.

00:19:15.717 --> 00:19:17.970
You must have forgotten
much of the Civil Act

00:19:18.053 --> 00:19:20.138
after working so long as a prosecutor.

00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:21.515
I understand.

00:19:21.598 --> 00:19:23.809
Aren't you the one who's forgotten

00:19:23.892 --> 00:19:27.521
about the relationship
between the plaintiff and the defendant?

00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:30.107
-Is that a question?
-Does it sound like an answer?

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.609
I'll answer for you
since it seems you don't know.

00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:35.028
They are mother and daughter.

00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:36.989
-Gosh, I see.
-You didn't know.

00:19:37.781 --> 00:19:40.450
The breakdown of trust
between a mother and daughter.

00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:44.955
Are you trying to sever
the sacred bond between family?

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:47.249
What have I done that was so wrong?

00:19:47.332 --> 00:19:50.043
I've only done my best for my daughter.

00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:54.298
You have never once respected
the plaintiff's free will.

00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:58.885
What, because I worried
my precious daughter would date a bad guy?

00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:01.847
Because I pushed her
to dream big and not settle?

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.557
That was wrong?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.143
Then, every parent
in this county is guilty!

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:10.856
Ms. Cha, you have demanded the plaintiff
undergo an abnormal level of dieting,

00:20:10.939 --> 00:20:13.817
infringing on her physical
and mental health tremendously.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.944
As it's a profession with high visibility,

00:20:16.028 --> 00:20:19.823
she simply persuaded her daughter
she had to put in more effort than others.

00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:23.827
How can she become better if she only does
the same as everyone else?

00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:26.830
I am her mother.

00:20:26.913 --> 00:20:30.625
What mother would hurt
her daughter deliberately?

00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:32.127
Okay, all right.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.296
Please calm down. Plaintiff.

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:36.214
Please continue with your argument.

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:39.176
It leaves us with no choice, Your Honor.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.012
I request that you order the defendant
to disclose details

00:20:42.095 --> 00:20:44.556
of income and expenditures
for the plaintiff's entire career,

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:48.018
and submit the related accounting ledgers.

00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:49.353
What?!

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:50.312
Goodness.

00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:52.689
Do you really want to
play this out to the end?

00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:57.110
Plaintiff, please submit
the relevant grounds in writing.

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:05.577
Elijah, are you all right?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.330
You didn't have to
come in person to court.

00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:09.873
I'm not going to avoid it.

00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:11.958
It's my business.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:15.128
It'll only get uglier.
That's how trials are.

00:21:15.212 --> 00:21:16.713
I'm ready for it.

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:22.928
Geez, I'm fine.

00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:26.723
Anyway, after skipping practice
for the first time in eight years,

00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:28.558
the day feels so long.

00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:32.354
It feels so lonely
staying in the hotel all by myself.

00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:35.982
Elijah.

00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:39.069
We have a vacant room at my place.

00:21:39.152 --> 00:21:41.696
-It's not fancy, but do you want to come?
-Really?

00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.408
I'd love that.

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:47.661
-But will it be okay with you?
-Of course. Come with me.

00:21:47.744 --> 00:21:48.745
Sure!

00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:50.956
Ms. Park,

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:54.209
you're not going to make her
serve food at the bakery, are you?

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:56.878
To get rich by getting fans
from all over the world to visit?

00:21:56.962 --> 00:21:58.380
Mr. Kang!

00:21:58.463 --> 00:22:01.383
Don't always view the world
from your perspective.

00:22:06.763 --> 00:22:08.348
I think you liked the idea.

00:22:12.477 --> 00:22:14.062
Geez, EK Entertainment!

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:17.149
We asked for income and expenditure data,

00:22:17.232 --> 00:22:19.484
and they sent a bunch
of useless stuff too!

00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:24.531
So they're trying to mess with us?
My goodness!

00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:27.617
It's not easy to win
an exclusive contract termination case.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:29.119
As for the boyfriend issue,

00:22:29.202 --> 00:22:32.080
they'll blur things
with mother-daughter relationship stuff,

00:22:32.706 --> 00:22:34.624
so we have to dig into the payments issue.

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:37.586
If we find something here,
there's no way out for them.

00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:40.547
What are you all doing?
Get ready to stay up.

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:42.257
Look at Mr. Jang.

00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:46.678
It's cramped there,
so come here and work.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.849
What a terrible working environment.

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:54.352
Being a pro bono attorney…

00:22:54.936 --> 00:22:55.979
It's terrible.

00:22:56.062 --> 00:22:57.314
We can do it!

00:22:57.397 --> 00:22:58.815
-Let's go!
-We can do it!

00:23:08.241 --> 00:23:11.703
Over there. She's a famous singer.

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:16.833
Hello…

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:20.003
Hello.

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:21.421
Hello.

00:23:21.504 --> 00:23:23.965
I'll be staying here for a few days.

00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:25.926
You know sign language?

00:23:27.844 --> 00:23:29.137
In the past,

00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:31.223
I learned it for a film shoot.

00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:33.600
But I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:35.810
It's right. You're really good.

00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:36.853
Thank you.

00:23:39.022 --> 00:23:39.940
Just a moment.

00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:44.694
It's all right.

00:23:49.783 --> 00:23:51.701
It's because I'm bored.

00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:53.203
Is it okay to help you?

00:23:53.787 --> 00:23:57.791
Gi-ppeum will scold us
if we make you work.

00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:03.588
I promise I won't tell her.

00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:07.092
It's okay.

00:24:08.802 --> 00:24:09.803
What do we do?

00:24:09.886 --> 00:24:10.929
We might be in trouble.

00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:17.727
The earnings from music sales
and performances are substantial.

00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.438
Why take in more investment
when they were making good money?

00:24:20.522 --> 00:24:24.192
I wonder if they
even paid Elijah properly.

00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:26.194
I doubt it.

00:24:26.278 --> 00:24:27.779
Probably not.

00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:32.367
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

00:24:33.076 --> 00:24:34.953
Could you take a look at this?

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:37.998
The money flowed
into these foreign companies.

00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:40.667
-Okay.
-It's such a strange flow.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.295
-It isn't normal.
-I smell something fishy.

00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:45.588
Doesn't it smell like ramyeon?

00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:49.134
Is he eating alone? How cheap.

00:24:51.553 --> 00:24:52.971
Doesn't it smell like distrust?

00:24:53.888 --> 00:24:56.099
Kang Da-wit is the best!

00:24:56.182 --> 00:24:59.019
I was especially craving
ramyeon today for some reason.

00:24:59.644 --> 00:25:01.688
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:03.148
Thank you.

00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:04.232
Where are we?

00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:07.610
Ms. Park just showed us something.

00:25:07.694 --> 00:25:10.238
-You should take a look.
-Okay.

00:25:12.324 --> 00:25:15.744
Mr. Kim, as company director
of EK Entertainment,

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:18.371
you are responsible
for finances and accounting. Correct?

00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:19.581
Yes, I am.

00:25:19.664 --> 00:25:23.043
Since last year, you've pushed to bring in
investments for Elijah's entrance

00:25:23.126 --> 00:25:24.836
in the US market, correct?

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:25.879
Yes, that's right.

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:31.384
Elijah must have made a lot of money
from music sales and performances.

00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:35.013
You still needed
additional external funds?

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:39.142
-You don't know how this business works.
-I see.

00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:42.729
It requires a fortune
to create a global artist.

00:25:42.812 --> 00:25:47.192
The expenses for consulting and marketing
to enter the overseas market--

00:25:47.275 --> 00:25:49.027
Is that so? Expenses like these?

00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:55.700
Halford & Brown Company in LA
and JC Mackenzie in New York.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:57.410
How did you…

00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:00.205
But the thing is,

00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:03.208
we found signs that showed
more than half of the funds

00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:08.004
that were sent to these companies
was transferred to a third company.

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:10.882
After going through various steps
of money laundering,

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:13.134
the money ended up right there.

00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:16.513
A limited company located
in an offshore tax haven called

00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:22.227
It's "hope," right?

00:26:22.727 --> 00:26:24.896
I don't know.
What does that have to do with me?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.483
You failed to attract investments
in the end. Why was that?

00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:32.195
That was the investors' call.
Why would you ask me that?

00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:35.240
Wasn't the failed investments
due to accounting fraud?

00:26:35.323 --> 00:26:39.786
Your Honor, Mr. Kang is asking
leading questions based on speculation.

00:26:41.287 --> 00:26:43.248
Do you have grounds, Counsel?

00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:45.625
We will submit them if needed.

00:26:46.251 --> 00:26:49.879
This is the actual audit report
from an investor's accounting team.

00:26:50.547 --> 00:26:53.716
"The balance sheet
of EK Entertainment cannot be trusted."

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.177
"Capital outflow has been confirmed."

00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:59.639
You siphoned off the profits
that were to be paid to the plaintiff.

00:26:59.722 --> 00:27:01.975
No! Those were all fabricated!

00:27:02.642 --> 00:27:04.519
-Busted.
-Let me ask you one more thing.

00:27:04.602 --> 00:27:07.730
In the truckload of documents
you submitted,

00:27:07.814 --> 00:27:09.190
someone found this.

00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:13.570
Mr. Kim, insurance fees
were part of your expenditures.

00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:15.864
It was a substantial amount.

00:27:15.947 --> 00:27:16.823
What was this for?

00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:19.200
How would I remember all the details?

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:21.244
I think you do remember all the details.

00:27:22.537 --> 00:27:24.956
We tracked it down,
and it was a life insurance plan.

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:29.294
It was life insurance
for Elijah, your sister.

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.463
That's…

00:27:31.546 --> 00:27:32.589
At the…

00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:35.383
At the company level,

00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:36.843
for the artist--

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:40.096
"For the artist."
Who is the beneficiary though?

00:27:42.182 --> 00:27:45.518
The person who will get that money
if anything happens to Elijah.

00:27:45.602 --> 00:27:48.813
The sole shareholder of Hope,
where the money was sent.

00:27:48.897 --> 00:27:51.274
They were the same person.

00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:57.071
Seven-year-old Kim So-yeon.

00:27:57.697 --> 00:27:58.948
Your only daughter.

00:27:59.824 --> 00:28:02.035
No! They're all lies…

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:03.161
SOLE SHAREHOLDER OF HOPE

00:28:03.244 --> 00:28:04.120
This is a lie.

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:08.166
Your Honor, this is all
merely vague speculation.

00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:11.586
You can borrow your family's name
to open an account.

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:15.215
Plaintiff's Counsel, you should file
a criminal suit for embezzlement instead.

00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:19.177
Stop making malicious false accusations
based on unverified evidence.

00:28:20.428 --> 00:28:21.387
Okay?

00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:25.517
We will submit the relevant evidence.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.445
How dare you scam your mom?

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:38.780
You stupid prick!

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:40.657
I told you not to get greedy!

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:44.285
You took much more than I did,
so why are you yelling at me?

00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:46.538
You shouldn't have gotten caught then!

00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.581
Who do you think you are to be so greedy?

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:52.752
What? I'm not allowed to be greedy?

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:54.462
What?

00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:55.922
Grandma!

00:28:56.005 --> 00:28:57.924
Why did you come out, So-yeon?

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:00.635
Hi, Grandma.

00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:02.554
Play with me.

00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:04.597
I need to talk to your dad,
so go back inside.

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.392
So-yeon, you'll get sick out here.
Let's hurry inside.

00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:09.644
Grandma.

00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:15.024
Just go. She's coughing!

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:18.903
That little prick…

00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:22.907
I'll raise my daughter
to be way better than Elijah. Got it?

00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:27.287
I'm going to give her anything she wants.
The best of everything!

00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:37.964
-Hello.
-Ji-hye.

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:39.966
Elijah.

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:42.302
This is Ji-hye.

00:29:43.636 --> 00:29:44.846
Hello.

00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:46.931
Elijah.

00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:50.101
Are you really Elijah?

00:29:51.561 --> 00:29:53.062
Yes. It's me, Ji-hye.

00:29:54.856 --> 00:29:56.482
You know my name?

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:59.569
I can't… I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:29:59.652 --> 00:30:01.237
Of course not, Ji-hye.

00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:03.907
I really love your music, big sis.

00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:07.035
I can't wait for your next song.

00:30:10.663 --> 00:30:11.748
Am I really your big sis?

00:30:12.457 --> 00:30:14.667
-Yeah.
-They say the big sis is the cool one.

00:30:16.878 --> 00:30:18.421
Okay, then.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:22.175
Should we take out the things
I prepared for Ji-hye?

00:30:23.676 --> 00:30:25.428
Gifts!

00:30:27.096 --> 00:30:30.016
Ta-da! It's my merchandise.
You know Ponies, right?

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:33.853
-Is it really okay for me to take this?
-Of course. Here.

00:30:35.563 --> 00:30:38.191
This is a T-shirt with my face on it.

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:41.152
It's Elijah!

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:42.987
Thank you.

00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:45.949
There's a lot of stuff.

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:51.245
She gave so many gifts.

00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:59.253
Thank you, Elijah.

00:31:00.672 --> 00:31:02.215
We'll get going.

00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:09.347
Good night.

00:31:13.226 --> 00:31:17.480
Did you say Ji-hye's uncle took
her parents' death benefits?

00:31:18.189 --> 00:31:20.650
Yes. According to Mr. Jang,

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:24.320
he might be abusing her too.

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:27.031
How could he do that to someone so nice?

00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:32.787
What even is family?

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:35.665
Elijah.

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:40.294
Did you really have no idea
that you weren't being paid correctly?

00:31:41.838 --> 00:31:43.381
Mom always said

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.926
she would take care of the money,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.846
so I could focus only on music
without worrying about it.

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:50.972
And you believed that?

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:55.018
She's my mother.

00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:58.855
Someone who wishes the best for me.

00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:02.608
Did you trust her?
Or did you want to trust her?

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:12.618
DEFENDANT

00:32:15.204 --> 00:32:16.497
Plaintiff's Counsel.

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.334
Plaintiff's Counsel!

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:22.503
Yes, Your Honor.

00:32:23.296 --> 00:32:24.547
Your Honor.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:29.093
To expose the defendant's non-payment
and embezzlement of music revenue,

00:32:29.177 --> 00:32:33.014
we will file a lawsuit
for embezzlement against Mr. Kim.

00:32:33.097 --> 00:32:36.851
We request a tentative hearing date
until the investigation results come in.

00:32:36.934 --> 00:32:38.311
Plaintiff's Counsel.

00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:42.231
Since you studied it so long ago,
did you forget all about the Criminal Act?

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:44.817
What do you mean?

00:32:45.902 --> 00:32:48.196
Article 361

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:50.698
and Article 328, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:55.286
Exemption of Crimes by Family.

00:32:55.912 --> 00:32:59.665
These are fundamental basics.
And you were even a judge.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.253
Property crimes committed
within family cannot be punished.

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.216
Did you forget
that a sibling can't be penalized

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:10.343
only if they live together?

00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:13.387
If they live apart, they can be punished.

00:33:14.305 --> 00:33:16.974
Does Mr. Kim live with the plaintiff?

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:18.976
Put it up.

00:33:20.478 --> 00:33:23.773
This is a family photo
taken early last year.

00:33:23.856 --> 00:33:26.526
The whole family lived together back then.

00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:30.696
The plaintiff knew about it.
Did the plaintiff's counsel not know?

00:33:32.532 --> 00:33:35.868
Your Honor, the capital outflow
that the plaintiff claims

00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:39.622
mostly occurred
while she was living in this house,

00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:41.833
so the Exemption of Crimes by Family
can be applied.

00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:46.295
A lawsuit would be dismissed immediately.
Their claim is a waste of time.

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:52.718
If it happened while they lived together,

00:33:52.802 --> 00:33:53.678
you'd be correct.

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:58.933
Right. The last incident occurred
after she moved out.

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:02.728
You can sue for that one if you'd like.
How much was it again?

00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:05.439
-It's 820,000 won.
-It's for 820,000 won.

00:34:08.776 --> 00:34:09.819
Your Honor,

00:34:10.987 --> 00:34:14.532
it is true this it occurred
while she was living in that house.

00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:18.077
However, the defendant's attorney
is overlooking one aspect.

00:34:18.828 --> 00:34:21.539
Kim So-yeon, Kim Ju-won's daughter,

00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:24.792
has to avoid outside contact
as much as possible

00:34:24.876 --> 00:34:27.503
due to severe atopy and allergy symptoms.

00:34:28.212 --> 00:34:31.924
Therefore, Mr. Kim installed
a separate door on the second floor

00:34:32.008 --> 00:34:34.218
where his family lived,

00:34:34.302 --> 00:34:38.389
and strictly prevented
other family members from entering.

00:34:38.472 --> 00:34:40.975
They used a separate restroom
and living room.

00:34:41.058 --> 00:34:44.478
And, of course, living expenses
were spent separately too.

00:34:45.062 --> 00:34:50.902
Basically, he lived for free
on the second floor of his mother's house.

00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:55.031
Can you actually say
that they lived together?

00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:05.958
You are very well-prepared.

00:35:07.543 --> 00:35:08.669
But…

00:35:08.753 --> 00:35:09.962
Your Honor.

00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:15.801
Ms. Cha would like to share a few words.

00:35:16.427 --> 00:35:18.262
Okay. Go ahead.

00:35:20.681 --> 00:35:21.766
Thank you.

00:35:27.438 --> 00:35:28.564
It is all my fault.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.863
Mr. Kim Ju-won just did
what I, as CEO, told him to do.

00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:38.616
Whether it's fraud or embezzlement,

00:35:39.909 --> 00:35:41.202
just please sue me.

00:35:42.787 --> 00:35:43.996
Elijah.

00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:46.582
Is this what you wanted?

00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:50.086
To sue your mother.

00:35:55.258 --> 00:35:57.176
-Do you have a tissue?
-Tissue…

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:01.430
Right.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.811
With mothers, it doesn't matter
if they lived together or not.

00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:11.023
As she is a lineal blood relative,
she is exempt from punishment.

00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:13.567
LINEAL BLOOD RELATIVES EXEMPT
FROM PROPERTY CRIME PUNISHMENT

00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:14.986
Now, you won't waste your time.

00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:19.740
Is it a lineal blood relative this time?

00:36:19.824 --> 00:36:20.658
Yes.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.669
So, you have to sue her mother?

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:34.130
Are you giving up on the bet,
Attorney Kang?

00:36:35.464 --> 00:36:36.924
What do you mean, sir?

00:36:37.508 --> 00:36:41.304
We already took the case
from Baekseung and won. And--

00:36:41.387 --> 00:36:42.680
You got it wrong.

00:36:42.763 --> 00:36:44.265
The bet you placed

00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:48.728
was to take clients from them,
not a single case.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.941
The client who pays the legal fee
isn't that little girl, Elijah.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.568
It's EK Entertainment.

00:36:56.193 --> 00:36:57.945
I heard that girl is penniless.

00:36:58.029 --> 00:37:01.657
You're picking a fight
with the client you barely won over

00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.616
for a penniless girl?

00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:10.082
Why are you doing this now
instead of stopping me from the start?

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:11.959
-Do you think I'm that free?
-Sorry?

00:37:12.043 --> 00:37:14.754
Why would I follow up
on such a trivial case?

00:37:18.591 --> 00:37:19.675
Give up the bet.

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:23.346
Disband the team quietly as promised.

00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:24.430
Do I have your word?

00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:29.185
-You're dismissed.
-No, Dr. Oh--

00:37:44.575 --> 00:37:45.576
Still,

00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:48.913
it'll be very beneficial for us if we win.

00:37:48.996 --> 00:37:50.831
We can take cases of other celebrities

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:52.666
who have been mistreated
by their agencies.

00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:54.502
Okay.

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:55.544
Is this

00:37:56.212 --> 00:38:00.049
the new Oh & Partners you wanted to make?

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.095
Korea's punching bag?
A law firm for filial impiety?

00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:10.893
Or did you empathize too much?

00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:15.439
Did you relate to the daughter
who wants to drive away her mother?

00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:19.568
I'm disappointed.

00:38:20.444 --> 00:38:22.321
I thought you resembled me.

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:25.032
But I was wrong.

00:38:26.075 --> 00:38:28.494
Stop that lawsuit at once.

00:38:28.577 --> 00:38:29.954
And break up the team.

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:36.961
Two number 4 desks.
One 4.5-foot desk.

00:38:37.044 --> 00:38:38.087
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.922
What are you doing?

00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:41.841
I was told to take out all the desks.

00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:43.092
-What?
-What?

00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:44.802
Really?

00:38:44.885 --> 00:38:46.178
Yes, really.

00:38:48.973 --> 00:38:50.057
Mr. Kang.

00:38:50.933 --> 00:38:54.645
Is our team really going to get disbanded
if we proceed with this lawsuit?

00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:59.316
This darn firm won't let us
represent the weak.

00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:04.655
Well…

00:39:05.781 --> 00:39:08.826
It's been bothering me from the start.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.494
This isn't right.

00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:13.747
Honestly, this isn't a pro bono case.

00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:15.916
Frankly, a celebrity isn't
socially underprivileged.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.587
She's isolated and can't trust
her mother, brother, and company.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.590
Didn't we become pro bono attorneys
to help someone like her?

00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:25.593
If I get fired,
I'll become a dismissed worker too.

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:31.265
Is wanting to keep my job a crime too?

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:36.812
Am I the only jerk here again?

00:39:38.022 --> 00:39:39.899
I'm desperate too!

00:39:40.441 --> 00:39:41.484
Jun-u.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.165
What are you trying to do?

00:39:58.125 --> 00:40:00.211
You really want to get disbanded
after this case?

00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:01.712
If we quit,

00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:04.590
we become the team
that ran away after coaxing

00:40:04.673 --> 00:40:06.675
Korea's sweetheart to sue her mother.

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:08.344
The worst piece of trash team in Korea.

00:40:08.427 --> 00:40:09.929
And you're their captain.

00:40:14.558 --> 00:40:16.769
What do you want to do, Captain?

00:40:23.817 --> 00:40:24.985
Fuck.

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:37.331
Ji-hye.

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:39.291
Shall we go in, Ji-hye?

00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.293
Be careful.

00:40:43.295 --> 00:40:44.838
Elijah.

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:48.008
She was constantly asking me
to come see you

00:40:48.092 --> 00:40:51.178
because she was worried about you.

00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:55.766
I bought your favorite, strawberries.

00:41:01.522 --> 00:41:02.773
But you have it hard too.

00:41:04.858 --> 00:41:06.193
Ji-hye!

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:07.987
Ji-hye?

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:11.949
Ji-hye, is something bothering you?

00:41:14.618 --> 00:41:16.370
Should we sit for a moment?

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:20.124
-Let me see.
-Okay.

00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:24.503
Ji-hye!

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:28.799
Ji-hye.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.179
Who did this to you?

00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:45.316
Yeong-sil!

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:54.783
How did it go?

00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:03.334
Ji-hye's case didn't go well?

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.050
They can't punish Ji-hye's uncle either?

00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:14.553
He'll only get a slap on the wrist
for the assault.

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:17.973
The charge of embezzling
the death benefits of Ji-hye's parents

00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:20.809
was dismissed
without even an investigation.

00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:25.147
I had begged them to investigate it
because there's a civil suit too.

00:42:27.524 --> 00:42:28.525
What kind of law is this?

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:30.569
So it's okay to steal if you're family?

00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:34.615
That's why some people took their cases
to the Constitutional Court.

00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:38.202
But it was ruled constitutional
about a decade ago.

00:42:43.582 --> 00:42:45.584
Then, are we all out of options now?

00:42:45.668 --> 00:42:46.835
For both Ji-hye and me?

00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:50.339
At a legal level, that's correct.

00:42:52.299 --> 00:42:53.759
Is this right?

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:56.929
You're attorneys.

00:42:57.513 --> 00:42:58.847
Is the law always correct?

00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:02.559
You can do anything you want
if you're family?

00:43:10.818 --> 00:43:12.194
No, you can't.

00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:15.406
Elijah.

00:43:17.282 --> 00:43:19.993
Actually, I ran away from home
before you ran from yours.

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:23.497
I left my home when I was in high school.

00:43:24.873 --> 00:43:27.042
Wait. You never mentioned that before.

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:28.502
It's not a pleasant story.

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:32.214
My father ran a big business.

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:35.050
He had two wives.

00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:35.968
The problem was

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.097
my mother was the second one.

00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:43.767
Yeong-sil.

00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:46.937
Father came home once a week.

00:43:48.647 --> 00:43:50.858
But he didn't like me at all.

00:43:50.941 --> 00:43:52.776
I stuttered

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.611
every time I saw him

00:43:55.529 --> 00:43:56.780
because I was so nervous.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.701
I still stutter
when I get even a little nervous.

00:44:00.784 --> 00:44:02.119
Like right now…

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:05.789
I stutter.

00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:11.462
How can I be an attorney
when I'm like this?

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:13.672
It's funny, isn't it?

00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:18.719
Is that why you stayed quiet?

00:44:18.802 --> 00:44:21.221
Whenever I stuttered,

00:44:21.305 --> 00:44:24.641
Father would beat me so badly.

00:44:26.518 --> 00:44:28.228
He said it was the only way to cure it.

00:44:28.854 --> 00:44:30.314
Up until high school,

00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:35.277
I was beaten every week.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.071
Now, I'm certain of it.

00:44:38.155 --> 00:44:38.989
That…

00:44:40.157 --> 00:44:43.202
That was a crime.

00:44:44.077 --> 00:44:46.371
We can't cover up crimes

00:44:47.247 --> 00:44:49.208
in the name of family anymore.

00:44:50.959 --> 00:44:52.169
Mr. Kang.

00:44:52.878 --> 00:44:55.881
We have to do something.

00:45:02.387 --> 00:45:03.222
Mr. Jang.

00:45:07.184 --> 00:45:09.645
This time, it's a totally different case.

00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:12.981
The Exemption of Crimes by Family
has existed as a legal provision

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:15.776
since the establishment
of the Constitution in 1953.

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:19.905
It was already ruled constitutional
in 2012 at the Constitutional Court.

00:45:19.988 --> 00:45:22.824
It might also provoke public outrage.

00:45:22.908 --> 00:45:24.952
-And--
-Use me.

00:45:26.995 --> 00:45:27.871
Sorry?

00:45:27.955 --> 00:45:30.666
Think of how many people out there
are like Ji-hye.

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:34.836
I'm a celebrity who makes a living
off of people's attention.

00:45:35.837 --> 00:45:40.759
Use me to show the world
that people like Ji-hye exist.

00:45:41.385 --> 00:45:43.637
People are being oppressed
in the name of family,

00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:47.057
and they're not protected by the law.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.600
Elijah.

00:45:48.684 --> 00:45:50.936
What if we gather the victims
of family property crimes

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:52.563
and file a lawsuit together?

00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:54.231
I'll pay for all of it.

00:45:55.357 --> 00:45:57.234
Including Ji-hye's too, of course.

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:04.241
We appreciate it,

00:46:06.118 --> 00:46:07.035
but you can't.

00:46:07.786 --> 00:46:09.079
-What?
-Why not?

00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:11.248
Because…

00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:16.670
that's a job
for us pro bono attorneys to do.

00:46:20.132 --> 00:46:21.425
Right, Mr. Kang?

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.347
The team is on the verge
of being disbanded.

00:46:27.431 --> 00:46:29.308
You want to take on a fight

00:46:29.391 --> 00:46:33.520
where we have a low chance of winning
and a high chance of being denounced?

00:46:33.604 --> 00:46:35.230
Yes!

00:46:35.314 --> 00:46:38.275
That's what pro bono attorneys do.

00:46:45.198 --> 00:46:47.284
Do you all really feel the same?

00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:50.954
Really?

00:47:06.345 --> 00:47:08.180
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

00:47:13.393 --> 00:47:16.104
I have to keep my promise to you, Mom.

00:47:16.188 --> 00:47:17.439
What should I do?

00:47:18.774 --> 00:47:22.444
I've become entangled with clueless fools.

00:47:27.157 --> 00:47:29.701
You haven't dropped the lawsuit yet.

00:47:30.285 --> 00:47:32.204
Are you disobeying me?

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:35.624
Are you saying,

00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:38.293
"I'm still the CEO here"?

00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:39.252
Is that it?

00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:43.924
Call a partners' meeting

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.760
to discuss a replacement for CEO.

00:47:47.886 --> 00:47:49.179
Yes, Father.

00:47:53.308 --> 00:47:54.393
But before I do that,

00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.853
please take a look at this.

00:47:57.854 --> 00:47:59.022
What is this?

00:47:59.606 --> 00:48:02.192
It's a recording transcript
made by Ms. Seo, who you fired.

00:48:02.776 --> 00:48:06.196
It's what you discussed on the phone
regarding the appeal case

00:48:06.279 --> 00:48:07.531
of CEO Jang Hyeon-bae.

00:48:09.074 --> 00:48:10.450
With someone in the Supreme Court.

00:48:10.534 --> 00:48:12.994
-What are you doing?
-What are you going to do?

00:48:13.078 --> 00:48:16.456
An alleged trial rigging
could be fatal to our firm.

00:48:18.291 --> 00:48:20.711
If the senior attorneys
find out about this transcript,

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.922
there will be quite a disturbance.

00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:27.801
Did you set a trap?

00:48:30.345 --> 00:48:31.346
No way.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.473
Ms. Seo came to me,

00:48:33.557 --> 00:48:35.475
crying and saying it was unfair.

00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:38.812
You fired her mercilessly in front of me.

00:48:41.773 --> 00:48:42.774
Don't be ridiculous.

00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:45.402
You probably bought her off in advance.

00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.283
If I did,

00:48:52.117 --> 00:48:53.618
I must've learned it from you.

00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:57.497
"There is no one in the world
without a weakness."

00:48:58.331 --> 00:49:00.625
"If such a person does exist,

00:49:01.918 --> 00:49:04.629
plant a weakness."

00:49:13.764 --> 00:49:15.098
I'm impressed.

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:18.643
Okay.

00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:23.273
I'll watch your childish game
a little longer.

00:49:39.164 --> 00:49:41.625
TRANSCRIPT

00:49:58.266 --> 00:49:59.518
Hey, Jung-in.

00:49:59.601 --> 00:50:00.560
Let's do it.

00:50:01.186 --> 00:50:03.355
Did you persuade Dr. Oh?

00:50:03.438 --> 00:50:04.564
Persuade?

00:50:05.065 --> 00:50:08.235
If you lose, it'll be over
for both me and you.

00:50:26.086 --> 00:50:26.920
Mr. Kang!

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.799
My motto has always been,

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:34.594
"Don't start a fight you can't win."

00:50:37.138 --> 00:50:38.557
But I can't do that this time…

00:50:41.268 --> 00:50:42.811
because of some clueless fools.

00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:44.896
Mr. Kang, then that means…

00:50:47.816 --> 00:50:48.650
Let's go.

00:50:48.733 --> 00:50:51.403
-Really?
-To the Constitutional Court?

00:50:51.486 --> 00:50:52.779
That would take forever.

00:50:52.863 --> 00:50:54.364
Then, where do you want to go?

00:50:54.447 --> 00:50:56.575
I looked into the Constitutional Court,

00:50:56.658 --> 00:50:58.702
and another constitutional complaint
had been filed.

00:50:58.785 --> 00:51:00.704
It's been a while,
but it hasn't gotten far.

00:51:01.413 --> 00:51:02.873
It hasn't been getting attention.

00:51:02.956 --> 00:51:07.043
Let's make it so we get all the attention.

00:51:07.127 --> 00:51:08.211
Because we have

00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:10.505
a star.

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:12.090
No way!

00:51:12.173 --> 00:51:14.259
A street concert to urge
an unconstitutional ruling?

00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:15.552
That's attention seeking.

00:51:15.635 --> 00:51:17.888
-Then what?
-Change the law?

00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:20.181
The biggest stage would be…

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.434
Yeouido.

00:51:28.565 --> 00:51:30.358
Let's go to the National Assembly

00:51:30.442 --> 00:51:32.569
to change an unjust law.

00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:34.905
Yes!

00:51:34.988 --> 00:51:35.989
Let's go!

00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:44.205
You can sit this out if you want.
I'll talk to Oh Jung-in--

00:51:44.289 --> 00:51:45.290
It's okay.

00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.543
It's the majority's decision,

00:51:49.169 --> 00:51:50.337
so I should follow it.

00:51:52.172 --> 00:51:53.089
Jun-u.

00:51:53.173 --> 00:51:55.675
I'll do my job as a part of the team.

00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:58.345
Please do your job as well, Mr. Kang.

00:51:59.012 --> 00:51:59.930
Promise me

00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:02.641
you'll win it.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.993
Popular singer Elijah

00:52:22.077 --> 00:52:24.704
was selected as a witness
for the Assembly's government audit,

00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:26.373
garnering significant attention.

00:52:26.456 --> 00:52:28.124
All eyes are on Elijah to see

00:52:28.208 --> 00:52:31.336
if she will testify before the Assembly
about allegations of embezzlement

00:52:31.419 --> 00:52:33.213
against her mother.

00:52:33.838 --> 00:52:36.174
Elijah has already
sparked intense interest

00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:39.219
in property crimes among family
with her recent lawsuit

00:52:39.302 --> 00:52:41.763
against Cha Jin-hui,
her mother and the CEO of her agency,

00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:44.057
to terminate her exclusive contract.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.102
Hey, all the Assembly members are excited.

00:52:47.185 --> 00:52:49.729
It's their chance to get a close-up
on network news.

00:52:49.813 --> 00:52:50.730
Is that so?

00:52:50.814 --> 00:52:52.941
All the beauty salons in Yeouido
are fully booked.

00:52:53.024 --> 00:52:56.069
I heard they unanimously
selected her as a witness.

00:52:56.152 --> 00:52:58.488
It's nice to be a celebrity
in times like this.

00:53:02.158 --> 00:53:04.577
CHA HOLDING PRESS CONFERENCE,
PREPARE TO RESPOND

00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:06.413
-What on earth?
-What?

00:53:06.496 --> 00:53:07.831
Is there something going on?

00:53:08.456 --> 00:53:09.374
Hey.

00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:12.335
-Take a look.
-What is it?

00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:14.379
Breaking news.

00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:16.840
As top star Elijah's
expected attendance tomorrow

00:53:16.923 --> 00:53:19.300
at the National Assembly
draws attention across the country,

00:53:19.384 --> 00:53:21.720
her mother, CEO Cha Jin-hui,

00:53:21.803 --> 00:53:24.305
opened an emergency press conference
moments ago.

00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:26.891
Woo Myeong-hun, that prick.

00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:31.688
Just blame me.

00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:33.148
I'm a bad…

00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:39.154
I'm a bad mother.

00:53:41.823 --> 00:53:44.951
Ms. Cha's deep maternal love,
as you can see,

00:53:45.035 --> 00:53:47.370
was the cause of everything.

00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:50.415
What do you mean by this?

00:53:57.505 --> 00:53:58.715
My daughter…

00:54:01.176 --> 00:54:05.180
left home and abandoned me
because of a guy.

00:54:05.847 --> 00:54:10.685
And she filed a lawsuit
against me right away.

00:54:10.769 --> 00:54:14.939
She's accusing her mother
of embezzlement and theft.

00:54:16.816 --> 00:54:20.653
This is just killing me.

00:54:22.864 --> 00:54:24.699
Use this, Ms. Cha.

00:54:27.452 --> 00:54:30.121
These days, there's a term called "MOW."

00:54:30.205 --> 00:54:34.000
It means a "man-obsessed…"

00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:37.212
Something like that.
To put it nicely,

00:54:37.295 --> 00:54:39.297
they've lost their minds over love.

00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:41.883
Isn't it true Ms. Cha admitted

00:54:41.966 --> 00:54:44.719
to all embezzlement charges
in civil court,

00:54:44.803 --> 00:54:47.305
but wasn't investigated
due to Exemption of Crimes by Family?

00:54:53.228 --> 00:54:56.064
Ms. Cha, we have no choice.

00:54:56.147 --> 00:54:59.776
Please tell the truth about this matter.

00:54:59.859 --> 00:55:01.402
Mr. Woo, you're so cruel.

00:55:01.486 --> 00:55:05.907
How could you ask me to say that myself?

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:13.540
I will say it on her behalf then.

00:55:13.623 --> 00:55:14.499
Ms. Cha…

00:55:14.582 --> 00:55:17.919
No, Cha Jin-hui,
who is a mother before being a CEO,

00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:21.965
made a false confession
to take all the blame for the embezzlement

00:55:22.048 --> 00:55:23.842
that her son committed by himself

00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:26.136
and said she did it all.

00:55:26.219 --> 00:55:27.679
What are you talking about?

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.514
Mom.

00:55:30.807 --> 00:55:31.808
You know that's not true.

00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:40.775
Mom?

00:55:42.152 --> 00:55:44.028
-Ms. Cha!
-Ms. Cha!

00:55:44.112 --> 00:55:45.655
I have a question!

00:55:45.738 --> 00:55:46.656
What?

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:47.907
Did you see?

00:55:49.075 --> 00:55:50.535
This is what a mother is.

00:55:51.244 --> 00:55:53.705
Someone who embraces
all her children's faults as her own.

00:55:53.788 --> 00:55:57.292
That's what mothers do. But…

00:55:57.876 --> 00:56:00.253
But Elijah,
the so-called "Korea's daughter,"

00:56:00.336 --> 00:56:01.713
wants to send her mother to jail--

00:56:01.796 --> 00:56:04.257
I'm shocked.
How can she do that to her mom?

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.885
But a mother can't dump
her adult daughter's boyfriend.

00:56:06.968 --> 00:56:08.928
I'm afraid my daughter will do that.

00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:11.890
She's not Korea's sweetheart.
She's Korea's unfilial girl.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:24.944
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

00:56:25.028 --> 00:56:27.822
Top star Elijah will arrive shortly
for the Assembly's…

00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:29.157
Lies every time she speaks.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.366
WE LOVE YOU, ELIJAH

00:56:30.992 --> 00:56:34.370
Her detractors and her fans have gathered
in front of the National Assembly.

00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:39.167
And they have been aggressively
expressing their respective opinions.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:40.752
What are we going to do with her?

00:56:40.835 --> 00:56:42.378
Elijah is here!

00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:43.504
Elijah!

00:56:49.719 --> 00:56:51.512
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

00:56:53.556 --> 00:56:54.557
-We object!
-We object!

00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:56.476
Are you okay?

00:56:57.352 --> 00:56:58.228
Are you all right?

00:56:58.311 --> 00:56:59.479
Let's just go.

00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:07.695
GOVERNMENT AUDIT
FOR CRIMINAL ACT AND SYSTEM REFORM

00:57:09.405 --> 00:57:11.783
After the press conference yesterday,

00:57:11.866 --> 00:57:14.953
we also chose Ms. Cha Jin-hui

00:57:15.036 --> 00:57:17.413
as a witness for the sake of fairness.

00:57:17.914 --> 00:57:19.958
Are the counsels for both parties present?

00:57:20.041 --> 00:57:22.210
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:57:22.293 --> 00:57:25.213
Honorable Chairman, with your permission,

00:57:25.296 --> 00:57:28.007
would it be okay
if Ms. Cha Jin-hui could say a few words

00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:31.761
before Elijah makes her witness statement?

00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.931
Sure. Go ahead.

00:57:35.014 --> 00:57:35.932
Thank you.

00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:38.268
Thank you.

00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:40.186
To the honorable members of the Assembly,

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:46.359
this foolish mother
would like to ask a shameless favor.

00:57:46.442 --> 00:57:49.320
My daughter was traumatized by her father

00:57:49.404 --> 00:57:51.281
who yelled and got angry
when she was young,

00:57:51.364 --> 00:57:54.867
so she gets severely upset
in similar situations.

00:57:55.451 --> 00:57:56.953
I know this is a serious setting,

00:57:57.036 --> 00:58:00.248
but I sincerely request
that you ask her questions

00:58:00.331 --> 00:58:02.584
in the softest way possible.

00:58:05.044 --> 00:58:08.381
Even in a situation like this,
you still worry about your daughter.

00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:11.467
Because I'm her mother.

00:58:12.135 --> 00:58:17.015
Even if she stabs me in the heart
and steals everything from me,

00:58:17.724 --> 00:58:21.603
a mother still hopes
her child does not trip

00:58:21.686 --> 00:58:23.229
on her way out.

00:58:25.231 --> 00:58:26.524
We'll keep that in mind.

00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:30.028
I ask the Assembly members
to be extra careful.

00:58:30.111 --> 00:58:34.824
Okay, then. Ms. Elijah,
please come stand at the witness podium.

00:58:34.907 --> 00:58:36.200
Yes, sir.

00:58:45.126 --> 00:58:47.920
Ms. Elijah,
we will refer to you as Witness.

00:58:48.004 --> 00:58:49.213
Yes, sir.

00:58:49.297 --> 00:58:51.883
Did you see
the press conference yesterday?

00:58:52.759 --> 00:58:55.678
-Yes.
-Was what she said true?

00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:03.061
Some of it was true,
but some of it wasn't.

00:59:03.144 --> 00:59:05.313
Which part was true?

00:59:12.362 --> 00:59:13.738
When I was young,

00:59:15.698 --> 00:59:17.700
my father did break stuff in the house

00:59:18.826 --> 00:59:21.496
without any reason whenever he was drunk.

00:59:22.497 --> 00:59:23.998
Every time he did that,

00:59:24.999 --> 00:59:27.335
my mother hugged
and protected us with her whole body.

00:59:28.628 --> 00:59:31.464
Then, she divorced our father for us

00:59:32.256 --> 00:59:34.133
and struggled to make ends meet.

00:59:34.717 --> 00:59:35.802
That's all true.

00:59:38.346 --> 00:59:40.640
Honorable Assemblyman Kim Jun-pyo,

00:59:40.723 --> 00:59:44.227
could you ask
the witness, Elijah, a question?

00:59:45.645 --> 00:59:48.189
-You can ask her yourself.
-Thank you.

00:59:50.274 --> 00:59:51.234
Witness.

00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:53.319
Yes?

00:59:53.403 --> 00:59:56.698
You know a constitutional complaint
on the Exemption of Crimes by Family

00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.450
is in progress. Correct?

01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:01.035
Yes.

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:04.080
Did you come here to form public opinion

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:08.292
to influence that constitutional trial?

01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:10.962
That is right.

01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.256
So in the end,

01:00:13.339 --> 01:00:16.384
you're trying to change the law
so that your mother,

01:00:16.467 --> 01:00:19.762
who struggled to raise you,
will be punished criminally.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.264
Correct?

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.444
Yes, that is correct.

01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:39.073
That is all.

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:40.199
Thank you, Assemblyman.

01:00:41.784 --> 01:00:45.830
I think this actually shows why we need
the Exemption of Crimes by Family.

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:47.498
I think the witness has shown us proof

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:51.085
that a family can be maintained

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.296
when there's a limit
preventing parents and children

01:00:53.379 --> 01:00:56.090
from suing each other
over property issues.

01:00:57.467 --> 01:00:58.551
Isn't that so, Witness?

01:01:01.512 --> 01:01:02.638
Witness?

01:01:03.806 --> 01:01:04.932
Sir.

01:01:05.641 --> 01:01:08.853
I'm Witness Elijah's attorney,
Kang Da-wit.

01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:10.855
May I say a few words?

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:13.024
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

01:01:19.781 --> 01:01:20.615
Ms. Cha.

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:25.870
You know how smart and brilliant
your daughter is, don't you?

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:29.248
Don't you see why
such a smart person for all that time

01:01:29.332 --> 01:01:31.834
did everything her mother told her to do,

01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:34.337
signed every contract
her mother handed her,

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.547
and didn't ask or complain

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:39.342
about whether she was being properly paid?

01:01:41.052 --> 01:01:44.096
-Don't you get it?
-What are you talking about right now?

01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:47.809
Did you think she really had no idea?

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:55.817
Am I supposed to answer that?

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.610
No, just answer what you can.

01:01:58.694 --> 01:02:00.822
Do you really think she didn't know?

01:02:05.952 --> 01:02:06.828
Ms. Elijah.

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:13.167
You endured everything
despite knowing all along, didn't you?

01:02:16.754 --> 01:02:18.589
You were grateful
for how she protected you

01:02:18.673 --> 01:02:20.258
when you were young.

01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:22.134
Despite knowing all along,

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:25.137
you endured it.

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:27.765
Correct?

01:02:46.826 --> 01:02:51.581
No matter how hard you try to hide it,
the truth is bound to be revealed.

01:02:51.664 --> 01:02:54.333
It's because there are people

01:02:55.084 --> 01:02:56.878
who genuinely care about the witness.

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:03.718
Even within EK Entertainment,

01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:08.598
do you know many people
are truly worried about you, Ms. Cha?

01:03:08.681 --> 01:03:12.310
And your love for luxury brands
and your extravagant taste?

01:03:14.645 --> 01:03:17.231
What are you talking about?

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:19.817
This is the hallowed National Assembly.

01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:22.069
On what grounds,
are you making these claims--

01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:24.697
Under whose name
is the Seongsu-dong apartment you bought

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.616
with the money you stole from Elijah?

01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:29.368
Wait a minute.

01:03:29.452 --> 01:03:31.329
Wait. What are you talking about?

01:03:31.412 --> 01:03:34.206
Can he say whatever he likes
because he's an attorney?

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.876
Ms. Cha, please calm down.

01:03:36.959 --> 01:03:39.629
Counselors, are you two here to fight?

01:03:40.504 --> 01:03:43.090
This is a place
for explaining, listening, and asking.

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:45.593
Please be careful.

01:03:45.676 --> 01:03:47.386
Okay. Please continue, Counsel.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:50.848
Sir, we have one more key witness present.

01:03:50.932 --> 01:03:51.974
May they come in?

01:03:54.644 --> 01:03:56.270
I will allow it. Let them in.

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:58.314
-Thank you, sir. Mr. Hwang?
-Who's the witness?

01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:03.611
-Can they do that?
-No. Usually, they can't.

01:04:13.245 --> 01:04:15.331
Not you. You do it.

01:04:19.835 --> 01:04:22.755
Chairman, may he come stand at the podium?

01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:24.298
Yes.

01:04:25.508 --> 01:04:26.550
Elijah.

01:04:33.516 --> 01:04:34.558
Mr. Kang Min-ha.

01:04:36.143 --> 01:04:39.063
You're a sales associate for VIPs

01:04:39.146 --> 01:04:42.525
at a luxury brand store
in Cheongdam-dong. Correct?

01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:44.485
Yes, that's correct.

01:04:45.111 --> 01:04:49.615
Could you tell us who bought you
the apartment you are living in?

01:04:52.284 --> 01:04:55.413
Yes. It was Ms. Cha
who is sitting right here.

01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:08.134
I'm sorry, but may I see
the company card you carry?

01:05:08.843 --> 01:05:09.677
Yes.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.180
Gosh, it's a black card!

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.351
Goodness. Which company's card is this?

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:19.812
I heard this card
has a really high credit limit.

01:05:20.396 --> 01:05:22.314
It belongs to EK Entertainment's CEO.

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:27.278
My goodness. Oh, dear.

01:05:27.361 --> 01:05:29.071
The Exemption of Crimes by Family

01:05:29.155 --> 01:05:31.949
doesn't apply
to embezzlement of corporate funds.

01:05:32.033 --> 01:05:35.244
It's not true. He's lying.

01:05:35.327 --> 01:05:36.620
I don't remember that card.

01:05:36.704 --> 01:05:38.372
And I don't even know who he is.

01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:42.168
I see. I didn't know
you were generous enough

01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:45.713
to give this to a total stranger.

01:05:45.796 --> 01:05:46.881
I understand.

01:05:47.882 --> 01:05:51.260
Mr. Kang, why did Ms. Cha
offer these to you?

01:05:57.558 --> 01:05:59.977
This is embarrassing to say,

01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:02.438
but she said she liked me.

01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:10.362
Okay, all right.

01:06:16.118 --> 01:06:17.369
That ungrateful child.

01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:20.414
I made her a star.

01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:24.168
She's a nobody who thinks she became
a success because she's special.

01:06:34.762 --> 01:06:37.223
I'm going to live for myself from now on…

01:06:39.475 --> 01:06:40.392
with you

01:06:41.936 --> 01:06:42.812
while having fun.

01:06:44.647 --> 01:06:45.815
Chairman.

01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:49.318
These days, there's a term called "MOW."

01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:51.445
Pardon? MO…

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:53.322
It's a "man-obsessed…"

01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:59.954
Something like that. To put it nicely,
they've lost their minds over love.

01:07:00.037 --> 01:07:01.372
Kang Da-wit, that crazy…

01:07:02.373 --> 01:07:04.667
Mr. Kang, it must've been
a difficult decision

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:08.170
to go against a big sugar mama… Sorry.

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:10.131
To go against someone
you're so grateful to.

01:07:10.214 --> 01:07:14.009
What made you decide
to disclose the truth?

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:17.304
What? It's because you said

01:07:17.388 --> 01:07:18.806
you'd try me as an accomplice…

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.230
Isn't there another reason?

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:30.109
Right. Well…

01:07:30.693 --> 01:07:32.987
The apartment Ms. Cha gave me

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:35.197
turned out to be pretty run-down.

01:07:35.281 --> 01:07:37.533
It's worthless with a full mortgage.

01:07:37.616 --> 01:07:38.951
No, this is a fabrication!

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:40.870
Who on earth are you?

01:07:40.953 --> 01:07:42.705
Witness, she says she doesn't know you.

01:07:42.788 --> 01:07:46.959
-If you commit perjury, you'll be--
-Ms. Cha, I seriously trusted you.

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:51.005
But she gave the real deal
to a top host bar guy.

01:07:51.088 --> 01:07:54.049
-How could you…
-This is slander, sir!

01:07:54.133 --> 01:07:57.553
-How can love change?
-Calm down!

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:00.848
Calm down. This is not a court.

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:04.435
Both Counsels, that is enough.

01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:08.314
We'll resume after taking a short break.

01:08:11.317 --> 01:08:13.485
Elijah, drink some water.

01:08:18.699 --> 01:08:20.242
You did great, Mr. Kang.

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:24.079
Now, you can say
what you've really wanted to say.

01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:25.164
Everything is set.

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:28.000
Okay.

01:08:29.043 --> 01:08:30.336
Mr. Jang!

01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:31.754
Elijah.

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:33.422
Hi, Elijah.

01:08:33.505 --> 01:08:34.673
Hi, Ji-hye!

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:41.555
-Thank you, Mr. Jang.
-It's nothing.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:44.141
-Good luck, Elijah!
-Good luck!

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:48.520
You can do it.

01:08:52.858 --> 01:08:54.276
How did my mother and I…

01:08:58.239 --> 01:08:59.949
end up like this?

01:09:02.368 --> 01:09:04.536
She was such a good mother
when I was young.

01:09:08.958 --> 01:09:10.834
Was it the money?

01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:13.337
Maybe.

01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:18.425
Our family had never
laid hands on that kind of money,

01:09:18.509 --> 01:09:20.552
and when it started pouring in,

01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:23.180
I think it all started then.

01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:26.433
Honestly,

01:09:26.517 --> 01:09:28.978
I didn't want to go this far
and fight with my mom.

01:09:29.853 --> 01:09:30.729
Money?

01:09:30.813 --> 01:09:33.482
I didn't care if I gave it all to her.

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:38.904
All I wanted

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.448
was freedom.

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:48.205
I didn't want to live my whole life
as her ATM machine.

01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:50.791
If I could somehow
get the exclusive contract terminated,

01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:53.877
I was going to leave.

01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:57.131
But…

01:10:02.303 --> 01:10:03.304
Elijah.

01:10:10.144 --> 01:10:12.021
When I met Ji-hye over there,

01:10:13.439 --> 01:10:17.067
I realized it was not just about me.

01:10:18.193 --> 01:10:20.195
Not only did Ji-hye's uncle and his wife

01:10:20.279 --> 01:10:22.781
embezzle their niece's disability pension,

01:10:23.615 --> 01:10:27.411
but they also still kicked her out
into the streets to beg to make money.

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:30.789
If she didn't make enough money,
they'd beat her.

01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.418
It's sad, but sometimes,

01:10:35.586 --> 01:10:39.089
family can be the assailant
who's the closest to you.

01:10:41.425 --> 01:10:43.844
Is she talking about me as the assailant?

01:10:44.595 --> 01:10:45.721
Just listen.

01:10:48.974 --> 01:10:50.601
Could you stand for a moment?

01:10:52.811 --> 01:10:53.854
Ji-hye.

01:10:57.566 --> 01:11:02.279
They are the members of my fan club
and victims of family property crimes

01:11:02.363 --> 01:11:04.865
who have gathered here,
thanks to pro bono attorneys.

01:11:05.366 --> 01:11:09.078
An elderly man whose entire fortune
was stolen by his child.

01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:12.289
A boy whose inheritance from his mom
was stolen by his stepdad.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:15.918
A person with a physical disability

01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:19.088
who couldn't stop her brother
from taking her money.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.924
I'm embarrassed to say

01:11:23.217 --> 01:11:25.219
I've received more love than I deserve,

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:28.347
but I haven't taken
full responsibility for it.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:33.769
I simply exist because you care
and show interest in me.

01:11:34.353 --> 01:11:37.356
The only way to repay this love
is to become a tool

01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:39.149
to help tell the world

01:11:39.233 --> 01:11:41.110
about the suffering people endure

01:11:41.193 --> 01:11:43.862
that hasn't received attention
but needs to be known.

01:11:45.864 --> 01:11:48.659
Please help them to ease their pain

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:54.248
and the injustice they feel when the law
and their families don't protect them.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.750
Elijah.

01:12:00.671 --> 01:12:04.341
The Exemption of Crimes by Family
has existed since ancient Rome.

01:12:04.425 --> 01:12:07.594
The famous saying goes, "The law stops
at the doorstep of the house."

01:12:07.678 --> 01:12:10.097
It's a custom that's very old.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.265
And in Korea,

01:12:11.348 --> 01:12:14.226
the law hasn't changed for over 70 years
since it was established.

01:12:14.309 --> 01:12:18.647
Legal stability is a value
that is as important as,

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:22.734
or even more important than,
specific validity.

01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:25.154
Yes, you are right.

01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:29.700
Legal stability.
That's an important value.

01:12:29.783 --> 01:12:34.705
But, sir, if it hasn't changed
for over 70 years,

01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:37.416
couldn't that also mean

01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:42.754
some have been suffering
for over 70 years?

01:12:44.756 --> 01:12:47.134
If the law stops
at the doorstep of the house,

01:12:47.217 --> 01:12:52.347
brutal, lawless chaos
unfolds behind that door.

01:12:52.973 --> 01:12:55.225
Honorable members of the Assembly,

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.898
the law should change
along with the changing times.

01:13:01.607 --> 01:13:04.318
I believe it is the noble duty
of the National Assembly

01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:07.154
to breathe life into the law

01:13:07.237 --> 01:13:10.032
so it becomes a standard
that lives and breathes with the times,

01:13:10.532 --> 01:13:12.618
rather than a fossil trapped in the past.

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.663
Members of the Assembly,

01:13:17.998 --> 01:13:19.374
I humbly ask

01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:22.586
for your wise decision.

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:49.947
Mr. Woo.

01:13:51.615 --> 01:13:53.033
Mr. Woo.

01:13:53.116 --> 01:13:55.035
Excuse me, Mr. Woo!

01:13:57.663 --> 01:13:58.872
What do we do?

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:02.876
-We should talk to a prosecutors' office--
-Why do you keep touching me?

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.503
Are you going to say you like me too?

01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:07.631
-Mr. Woo!
-Never!

01:14:07.714 --> 01:14:10.968
I never take on clients
who don't tell me everything.

01:14:11.051 --> 01:14:12.678
Find another attorney.

01:14:14.179 --> 01:14:15.389
Wait.

01:14:15.472 --> 01:14:17.516
Wait, Mr. Woo.

01:14:17.599 --> 01:14:19.226
Come on, Mr. Woo!

01:14:19.309 --> 01:14:20.561
Wait!

01:14:20.644 --> 01:14:21.812
Hey, you!

01:14:26.608 --> 01:14:30.404
-For goodness' sake! What is it now?
-I really hate to admit it…

01:14:34.157 --> 01:14:35.951
But you were pretty cool today, Mr. Kang.

01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:40.247
Come on, now. Please.

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:42.207
That's old news.

01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:43.709
When was I ever not cool?

01:14:44.543 --> 01:14:47.045
There you go bragging again. This was why…

01:14:47.129 --> 01:14:51.008
But how will it go?
Will we be able to win?

01:14:52.926 --> 01:14:55.679
We don't know. We might lose.

01:14:55.762 --> 01:14:56.805
But you know what?

01:14:57.806 --> 01:15:00.726
Even if we lose today,
it will become a stepping stone

01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:04.271
for the world to take
half a step forward tomorrow.

01:15:04.354 --> 01:15:09.067
And next time, someone will be able
to start fresh from there.

01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:12.279
Mr. Kang!

01:15:15.198 --> 01:15:16.491
I know I said it,

01:15:16.575 --> 01:15:18.869
but it was pretty cool. Do you agree?

01:15:20.329 --> 01:15:21.496
Right, Jun-u?

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.957
Of course.
You sounded unfamiliar for a moment,

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.918
but now, you sound
just like the Mr. Kang I know.

01:15:27.002 --> 01:15:28.712
-What?
-"Even if we lose,

01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:32.132
today's win will be a stepping…"

01:15:32.215 --> 01:15:33.050
Forget it.

01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:34.635
-Ms. Yoo, call me big bro now.
-Why?

01:15:34.718 --> 01:15:36.720
You're the big bro
if you're the cool one, right?

01:15:36.803 --> 01:15:38.472
-Why would I?
-"Even if we lose…"

01:15:38.555 --> 01:15:40.599
-That's what you said!
-I didn't!

01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:42.476
ONE MONTH LATER

01:15:42.559 --> 01:15:45.771
The Exemption of Crimes
by Family provision in this case

01:15:45.854 --> 01:15:48.982
uniformly exempts
a wide range of relatives

01:15:49.608 --> 01:15:53.195
from punishment for property crimes

01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.697
without considering their severity.

01:15:56.281 --> 01:15:58.950
Therefore, there is a concern

01:15:59.034 --> 01:16:02.287
it will result
in allowing financial exploitation

01:16:02.871 --> 01:16:05.499
of family members
in vulnerable positions.

01:16:05.582 --> 01:16:09.461
Therefore, the Constitutional Court,
in which all members agreed unanimously,

01:16:09.544 --> 01:16:11.421
rules the following.

01:16:12.881 --> 01:16:13.715
The Court rules

01:16:14.549 --> 01:16:18.387
Article 328, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:21.890
is hereby declared unconstitutional.

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:41.243
Today, the Constitutional Court
issued a historic ruling

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:44.746
that deemed the Exemption of Crimes
by Family as unconstitutional.

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:46.540
Now, a path has opened

01:16:46.623 --> 01:16:48.834
to protect people from the legal loophole

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:51.837
of property crimes committed
by their family members.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.547
-I'm the CEO here!
-Don't resist.

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:54.464
Oh, my gosh!

01:16:54.548 --> 01:16:56.174
Elijah.

01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:57.551
Wait. I was wrong.

01:16:57.634 --> 01:16:59.553
-Let's go.
-I was wrong.

01:16:59.636 --> 01:17:01.471
It was all a misunderstanding.

01:17:01.555 --> 01:17:02.556
Mom.

01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:05.892
Hold on. Yes, Elijah?

01:17:10.564 --> 01:17:11.857
Thank you

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.985
for bringing me into this world

01:17:15.819 --> 01:17:16.737
and raising me.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.870
Yes. My kind little Elijah.

01:17:24.953 --> 01:17:26.997
Okay, you can drop the charges now,

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.165
and we can--

01:17:28.248 --> 01:17:29.082
But, Mom…

01:17:32.377 --> 01:17:33.587
you're fired.

01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:36.673
I want you out of my life.

01:17:38.675 --> 01:17:40.218
-Let's go.
-Go.

01:17:40.302 --> 01:17:41.928
You know how hard I worked to raise you?

01:17:42.012 --> 01:17:43.388
-Stop.
-Hey, you!

01:17:43.472 --> 01:17:45.056
Damn you, bitch!

01:17:46.183 --> 01:17:48.727
I'm the one who made you a star!

01:18:25.722 --> 01:18:26.848
Excuse me.

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:30.435
Is this Team Pro Bono?

01:18:30.519 --> 01:18:33.104
Yes, it is. Who are you?

01:18:34.981 --> 01:18:37.150
The Alliance of Judicial Victims
referred me to you.

01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:39.361
They said you'd take my case.

01:18:39.444 --> 01:18:41.071
Right. They told us about you.

01:18:41.154 --> 01:18:43.615
You lost your father
due to a wrongful trial.

01:18:45.158 --> 01:18:46.034
Yes.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.371
The presiding judge abused his power

01:18:50.539 --> 01:18:53.250
and killed my father
through a manipulated trial.

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.877
What was the name of the presiding judge?

01:19:01.132 --> 01:19:02.259
Kang Da-wit.

01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:15.188
Ms. Park Gi-ppeum.

01:19:43.466 --> 01:19:45.468
I've spent the past ten years
gathering these.

01:19:45.552 --> 01:19:47.053
Trust the evidence.

01:19:47.137 --> 01:19:48.513
I don't care if I go to hell

01:19:48.597 --> 01:19:51.474
as long as I can expose
Kang Da-wit's hypocrisy.

01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:53.518
We've had a long, bitter history.

01:19:53.602 --> 01:19:56.104
About Yoo Jae-beom,
his father was the CEO.

01:19:56.187 --> 01:19:58.940
The defendant was changed by Mr. Kang.

01:19:59.024 --> 01:20:00.650
Go get Yoo Baek-man.

01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:01.860
Otherwise, I cannot proceed.

01:20:01.943 --> 01:20:03.194
It was a manipulated trial.

01:20:03.278 --> 01:20:05.906
What is happening?
CEO Jang's case was also rigged?

01:20:05.989 --> 01:20:07.365
Is Kang Da-wit out of his mind?

01:20:07.449 --> 01:20:08.700
I will take care of it.

01:20:08.783 --> 01:20:09.910
Step down.

01:20:10.493 --> 01:20:12.412
-Why don't you take the case?
-How could we…

01:20:12.495 --> 01:20:16.249
Isn't it your job to help the victims
of abuse-of-power crimes?

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:18.001
Are you really going to take my case?

01:20:18.084 --> 01:20:19.085
They all want to?

01:20:19.169 --> 01:20:20.712
Please tell us everything.

01:20:28.845 --> 01:20:30.847
