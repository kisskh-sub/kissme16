00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.020
Waiter, do you have any recommendations?

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.860
The chef's special for today is yellow curry beef brisket.

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.160
Do you two...

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.420
know each other?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.977
We do.

00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:42.240
He's my ex.

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.979
My man's got great taste in men.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.039
Ex-boyfriend.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.000
Send us five of your best dishes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.639
You pick.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.039
If nobody has dietary restrictions,

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.040
I'll get started.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.199
Don't ask.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.039
I have nothing to say.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.479
I'm almost 30.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.000
How could I not have an ex?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.479
I've got one question.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.119
How is he in bed?

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.759
They say the hotter the guy,
the lamer the skills.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.279
Jiang Hui Hui...

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.000
What did you learn all those years abroad?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.520
- None of your business.
- If not me, then who?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.839
You two bicker first.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.479
I'm stepping out for a smoke.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.960
Want one?

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.680
You used to like these.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040
Well?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.679
Not my thing.

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:23.200
Too sweet.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.839
Kinda like...

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.279
Rouge.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.879
Rouge?

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.759
Waiting for me?

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.760
What do you mean?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.519
You've been in here six minutes.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:47.920
Taking a piss or a smoke
doesn't take that long.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.119
If you're still here,

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:51.440
that means you're waiting for me.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.320
Aren't you in sales at Kangda Pharma?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.919
What's this?

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:59.558
A costume change?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.119
I'm still doing sales,

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:07.000
and I help out here sometimes.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.880
I speak Thai.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.360
They pay me better.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.799
You could carry plates all night

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:16.559
and still not afford this pack of Rouge.

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.880
President Fan, slumming it out...

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.578
What's the angle?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.079
I quit inside, too,

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.359
but after I got out,

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:29.485
I couldn't control myself.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.000
When I'm upset, I want a smoke.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.880
When I miss you, I want one, too.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.760
I tried other brands,
couldn't get used to them.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.600
This brand's pricey,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.400
so I smoke it less.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.079
Only when I miss you like crazy

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.480
do I light one.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.359
Some things aren't fit to say right now.

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:51.879
Please swallow them, President Fan.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.799
As far as I know,

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:56.440
you never went "inside," did you?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440
Six months.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.075
I was a cooperating witness.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.799
A cooperating witness with minor offenses.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:05.120
Charges weren't disclosed publicly.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.057
A cooperating witness.

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.239
During the tsunami,

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.030
they could've taken me and my mom.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.000
But they shut the car door.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.720
They wouldn't wait a second.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.440
I wanted revenge for years.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.150
Planned it for a long time.

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:28.600
To collect evidence,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.480
I did plenty of dirty things with them.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.160
Later, I worked with Thai prosecutors

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.880
and gave them firsthand info.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.119
So, once it went to court,

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.599
they converted me to a cooperating witness.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.079
I got a lighter sentence.

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:51.519
The money in the medical fund
you set up for Tian Tian,

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:54.959
the dividends from Pinfeng under your name...

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:58.480
None of that needs you juggling jobs.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.280
So, what trick are you playing now?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.000
I won't touch Tian Tian's medical money,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.479
not even if I'm broke.

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:13.440
True

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.799
I could do nothing and still live comfortably.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:20.359
But what's the point of days like that?

00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:23.040
I want to cut loose from family capital

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.560
and earn clean money to spend.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.599
I want to find something worth working for.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.440
Otherwise, I really won't last.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.320
I relied on no one.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.200
I earned this job myself.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.649
Look.

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:48.488
This is me at the company's
Outstanding Employee awards.

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:50.480
[This Season's Outstanding Employee]

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.880
In six months,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.639
I rose from field rep to regional distributor.

00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.986
Silly, right?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.239
Starting from scratch
was harder than I thought.

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:04.920
Shu Lang.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.320
You don't know.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.079
A tiny title,

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:10.000
a bonus worth a few cartons of smokes,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.211
things I used to despise...

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.168
They had me shaking with excitement.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:20.279
Offstage, everyone else
called home with the news.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:23.480
I've never had real good news,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.512
and when I finally did...

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:29.038
I didn't know who to tell.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.500
I stared at your number for over ten minutes.

00:08:39.446 --> 00:08:41.686
But I still didn't dial.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.799
I promised not to disturb your life,

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.560
so I have to keep it.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:55.529
Then please keep doing exactly that.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.320
- What's the best dish here?
- This place was so good.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.119
- I'm so full I can't walk.
- How are you getting home?

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.359
- My husband's picking me up.
- How do you expect me to eat this?

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:15.320
My car's outside. I'll drive you back.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.479
Oh, don't forget to get your parking validated.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.000
Hey, man.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:28.159
I'm talking to you.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.280
Look here.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.479
Where are you looking?

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:33.559
The hair's right here.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.039
What's left to confirm?

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:38.719
What, you think I'd frame a waiter?

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:39.799
Of course not.

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:43.280
Sorry, we'll serve up a new one right away.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.719
That's more like it.

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:46.559
You should have this attitude.

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:49.479
Here, your tip.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.890
Not picking it up?

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:00.760
Too high-and-mighty to be a waiter?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.200
You Zi, let's go.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.722
Coming.

00:10:07.722 --> 00:10:10.558
[Episode 14]

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:12.032
Shu Lang.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.649
What are you doing here?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.159
Are you watching me?

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.320
I'm not.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.039
You aren't?

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.359
I saw the dark circles
under your eyes at the restaurant.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.840
You looked like that when you weren't well.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.559
I got worried,

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:39.170
so I waited here.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.359
How long were you planning to stay here?

00:11:42.359 --> 00:11:45.159
Usually, until your lights go out.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.479
Usually?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.159
It's late, where are you going?

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:54.679
I'm fine.

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:55.679
Go.

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:58.239
You're sure you're not unwell?

00:11:58.239 --> 00:11:59.734
Don't mind me.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.039
What's going on?

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.559
Is it your stomach?

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.010
Does it hurt?

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:12.042
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.359
Fan Xiao, put me down.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.359
I'm not going to the hospital.

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:19.240
I'll just buy some meds. I'll be fine after.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.640
Fan Xiao, Tian Tian's at home. I'm worried.

00:12:34.599 --> 00:12:37.440
It always gets better after I take pills.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.719
Always?

00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:40.840
Does this happen a lot?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.604
I thought you were doing fine.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.346
I'll just go buy meds.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.960
I'll get you home now,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.945
then hit the pharmacy.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.593
So soon?

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.126
Thanks.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.840
I'll make you some congee,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840
and leave when it's done.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.084
Don't bother.

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:38.080
What do you really want?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.785
I just want to cook congee for you.

00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:42.515
I'll leave after it's done.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.531
It's ready.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.640
I'll be in the kitchen.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.719
Where's your kitchen?

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:39.359
Enter through the bedroom,
there's a small door inside.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.960
You Shu Lang...

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.959
You actually invited the wolf in again.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.200
Shu Lang, it's your birthday today.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.975
Happy birthday.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.719
But your stomach's bad,

00:15:31.719 --> 00:15:33.503
so no cake for you.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.502
Blow out a candle.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.448
Make a wish.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.104
Not making one?

00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:08.359
I don't know my real birthday.

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:10.243
And I never celebrate.

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:13.799
I know.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:16.359
Didn't we pick this date before?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.959
Does that still count?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.000
Is the congee done?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080
If it is, get out.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.039
Then I'll make a wish for you.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.799
Wishing Director You and Tian Tian

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:41.240
lasting health and happiness.

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.920
The congee's still warm.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.600
I'm leaving.

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:13.967
Get some rest.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.440
If you need me...

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.600
One call and I'll be there.

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:56.920
Xiao Tian, send me the files tonight by email.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.160
I have a video meeting
with President Huang tomorrow.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.800
Don't worry, You and I have been
updating the measurements.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.800
It's 7:30 now.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.040
We'll have it out latest by 10.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.680
- Okay.
- I won't keep you up late.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.986
Thanks.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.239
Director You, did you hear Fan Xiao
crashed and burned?

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:22.319
He's so overbearing, stepped on everyone,

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:24.319
made a ton of enemies.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:27.040
Now he's done in, can't cut it in Thailand.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.998
Tucked tail and ran.

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:32.479
I heard from third young master Bai

00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.040
that Fan Xiao went to Hua.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.520
He's going to follow Fan Xiao over.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.439
Bai Peng Yu?

00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:39.319
What's his beef with Fan Xiao?

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.000
Revenge!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.479
He's dying to get even.

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:45.959
No idea what grudge they have.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:49.160
Director You, wanna go watch the show?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.486
Didn't Fan Xiao lie to you then
and force you into things?

00:18:58.239 --> 00:18:59.959
You?

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:01.040
You?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.199
Yeah?

00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:03.760
Are you still not fully recovered?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.920
You've been off the past few days.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.680
You messed up today's
technical calculations three times.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.319
Sorry.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.880
I really haven't felt well.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.920
I'll head out first today.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.800
Zhou, Xiao Tian.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.359
Thanks for covering.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:24.040
You, you should go to the hospital.
Don't tough it out.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.079
Yeah, Xiao You.

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.680
Go get checked properly.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.479
- We've got this here.
- Yeah.

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:29.560
It's okay.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.479
A solid sleep will fix it.

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:32.607
Okay.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.199
It's almost eight. Are the buses late today?

00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.479
Why isn't one here yet?

00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:48.959
After seven, this stop only runs
every fifteen minutes.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:51.079
We probably just missed one.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:54.039
- Let's wait.
- It's coming, almost here.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.040
Director You!

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.520
I found out! 8:30 tonight at Lido Club!

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.879
Young Master Bai invited Fan Xiao.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.359
Hey, kid.

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:17.144
Gettin' on?

00:20:17.144 --> 00:20:18.516
Oh.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.239
Look, that motorcycle is so cool.

00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:37.119
Cool my foot. It's so showy.

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:38.469
And loud.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.959
Bus stop Hongyesi.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.560
Passengers who need to get off,
please get off at the back door.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.160
Please be careful when opening the door.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.000
Please be careful when getting off the vehicle.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.560
Anyone getting off?

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.720
No one? I'm driving off.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.920
Sir! Sir! Sorry, I'm getting off!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.960
Should've said so earlier.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.008
Xue Bao.

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:32.560
Sir, can you go faster?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.119
Sure.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.991
It's already 8:47.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.880
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.079
Which room is Young Master Bai's suite?

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:50.973
May I have your name, sir?

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920
Fan.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.538
Okay. One moment.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.800
All right.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.528
This way, Mr. Fan.

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:07.000
This way, Mr. Fan.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.640
It's the last private room inside.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.800
Third Young Master is waiting for you.

00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:23.492
Come on, let's give a warm welcome to Fan...

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.839
As expected, he's not here.

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:28.800
Why is it you? Where's Fan Xiao?

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.479
Third Young Master, I'm here with a friend.

00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:33.760
I heard you were here,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.199
so I came to say hi.

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:36.719
Long time no see.

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:39.176
You're still as dashing as ever.

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:47.560
Third Young Master, my friend's calling me.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.624
I won't intrude.

00:22:49.624 --> 00:22:51.096
Enjoy yourselves.

00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:57.150
You, leaving without even a drink?

00:22:58.324 --> 00:22:59.957
Fucking hell.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.680
I came back to Hua,

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.000
threw a big party to invite Fan Xiao,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.279
and he disrespects me like this?

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:10.719
You invited Fan Xiao today?

00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:11.800
Third Young Master,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.800
you also know he and I have beef.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.467
If he's coming, I'll be leaving.

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:29.450
What do you mean by this?

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.319
Fuck.

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:33.159
Nothing special.

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:35.959
You...

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:40.040
I know best about your grudge with Fan Xiao.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.479
Look, he still isn't here.

00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:45.079
Why don't you call and hurry him up?

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:46.880
When he arrives,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.560
I'll play peacemaker for you two.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.920
Third Young Master.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.040
Sorry, my gastritis is acting up.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.439
I can't drink.

00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:59.680
And I can't order Fan Xiao around.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.024
We haven't spoken in a long time.

00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:04.839
Is that so?

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:07.199
If he wants to hide like a turtle,

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:10.639
You can stay, same difference.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.399
You, why hold the door?

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:15.959
Come on, sit with me.

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:17.079
Let's have a good talk.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:21.119
Third Young Master, I'll treat you another day.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:23.026
I really have someone waiting.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.479
You think this is the kind of place

00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:32.199
where you come as you like
and leave as you please?

00:24:32.199 --> 00:24:33.479
No time like the present.

00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:35.360
Tonight it is.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.160
You set up this whole scene

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.239
and invited Fan Xiao.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.970
What do you really want?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.119
Third Young Master.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:58.359
Let's stop talking in circles.

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.920
We both know what you want.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.560
He's fallen on hard times.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.759
You want to stomp him.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.719
After what he did to me,

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:14.680
shouldn't I step on him?

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:20.359
The ways to handle someone are all the same.

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:22.680
I've been to Lido many times,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.880
but I've never been in this room.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.119
This one's not for ordinary guests.

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:29.599
You need a sponsor.

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:31.880
In a place this private,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.520
if it's just drugs and booze,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.280
that'll be too crude.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.680
So, you're going to use the pricey stuff

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.639
or mix it up?

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.599
Damn.

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:50.319
I get it now.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.520
You didn't come to greet me.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.040
You got wind of it

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.959
and came to save your sweetheart.

00:25:55.959 --> 00:25:59.599
So, you used Fan Xiao's name to get in

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:01.640
to pay his debt for him?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.359
Not pay it, no.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:08.359
But what you did to me before...

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:12.039
Doesn't it deserve a beating?

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.199
If you insist on revenge,

00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:23.546
I'll take it for Fan Xiao.

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:30.599
He treated you like dirt,

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:33.040
and you still want to take the hit for him?

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.959
You get off on being used?

00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:36.919
Addicted to being pinned down?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.439
I don't touch men

00:26:39.439 --> 00:26:42.800
or else I also need to find
someone as cheap as you.

00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:56.840
Your loss, Third Young Master.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.320
But tonight, I'm under your roof.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.159
Do whatever you want.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.640
If you don't kill me today,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.280
I'll dog you for life,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:21.816
until I collect tenfold, a hundredfold.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.519
Of course.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.639
You won't just be watched by me.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:37.399
There's Fan Xiao.

00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:40.719
Then you'll know

00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:43.640
what we really are to each other.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.040
And of course,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.399
that includes everyone here tonight.

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:52.560
You, are you threatening me?

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.000
Think I don't dare touch you?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.839
You dare, no doubt.

00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:02.963
You just don't like getting your hands dirty.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.320
I really have an appointment
with someone today.

00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:08.479
My friend is hurrying me.

00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.560
I really have to go.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.239
You, you came to say hi,

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.359
but if I let you walk so easily,

00:28:22.359 --> 00:28:25.279
that'll make me look rude, right?

00:28:29.719 --> 00:28:34.079
Last time, you had Fan Xiao beat me
for ten minutes.

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:38.199
Today, let me stretch my legs,

00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:39.479
and give you ten minutes back.

00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:40.919
How about it?

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:54.039
You alone?

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.079
Or all of you?

00:28:57.079 --> 00:29:00.520
All would make it bullying, right?

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.839
Just me.

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:04.469
And him.

00:29:15.439 --> 00:29:16.999
Fine.

00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:29.599
Wait, wait! Wait!

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:31.000
You...

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.239
You said I could hit you for ten minutes!

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:34.319
You're breaking your word!

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:36.280
Last time I hit you,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.119
I never said you couldn't fight back.

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:50.439
Shu Lang.

00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:52.119
Shu Lang, what's wrong?

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.600
Why are your hands so cold?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.079
Why didn't you answer the phone?

00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:00.119
You called me?

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:02.160
Didn't you say "One call and I'll be there"?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.640
Why was your phone off?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.880
I...

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.079
Bai kept calling me.

00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:07.359
It was annoying.

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.000
So, I shut it off for a bit.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.955
Why did you call me?

00:30:17.439 --> 00:30:19.040
Nothing.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.560
Pocket dial.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.439
You wouldn't call for no reason.

00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:24.079
It couldn't be accidental.

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:26.042
What happened?

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.079
What's wrong?

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:34.199
Shu Lang, are you unwell?

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:36.640
I just got back from the lab.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.560
I'm very tired.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.760
I want to rest early.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.560
Okay, Fan Xiao?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.359
No.

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:47.119
Bai Peng Yu kept asking to meet to talk today.

00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:49.640
It started pouring when I went.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.520
I figured you had no umbrella,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.920
so I brought one to the institute.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.480
They said you weren't well
and had gone home early.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.024
But your home stayed dark.

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:02.520
Shu Lang, what really happened?

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.319
Fan Xiao.

00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:08.160
You track me every second.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.880
How is that "not disturbing my life"?

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.319
If I'm not at the institute, I must be home?

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:16.959
I can't have a life of my own?

00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:20.280
Can't I do other things?

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.199
Like go on a date?

00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:23.920
A date?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.239
But he let you walk home in a storm?

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:27.959
What a class act.

00:31:27.959 --> 00:31:30.319
Director You, you like that?

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.919
Fan Xiao.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.640
Any man's got more class than you.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.479
I don't want to rehash the past.

00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:40.920
Before my patience runs out,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.119
just disappear.

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:44.825
I'll still find out.

00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:46.572
If it was a date...

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.999
that kind of man isn't for you.

00:31:58.015 --> 00:32:00.920
Director You, I heard Bai laid hands on you.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.199
Are you okay?

00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:04.040
I didn't mean to miss your call.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.040
Zhang Chi's punks grabbed me just now.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.556
Say that again! He hit who?

00:32:16.719 --> 00:32:18.760
Are the injuries serious?

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.000
Fan Xiao.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.839
Bai Peng Yu asked for you today

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.040
to mess you up.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.000
I wanted to see

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.080
how a devil like you gets played.

00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:34.839
It'd be a great show.

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:37.560
Thinking of it cheers me up.

00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:42.839
I know...

00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:44.999
you went to laugh at me.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.920
Go take a hot bath.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.528
Don't catch a cold.

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:56.013
I'll head out.

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:00.133
Get some rest.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.050
Fan Xiao.

00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:09.028
He got nothing out of me.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.941
Don't go after him.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.599
How could I not?

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:21.280
I figured they wanted a show,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.239
but I never thought

00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:26.839
that clown would dare touch you.

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:28.680
Since he touched you,

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.553
he'll pay the price.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.639
Fan Xiao, I'm no Bodhisattva.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.719
I've wanted revenge more than once,

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:45.159
wanted to grind you under heel,
wanted to see you suffer.

00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:47.640
But unfortunately,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.319
it can't be Bai Peng Yu.

00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:52.440
He isn't worthy.

00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:56.440
He's cut from the same cloth as you.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.560
Fan Xiao.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.880
When he called me cheap,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.479
I half believed it.

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:09.868
I've been low enough.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.840
I was a joke to others.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.560
So, I beg you,

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.239
let it go.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.169
Don't stir up more trouble.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.016
No one is worthy.

00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:38.973
Only you can take revenge on me.

00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:42.528
If hurting me helps you breathe,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.516
I'll take it gladly.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.840
You're nobody's joke.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.453
You're not.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.000
I'll do anything you say,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.827
except this.

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:02.520
No one touches you.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.520
If they do,

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.719
they pay.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.730
I won't go overboard,

00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:13.800
I won't break the law.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.600
Don't worry.

00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:26.867
Why would I worry?

00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:34.280
I want to check your injuries.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.879
I'll help you treat them, and then I'll leave.

00:35:36.879 --> 00:35:38.513
I won't linger.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.520
Where's Tian Tian?

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.560
At the neighbor's.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.959
Here, have some ginger tea,
chase off the chill.

00:36:05.959 --> 00:36:07.560
I ran hot water in the tub.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.400
Take a soak.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.679
How far are you going to follow me?

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.800
I want to check your injuries.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.002
It's warm in the bathroom.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.015
You've seen it.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:40.230
You can go out now.

00:37:21.919 --> 00:37:24.102
Why are there so many bruises?

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:27.479
Does it hurt?

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:29.280
It's okay.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.239
It's all my fault.

00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:33.514
I let you get so badly hurt.

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.998
I really am a bastard.

00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:45.280
I caused you all these injuries.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.719
I'm sorry.

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:50.560
If it weren't for me,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.467
you wouldn't be hurt so badly.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.521
I'm sorry.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.531
I'm sorry.

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:13.719
If I leave you,

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:16.430
would you stop getting hurt?

00:38:17.919 --> 00:38:19.997
I should leave.

00:38:21.479 --> 00:38:23.987
I should stay far away from you.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:32.085
I'm sorry.

00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:59.439
Shu Lang.

00:38:59.439 --> 00:39:01.444
I want to stay tonight.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.560
Just once more.

00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:08.537
Is that all right?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.056
I'm sorry.

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:23.019
I'm sorry.

00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:35.080
I should stay far away from you.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.061
I should leave.

00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:00.479
Fine.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.029
Sleep.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.989
I'm leaving.

00:41:02.199 --> 00:41:05.040
I won't show up again.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.467
Take care of yourself and Tian Tian.

00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:29.040
Don't rush to beat up Bai Peng Yu.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.969
If you do, make sure he never gets back up.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.959
I know.

00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:38.079
I won't act rashly.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.431
And...

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.975
Whatever that happened...

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:50.560
It was an accident.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.485
I won't read into it.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.706
You're the gentleness in my eyes.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.524
You are the immortal in my heart.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.541
You are the only reason I love this world.

00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:16.679
You You?

00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.280
Why are you calling so late?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.902
Ms. Shi.

00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:25.159
Didn't you say you'd set me up
with a boyfriend?

00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:26.774
I'd like to meet him.

00:43:26.774 --> 00:43:27.836
Oh?

00:43:27.836 --> 00:43:30.150
Finally willing to let go of the past?

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.504
I'm just afraid I'll turn back
and reread that chapter.
