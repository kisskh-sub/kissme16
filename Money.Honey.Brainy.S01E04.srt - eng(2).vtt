00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.880
What do you mean by this?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.640
This is ruining my image.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.479
Why is the screen black?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.840
Chairman.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.920
Our equipment here...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.640
The surveillance equipment...

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.120
has malfunctioned.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.040
Work on fixing it immediately.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.120
What are you doing?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Sihai will definitely belong to the Young Master in the future.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.920
We must complete the Chairman's task.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.719
But at the same time...

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:20.599
we must not offend the Young Master.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:21.319
Understood?

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.760
Why?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.120
If the Crown Prince takes over...

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.239
and comes after us...

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.799
what do we do?

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.319
You're the well-read one with broad horizons.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.760
A graduate from a Double First-Class university...

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.200
is just different.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.239
Aren't you also from a Double First-Class school?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm a bar dancer.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.200
This...

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.920
counts as punishment for all my rude behavior today.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.159
The punishment I received.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.040
We're even.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.840
Okay?

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.760
Let's call it even for now.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.639
But I really need to restate to you...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639
that from now on, our dates...

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.879
must strictly follow the contract.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.639
I really don't want something like this...

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.719
like this...

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.759
or an incident like this...

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.759
an incident that insults my character, to happen again.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.400
If something like this happens again...

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.479
the contract...

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.960
is void.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.360
Alright?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.800
Remember to pay me.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.159
Two S+++.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.360
Hello?

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.919
Chairman.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.240
They're living together.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.039
The two of them...

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.439
in the middle of the night...

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.280
are cohabiting.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.599
Very good.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.560
You all...

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.520
can wrap up for today.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.479
Chairman.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.080
We have completed the translation work.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.919
Please review it.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.960
I don't want to get married.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.520
That's fine.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.400
Can we have a baby?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.879
No.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.479
Have one with someone else.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.080
If you insist I have one...

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.120
I suggest choosing this exact time today.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.120
Such a precise time?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960
What's the reasoning?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.719
I've launched several packages.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.319
You can...

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.840
Wait.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.400
Packages?

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.120
Chairman.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm quite certain...

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.400
she said "packages."

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.879
Yes.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.319
Chairman.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.719
Give a brief introduction.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.159
The Worry-Free Childbirth Package.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.560
Nine million nine hundred eighty thousand.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.159
You can have four children.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.400
Buy four...

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.280
get one free.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.879
I think this Happy Golden Years Package...

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.680
is also good.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.759
Six million nine hundred eighty thousand.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.520
Three.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.039
So that means...

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.840
the Family Bliss Package...

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.479
offers better value.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.039
Eighteen million eight hundred eighty thousand.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.960
Eight.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.960
Then let's have one.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.159
Nine million nine hundred eighty thousand.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.480
Remember...

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480
when you go back tonight...

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.079
transfer me the money.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.959
Stop, stop, stop!

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:26.560
This kid...

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.920
why didn't he choose...

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
the eighteen million eight hundred eighty thousand one...

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.160
and have eight?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
What an unfilial son.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.639
Are you treating women like sows?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.040
Eight children?

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.720
"What the hell!" is more like it.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.319
What is all this nonsense?

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:39.800
Really.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.399
You...

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.040
You all can go back now.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.839
Yes.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.000
Wait a moment.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.000
Wait a moment.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.360
Twenty-eighth floor.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.879
Thank you.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.639
I heard the new CEO is very handsome.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.920
Really, super, invincibly, explosively handsome.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.720
Just for him...

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.199
I collected ten magazines.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.079
Ten!

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.399
No wonder I couldn't get even one.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.560
So you took them all.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:40.120
Everyone's scrambling for them, okay?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.240
Rico.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.480
You managed to get one too, right?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.120
Tell him to print more quickly.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.920
The village outhouse ran out of paper ages ago.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.079
Hurry, hurry.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.720
Let's go.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.920
Twenty-eighth floor.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.399
Rico.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.160
How is this a

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.079
full French email?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.759
They think too highly of me.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.120
Dear Rico,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.879
Please, before the end of today,

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.199
submit to me the precise schedule

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.759
for all work over the next four quarters.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.839
Good luck.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.040
Galileo

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.319
Darn it!

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.000
Is this Galileo even human?

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.399
Why does it feel like he's targeting you?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.399
Did you

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.639
offend the new CEO?

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:51.959
How could I possibly have the honor of offending him?

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.519
It couldn't be...

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.319
A domineering CEO

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.079
falling for you,

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.560
starting from a

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.199
baseless misunderstanding?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.879
From French emails

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.040
to French cruise ships,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.000
the gears of fate

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.720
are starting to mesh!

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.120
I suggest you

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.800
uninstall those cheesy novels.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.600
The CEO's vindictiveness

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.560
is way too strong.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.800
It was just a joke.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:23.720
I'm merely giving my employee

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.360
a little punishment.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.920
So, the Chairman's concerns

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.600
should be put to rest now?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.399
Need you even ask?

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.600
With my masterful performance,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.399
I can completely pull the wool over their eyes.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.399
Love Surveillance Team,

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.279
are you all in position?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.079
The surveillance operation

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.279
will continue.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.920
My son

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.439
is too good at acting.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.399
Putting on a show is no challenge for him.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:46.720
Unless he can

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.439
maintain a long-term dating facade,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.560
otherwise,

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.040
we absolutely cannot trust him easily.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.639
The timeframe...

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.639
Let's set it at three months first.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.240
Just three months.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.920
The older, the wiser.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.000
This Rico

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.839
has already completed all the work you assigned.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.399
That fast?

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.399
How's the quality?

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.639
Clear data,

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:18.519
sound logic.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.480
Not bad skills.

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.279
She's lucky.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120
Capable people

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.279
can do as they please with me.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.039
Hello?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.960
Xin Tong?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.879
Seven tonight.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.159
Not today.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.559
I'm very tired today.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.120
Double pay.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.200
Send me the time and place.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.120
I'll be right there.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.200
Hello? What's up?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.879
Tonight at seven-thirty,

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:59.200
help me one more time, okay?

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.480
No.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.519
I have a part-time job at seven tonight.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.159
The pay for this one...

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440
double pay, okay?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.279
Last time.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.679
Please, my dear.

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:09.559
Double pay?

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.639
No problem.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.480
Tonight, we continue.

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:15.120
Showtime.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.480
Hello.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:17.639
Hi there.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.240
Sorry I'm late, dear.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.279
My apologies.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.759
You...

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:23.919
what are you doing?

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:25.360
Isn't there a love agent?

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.240
Not here yet.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:28.879
It's fine.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.720
Consider this my gift to you.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.240
Wait a second.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.720
How about the two of us try

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.519
an escape room date today?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.960
What's an

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:37.799
escape room date?

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:44.279
You...

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.879
really won't feel scared?

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.360
I never fear

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.559
things that aren't real.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.240
Excellent.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.039
So, what's next?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.360
You go left,

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.480
I go right.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:11.679
The two of us

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.879
meet at the end.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.320
Do we have to split up?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.559
Of course.

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.200
We each have our own solo tasks.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.799
It'll be fun.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.000
Good luck.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:22.919
You can do it.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:23.960
I'm heading in first.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.000
Table two.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.960
You are...

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.200
Senior?

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.679
Xin Tong?

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.679
Everyone's youth

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.440
is a movie.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:22.840
This...

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.720
is my movie.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.840
Could it be this movie isn't over?

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.200
Years later,

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.279
the male and female leads meet again by chance.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:10.080
Chairman,

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.679
it seems the young lady is secretly

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.919
dating someone behind the Young Master's back.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.600
The Young Master seems to have a rival.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.440
Should we go teach him a lesson?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.080
Don't move.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.919
An outstanding girl

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.679
is bound to have many suitors.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.399
Perfect.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.240
Let's give Wen Pei'an

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.279
a little more

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:24.919
sense of urgency.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.679
So,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.600
this outfit of yours

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.399
is just to sabotage this blind date.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.960
Actually, me being here on this date

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.240
is also my parents' wish.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:57.000
Personally, I don't approve of such arranged marriages.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.120
But I never expected

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.000
that we'd reunite in this way.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:02.759
I didn't expect it either.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.480
It must have been seven or eight years, right?

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:05.159
Eight years.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.840
We

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.519
haven't seen each other for eight years.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
You've become even more beautiful.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.159
Weren't we supposed to be in this together?

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.840
Well, this is about to get interesting.
