00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:10.551
Chase them!

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:10.990
Yes!

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:12.111
Don't let them escape!

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:34.951
Qingru!

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:36.471
Hang on!

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:41.270
Since when did you become so naggy?

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.272
Once you recover,

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.912
kill me or punish me as you wish.

00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:46.990
For now, stay alive.

00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.272
Yuwen Que,

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:50.792
you owe me.

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:52.632
This time,

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:55.391
you'll repay it double.

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:01.111
This time,

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.191
I will protect you completely.

00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:24.431
Eat this.

00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:35.630
Are you really willing

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:37.871
to give me such
a precious Blood Moon Pill?

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:39.752
If you hadn't pushed yourself,

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:42.951
you wouldn't have taken that arrow.

00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:44.831
If I hadn't pushed myself,

00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.792
you would already

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:50.111
be dead right now.

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.711
Why did you save me?

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:54.551
Save you?

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.072
I...

00:02:57.752 --> 00:02:59.390
I just didn't want

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:01.192
you to die so easily.

00:03:02.192 --> 00:03:03.232
Is that so?

00:03:04.992 --> 00:03:06.792
Then why are there tears in your eyes?

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:08.352
You...

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:09.991
Ru.

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:13.151
I know you still care about me.

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.111
Don't flatter yourself.

00:03:16.351 --> 00:03:17.391
What I feel for you

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.671
is nothing but hatred.

00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:22.431
Is that so?

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.512
Then why don't you kill me?

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.192
You think I don't want to?

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:32.352
Then do it.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:34.431
I'm right here.

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:36.592
Do as you please.

00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.472
Don't push your luck.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:39.912

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:42.752
Do you know?

00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:46.312
All these years,
I've been looking for you.

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:50.352
I crossed the misty rains of Jiangnan,

00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:52.951
walked through the snows of Lingbei.

00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:56.711
I went to every place you
said flowers would bloom,

00:03:57.872 --> 00:03:59.871
waited at every ferry crossing,

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.512
yet never found you.

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:06.790
Let go of me!

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.830

The Crown Prince of Mobei
is badly wounded.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.272
He can't have gone far.

00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:03.671
Quick!

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.272
There are so many people outside.

00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:14.870
Go. We'll fight our way out together.

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:15.511
No.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:17.032
You stay.

00:05:17.412 --> 00:05:18.480
What are you planning to do?

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:20.392
I...

00:05:20.472 --> 00:05:22.472
For now, I don't want you dead.

00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:24.191
Even if you die,

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.670
it should be by my hand.

00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:26.430
Qingru.

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:27.392
What you owe me,

00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.511
remember to repay

00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:29.511
with your life.

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:30.832
No!

00:05:31.392 --> 00:05:33.745
This time,
I won't let you face it alone.

00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:35.272
If you dare go out,

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.592
I'll kill myself on the spot,

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.991
so you won't be torn between us.

00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:43.912
Don't worry.

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:46.111
They won't dare touch me.

00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:57.991
Stop searching.

00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.272
I'm here.

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:03.152
I'll go with you.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:04.431
Your Ladyship, this way.

00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:14.557
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:33.912
Qingru.

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:36.270
I cherished you like a pearl in my palm.

00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:38.271
Why do you repeatedly

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:40.507
help the prince of an enemy state?

00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:42.392
A pearl in your palm?

00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:45.551
How ironic.

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.191
When my mother died,

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.392
where were you, Father?

00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:53.631
Why are you so determined

00:06:53.952 --> 00:06:56.271
to side with your mother's killer?

00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:57.751
My mother's killer?

00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:58.751
And what about you?

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:01.352
You watched my mother die

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.912
and did nothing.

00:07:04.472 --> 00:07:05.671
An accomplice?

00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:07.032
Do you think

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.551
I didn't want to save her back then?

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.352
So you still hate me.

00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:15.952
I failed you as your father.

00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:18.392
But I too

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.152
had no choice.

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:23.991
What a fine excuse.

00:07:26.472 --> 00:07:28.232
The ruler of a nation,

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:31.392
yet unable to save the woman he loved.

00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:33.991
Your "no choice"

00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:36.712
became my mother's death sentence.

00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:38.271
Qingru.

00:07:38.272 --> 00:07:39.350
Do you know?

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.870
When my mother died,

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.472
she was still defending you,

00:07:43.072 --> 00:07:44.952
saying she wasn't worthy of you.

00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:50.431
Don't touch me.

00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:52.472
Your hands

00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.352
are still stained
with my mother's blood.

00:08:03.592 --> 00:08:05.071
Leave us.

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:08.952
Qingru.

00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:12.311
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:15.352
Drink the medicine first.

00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:17.995
What?

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:21.472
Now you remember
how to be a loving father?

00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:23.712
It's too late.

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:32.751
Do you know why I saved Yuwen Que?

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:34.392
Even though he's my enemy,

00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:36.551
at least he dared
to take responsibility.

00:08:37.472 --> 00:08:38.631
Unlike someone else,

00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:42.072
who only pretends on his dragon throne.

00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:43.472
Qingru,

00:08:43.632 --> 00:08:46.072
are you breaking ties with me?

00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:47.751
When we

00:08:48.512 --> 00:08:49.952
ever close?

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.432
On that wretched dragon robe of yours,

00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:58.472
there's no place even
for a strand of my mother's hair.

00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:04.192
This was left by your mother.

00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.712
I'd rather

00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:18.552
have been born to an ordinary family.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.620
At least then,

00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:23.472
I wouldn't have to endure
such hypocritical love.

00:09:23.992 --> 00:09:25.151
Qingru,

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:27.312
I know I'm wrong.

00:09:30.272 --> 00:09:31.312
It's too late.

00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:56.111
Your Majesty, bad news!

00:09:57.872 --> 00:09:59.271
Your Majesty, bad news!

00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:03.190
What happened?

00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:04.751
The Crown Prince of Mobei is dead.

00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:07.871
Are you certain?

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:10.111
Absolutely.
The shadow guards saw it themselves.

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:11.832
He was struck by three arrows,

00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:14.031
fell off a cliff,
and was swept away by the river.

00:10:15.912 --> 00:10:17.151
Where is the body?

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:19.070
The current was too strong.
It was carried away.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:19.845
Search!

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.911
Send men to search along the river.

00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:24.952
You must find the body.

00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:28.231
Alive or dead, I want proof.

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.031
Yes.

00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:45.430
Reporting to Your Ladyship.
Military news from Mobei.

00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:48.871
Yuwen Que was killed in battle
during a clash with the border troops.

00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:56.592
Killed in battle?

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:05.751
He didn't deserve such an easy death.

00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:08.832
Young lady, it's me.
