00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.590
Tianye!

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.660
Tianye.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.690
Tianye.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.710
Why did you drink so much?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.600
Tianye.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.200
Are you okay?

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:07.210
Tianye.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.550
Where are you going?

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.150
What are you looking for?

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.190
Are you out of your mind?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.340
How can you take medicine
right after drinking?

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.510
It hurts.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.030
Tianye,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.900
eat something first.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.060
Then you can take your medicine, okay?

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.440
Stop drinking!

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.750
Leave me alone!

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.750
Just ignore me, okay?

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.570
Your brother died because of me!

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.270
Do you understand?

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.350
It was all my fault!

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.370
Why do you even care about me?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.510
I see you as a brother too!

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.790
Just leave me alone, all of you!

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.890
Let me drink myself to death, okay?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.040
What's the use in doing this?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.270
What's wrong?

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.420
He's trying to take medicine
after drinking.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.760
Keep an eye on him!

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.110
Tianye.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.380
Don't do this.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.550
Feng.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.230
I got Jiangyong killed.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.830
Jiangyong died because of me...

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.370
Tianye.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.480
It wasn't your fault.
Don't blame yourself.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.280
It wasn't you.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.980
You didn't do it, Tianye.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.650
Don't blame yourself, okay?

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.960
You didn't do it.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.570
I did...

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.880
I...

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.540
I'm a sinner!

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.310
You didn't do it, Tianye.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.640
It was Luo Bo and the others
who got him killed. It's not your fault.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.640
Why didn't you arrest Luo Bo?

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.200
Arrest him!

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.240
I...

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.900
I had to save you first.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.090
What about Jiangyong?

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.070
I had no choice.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.790
There was nothing I could do.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.880
Stop thinking about it.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.940
Jiangyong is gone,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.950
but we have to live our lives.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.450
We can't go on like this.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.420
What was his last word?

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.490
He said...

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.440
He hoped all of you could be well,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.770
no more fighting.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.350
What else?

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.990
He said...

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.920
He wanted to go home.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.480
Go home.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.310
Go home...

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.460
Tianye.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.160
Why didn't you take him home?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.920
Tianye.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.300
Don't be like this.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.800
Calm down.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.390
Don't cry.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.730
Why do I have to carry stones?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.340
They represent your mistakes, Tianye.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.310
One must learn from childhood

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.110
that mistakes come with a price.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.830
Carry the stones up the mountain
and throw them away,

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.030
and then you can correct your mistakes.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.670
You must not only carry them on your back

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.670
but also keep them in your heart.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.300
You must carry extremely heavy stones,

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.960
perhaps for the rest of your life,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.360
and it still won't be enough
for atonement.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.070
Admit your mistakes

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.350
and accept your punishment.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.030
Only when you really
realize your mistakes and correct them

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.300
can you put down the stones you carry.

Crazy.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.950
Why are you back at work already?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.720
How's everything going
with your family situation?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.520
It's fine now.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.680
Really?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.160
You told me at the hospital

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.280
that you wanted to floor it.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.520
I'm a bit worried.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.010
What's your plan exactly?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.740
Just take them down.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.940
I asked Mai to find them.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.050
Neither Song Hao

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.990
nor Luo Bo

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.370
can get away.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.390
As long as we don't break the rules,
it's your call.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.000
Stop digging in my pockets.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.720
Let's eat.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.000
It's already become a habit.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.340
Your investigation is finally over.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.930
Any news?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.310
Mr. Ma.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.180
I've been stuck at home every day.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.510
How could I get any news?

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.590
It seems that my uncle

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.240
is still investigating it.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.640
Your uncle can't help you.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.790
What should you do?

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.880
That's right.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.790
Mr. Ma,

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.200
what should I do?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.850
Don't be afraid.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160
If your uncle doesn't want to help you,
I will.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.360
If you need anything,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.400
just tell me.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.750
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.120
But...

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.050
I also need your help.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.120
Mr. Ma,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.850
what can I do for you?

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.510
Just tell me.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.750
I want you to visit Mr. Wang.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.790
Talk to

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.110
his daughter

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.240
and see if she has
any news about Song Hao.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.000
Mr. Ma,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.110
you know,

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.510
given the relationship
between my uncle and Mr. Wang,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.130
I don't think he wants to see me.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.790
You're smart.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.390
You'll find a way, won't you?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.070
Mr. Ma!

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.790
Okay.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.250
I'll figure something out.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.820
Leave it to me.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.750
Okay.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:28.790
[Public Security]

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:29.640
Did you bring all the documents?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.110
Yes.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.680
Okay.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.890
D-Director Ye.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.650
Director Ye.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.910
Why is he back already?

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.170
Director Ye.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.470
-Come in.
-Director Ye.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.240
Have a seat, Qin Feng.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.720
Okay.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.900
I've been away for a while,

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.600
and my orchids are wilting.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.940
It seems

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.030
you got back to work today

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.630
because you knew I'd return.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.170
I do have to come back

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.330
and report to you about my recent work.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.190
Go ahead.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.270
We discovered

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.610
that Ye Siyuan

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.070
has contacted Wang Yiyi, Song Hao's wife,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.410
very frequently.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.410
He must be trying to get some money

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.030
while Song Hao is in trouble.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.750
Just investigate as we normally would.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.390
Don't worry about my nephew.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.930
Got it.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.960
Actually, Wang Yiyi

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.640
doesn't have any direct connection

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.240
with Jinding Group.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.110
Song Hao was in charge of

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.810
financial operations

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960
within the group.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.400
If we

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.850
investigate their money directly

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.790
and freeze the funds for investigation,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.400
we'll be able to find out

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.830
who owns the money.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.640
Okay.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.550
Loser from Longwan, what are you doing?

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.200
Stop!

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.640
Boss, they broke in!

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.370
What do you think you're doing?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.240
Mr. Liu,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160
what a rare guest.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.070
What brings you guys here?

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.560
Take me to see your brother.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.340
Earlier,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.140
I heard that someone smashed your head,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.920
and I didn't believe it.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.170
Turns out it's true!

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.400
What are you saying?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.160
Watch your language!

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.020
Don't touch me!

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.060
Go away!

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.130
Don't touch me!

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.880
Tianfei.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.480
Look at the state you're in.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.340
Why are you still acting so tough?

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.720
You people from Longwan

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.830
are all seriously injured yet so stubborn.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.030
How dare you come here

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.960
and try to ask my brother for money?

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:58.750
Fine.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.220
You want money, right?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.030
Okay.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.310
Take it!

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.000
-Is it enough?
-Go away!

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.550
Is it enough?

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.590
Tianye!

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.880
Take me to your brother.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.100
Liu Tianye,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.940
you have nothing now.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.680
You have to beg me.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:27.600
Understand?

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.110
You have no money,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.050
and you'll lose your land soon.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.330
Jiangyong is also dead.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.490
If you'd just focused on

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.240
selling chickens
instead of dreaming of fortunes,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.230
none of this would've happened.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.860
How dare you ask me for money?

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.030
Come on!

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.640
Step back!

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.550
Kill me!

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.070
Do you know whose turf this is?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.200
I don't care!

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.310
Tell your brother to come out!

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.270
Step back!

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.530
Come on!

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.000
Calm down.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.480
Tell him to come.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.070
Tianye.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.730
I just finished a piece of calligraphy.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.040
Come and take a look.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.750
Hurry!

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.160
Calm down.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.920
Tianye.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.160
Mind creates reality.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.740
How do you feel about

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.370
these words?

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.970
I'm here to discuss something important.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.360
It seems my calligraphy

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.270
is not profound enough.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.720
What do you want

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.960
to discuss?

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.880
Didn't you ask me

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.330
if we could make a deal?

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.110
Yes,

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.200
we can.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.720
I'll give you what you want.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.620
I don't even know what I want.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.270
Ma Jin.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.730
You know, all these years,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.720
I've devoted myself to calligraphy

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.180
just because I don't want
to get involved...

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.730
I don't want to get involved
in these worldly affairs,

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.310
let alone all the fighting and killing.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.680
I know you've always wanted
to replace Ma Jin,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.640
and you also want the casino business.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.350
You dare not touch him

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.610
because you know someone is backing him.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.680
But I dare.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.210
Longwan has nothing left now.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.480
I want him to give back

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.000
everything he took from us.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.160
I can also expose

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.740
the person behind him.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.630
Easier said than done.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.440
I know

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.920
you are a person of loyalty and principle.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.200
But besides that,

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.100
what else do you have?

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:10.830
My life.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.270
I've been gambling with my life
from the beginning.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.680
Now that I'm still alive,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.250
it means I'm still qualified for the game.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.960
It's not a bad deal for you, right?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.530
In this world,

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.350
some people want profit,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.570
some want victory.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.500
But I, He Muzhi,

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.560
only care if one can be loyal

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.570
and keep their promise.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.310
You're standing before me alive.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.240
Well done.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.850
Then I'll

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.280
place the bet

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.680
with you.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.660
H-How can we move this?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.120
A noble person loves wealth
but acquires it through righteous means.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.050
I didn't take a penny of your money.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.989
It's all here.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.150
Okay.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.130
Then we'll use the money

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.800
to make a deal

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.000
with you.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.940
Go ahead.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.400
We want to buy

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.530
shares of your company.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.760
What do you think?

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.730
Deal.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320
My money is in your husband's hands.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.630
Ye Siyuan is a liar.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.140
He can't help Song Hao.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.590
Also,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.360
you've caught the attention
of the police as well.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.280
Now,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.540
only I can help you.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.040
Can you save him?

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.160
Tell Song Hao to contact me.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.840
Everyone is looking for him.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.100
Why should I trust you?

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.270
You have no choice.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.360
Song Hao.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.960
You're finally willing
to talk with your old friend.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.360
Sir,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.110
how do you plan to help me?

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.790
You're standing
in the eye of the storm.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.670
Ma Jin is looking for you everywhere,

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.930
and Luo Bo has escaped.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.650
Now,

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.560
anyone close to you
will be struck by thunder.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.950
There's no way you can come back.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.440
Sir,

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.770
what's that supposed to mean?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.320
I don't understand.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.240
If Ma Jin doesn't back down,

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760
this ship

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.420
will sink sooner or later.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.110
And when that happens,

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.850
everyone will be on their own.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.110
I won't help Ma Jin,

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.360
and I don't care where you are.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.990
Right now,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.130
I just want my money.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.880
Okay.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.690
I can keep quiet.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.150
But you need to get three passports

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.170
for my family

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.820
and send us abroad.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.000
Otherwise, you'll never see that money.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.660
No problem.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.510
Money

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.700
for passports.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.590
Okay.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.030
I'll decide on

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.510
the time and place.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.000
Okay.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.380
Zhong.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.510
Ji.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.370
Can you attend the legal studies seminar

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.000
this weekend?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.670
I can't.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.230
I'll be working overtime.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.480
I have a pile of cases to solve.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.650
I was hoping you could brief me on it.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.230
Captain Ji.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.570
Director Peng.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.190
Why haven't I seen

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.590
ECID's analysis report?

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.510
I almost forgot.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.880
I'll have someone prepare it right away.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.190
It won't hold things up.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.800
By the way,

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.600
about the model unit selection,

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.400
you need to keep working on it.

Yes, Director Yan.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.920
No problem.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.840
We're working on it.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.640
Working on it.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.530
Don't worry.

the East Passenger Transport Center.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.890
I'll stall for time.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.180
Director Ye.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.320
Let's

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.330

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:23.860

Okay.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.990
Keep digging.

there's something I need to report to you.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.370
and they're making plans.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.240
I think they're targeting you.
