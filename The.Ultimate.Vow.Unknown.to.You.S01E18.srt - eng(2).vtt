00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:12.546
Young lady, it's me.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:15.707
Why you are here?

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:17.026
I came to get you out.

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:19.466
I'll go distract the guards first.

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:26.267
Yuwen Que.

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:31.147
I will take your life with my own hands.

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.306
With your blood,

00:01:34.307 --> 00:01:36.067
I will offer it to my mother.

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.227
I won't let anyone else do it.

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:47.386
(If you really dare to die,)

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.267
(I'll make sure you find
no peace even in the afterlife.)

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:56.067
Who's there?

00:01:57.747 --> 00:01:59.106
Your Ladyship, where are you going?

00:01:59.107 --> 00:01:59.906
Kill me if you want.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:00.907
Do as you please.

00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:03.586
But if you want to catch me,
first see if your lives allow it.

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.347
Then don't blame me for being rude.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:11.625
You...

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:14.147
What? Do you think my death
isn't real enough?

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:28.266
Such a vicious heart.

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:30.440
You even spread the news
that you had died in battle.

00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:33.507
I'm here, aren't I?

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.787
I knew you would worry about me.

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:37.266
Who's worried about you?

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:38.307
I just...

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.146
I'm afraid you'd die too easily.

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:41.587
Don't make me worry again.

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:42.507
I'll take you away.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:44.065
They're over here.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:44.666
Quick.

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.587
Remember the sword technique
I taught you?

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.266
I remember.

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:52.027
- Let's fight our way out together.
- Alright.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.266
You brought me here.

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:17.067
Do you remember this place?

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:31.507
Always doing such tacky things.

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.067
And yet you're smiling so happily.

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:34.266
Am I?

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:44.146
Why

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:46.507
are you so close to me?

00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:47.826
Naturally,

00:03:49.307 --> 00:03:50.627
I have improper thoughts.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.587
Since the moment I met you,

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:58.266
you've belonged to me.

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:00.546
Where else are you going?

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:02.866
Sweet talk.

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:10.706
♪Patina slowly spreads over me♪

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:12.787
I wish it could always be like this.

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:14.187
It will.

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:15.946
I promise you.

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:18.666
I will protect you in this life.

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:22.311
And in the next, I'll marry you again.

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:29.520
♪Slowly I get used to it,
letting you tread on my scars♪

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.420

♪Moss spreading inch by inch♪

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.387
I never thought the Mobei Crown Prince

00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:48.506
would remember
such trivial romantic things.

00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:50.106
I remember everything about you.

00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:51.426
But unfortunately,

00:04:51.947 --> 00:04:53.506
it's all fake.

00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:54.827
Is it?

00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:56.866
Then why did you save me?

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:57.706
Let go.

00:04:57.707 --> 00:05:00.586
You knew there was an ambush.
Why did you rush out to warn me anyway?

00:05:00.587 --> 00:05:01.587
I told you,

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.746
I will kill you with my own hands.

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:06.907
My Ru

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:08.745
still so stubborn.

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:10.027
Don't call me that.

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:12.266
Ru who foolishly trusted you

00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:13.467
is already dead.

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.506
But my Ru is still alive,

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.106
right here.

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:20.947
You liar.

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:22.746
Give me a chance.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.227
Let me explain everything.

00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:27.827
Just like that time by the river,

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.106
we spoke about everything.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:31.707
It's too late.

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.426
As long as you still care about me,
it's not too late.

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:02.225
Chase!

00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:03.986
They're here, hurry!

00:06:07.546 --> 00:06:08.746
There's a boat over there.

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:18.227
They're trying to escape!

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:19.186
Chase!

00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:27.707
How could

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.665
my daughter escape right
under your eyes?

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:32.787
Your Majesty,

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:34.946
she was kidnapped by Yuwen Que's men.

00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:36.347
Yuwen Que?

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:41.666
So it's Yuwen Que.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.426
Send orders to the shadow guards.

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:46.506
Yes.

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:48.466
Eliminate Yuwen Que

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.105
at all costs.

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:51.186
Yes.

00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:52.827
Then...

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.426
What about the princess?

00:06:54.546 --> 00:06:56.267
Better to capture her alive.

00:06:56.986 --> 00:06:58.720
If that's impossible,

00:06:58.746 --> 00:06:59.666
kill her.

00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:01.266
No mercy.

00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:02.466
Your Majesty, Madam back then...

00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:03.267
Silence!

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:07.757
I will never let Mobei
use this against us.

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:09.906
If it comes to that,

00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:12.845
I must personally eliminate
this weakness.

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:30.545
We're temporarily safe.

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:31.436
I don't think so.

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.132
Wait.

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:35.227
Hold on.

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:36.865
I am the Princess of Cangzhou.

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:37.666
Princess?

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:39.626
Then you should die even more.

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:40.866
If you want to touch her,

00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:42.225
you must get past me first.

00:07:42.226 --> 00:07:43.666
They're not from Cangzhou.

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:50.066
He's using his left hand
to wield the sword.

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:53.146
Young lady, this token is exclusive
to the Mobei royal family.

00:07:53.147 --> 00:07:56.545
I just checked. The madam and the young master
were injured by the soft sword.

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:58.557
The assassin used right-hand
sword techniques.

00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:03.666
The Crown Prince's soft sword skill

00:08:03.707 --> 00:08:05.866
seems different from the rumors.

00:08:05.947 --> 00:08:07.587
That's because your experience
is limited.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:14.746
No.

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:16.467
Completely wrong.

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:18.626
But back then the sword technique

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:20.866
was clearly right-handed.

00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:22.426
Could it be

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.626
Yuwen Que?

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.827
You fool.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.587
If you had really killed back then,

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:31.787
why did you shield me
from the sword again and again?

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:33.347
All these years,

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:35.147
have I misjudged you?

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:36.546
Does it matter?

00:08:37.387 --> 00:08:38.425
As long as you're fine.

00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:39.506
Why?

00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:41.467
Why did you bear all this?

00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:43.120
I want you to survive.

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:44.705
Today,

00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:46.146
you won't escape even with wings.

00:08:46.147 --> 00:08:47.227
Attack!

00:08:52.227 --> 00:08:53.347
Take Young Lady Shen away.

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:55.106
Go!

00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:06.347
Are you alright?

00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:07.347
Chase!

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:08.665
They must be not far ahead.

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:09.585
You go first.

00:09:09.586 --> 00:09:10.465
Don't worry about me.

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.427
Don't be reckless.

00:09:11.507 --> 00:09:12.857
If I die, we die together.

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:27.947
You knew all along, didn't you?

00:09:29.826 --> 00:09:30.947
I only know

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:34.067
if you had wanted to harm us back then,

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.220
you wouldn't have let me live until now.

00:09:40.627 --> 00:09:42.746
Yet I still couldn't save your mother.

00:09:44.987 --> 00:09:46.467
I'm sorry, Ru.

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:55.106
Ru, are you alright?

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:02.427
This time,

00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:05.427
I will protect you completely.

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:06.870
Yuwen Que.

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:09.386
Do you know?

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:12.427
I have countless times

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.746
wanted to kill you with my own hands.

00:10:16.347 --> 00:10:17.295
I know.

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:20.626
But I could never bring myself
to be cruel.

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.746
This is probably

00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.026
my greatest weakness.

00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.587
This is our shared stubbornness.

00:10:42.946 --> 00:10:43.906
Inside.

00:10:51.925 --> 00:10:52.900
Wait.

00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:55.746
With this jade in hand,

00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:56.945
do you remember

00:10:56.946 --> 00:10:58.067
whose token this is?

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:00.307
Tonight, we'll clean

00:11:00.387 --> 00:11:02.427
Cangzhou's blood all in one go.

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:03.707
If you want to touch her,

00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:05.906
first ask if my sword agrees.
