=Season 1=

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 22=

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.000
You're here again.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.159
Beautiful flowers.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:50.031
Zhao.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.220
You're closing your stall, huh?

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:52.822
Yes.

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.630
Let's drink today
while our liquor remains.

00:01:58.272 --> 00:01:59.272
Oh, my dear.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:00.471
Scholar Zhao.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.231
Why is it you two again?

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:05.471
Such bad luck.

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:07.391
What do you want?

00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:08.591
Zhao Wanli,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.471
they helped you pay off
your old liquor debt.

00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:11.832
Shouldn't you thank them?

00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.832
No need to be polite.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.311
Who asked them to pay?

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.552
Serve the liquor.

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:20.152
There's no liquor for you today,
Scholar Zhao.

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:20.751
That's right.

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.191
They've bought all of it.

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.191
Then you chat.

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.232
I'll be off.

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:24.872
Thank you.

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.311
All sold out?

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.552
What exactly

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.071
do you want?

00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.152
We just want...

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:37.751
All the liquor in this shop,

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.672
you can drink as much as you like.

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:44.311
But you must
answer a few questions first.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.380
You want to ask about
the Autumn Twilight Painting, right?

00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:49.872
Exactly.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:51.952
I'd rather die than fall for your trick.

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:53.712
Worst case, I won't drink today.

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:55.392
Tomorrow, it'll be gone anyway.

00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:00.232
Tonight,
we'll move all this liquor away.

00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:02.791
You'll never drink this kind again.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:04.712
Right, Madam Ran?

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:05.791
It's a family recipe.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:06.952
This is all that's left.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.432
You bought all of it.

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:14.751
3,000 Drunken Tavern
really has good liquor.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.631
Fine.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.622
So that's how you want to play it?

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:24.392
Alright then.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.888
You want to ask about
the Autumn Twilight Painting?

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:28.272
I have a condition, too.

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:30.591
One question per pot of liquor.

00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:33.152
However much I drink,
you drink the same.

00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:34.392
If one gets drunk, we all do.

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.791
Don't think about

00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.511
pulling sneaky tricks once I'm drunk.

00:03:37.712 --> 00:03:39.191
Good liquor should be shared.

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:40.031
No problem.

00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:40.631
Alright.

00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:42.432
Wait.

00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:43.952
How many pots can we even drink?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.791
Each question counts.

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:47.152
Please.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:48.751
Cheers!

00:03:55.232 --> 00:03:55.989
First question.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.444
Why did you copy so many
Autumn Twilight Painting paintings?

00:03:58.533 --> 00:03:59.733
What do you mean by "copy"?

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:02.031
I painted
the Autumn Twilight Painting myself.

00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:04.552
I can paint as many as I want.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.471
You're lying.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.022
The Autumn Twilight Painting
was painted by Gu Zhiqian.

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:10.432
Speaking of Gu,

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:13.872
he was my greatest confidant in life.

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:15.031
Confidant?

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.071
You lived a hundred years apart.

00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:19.191
When he passed away,
you weren't even born.

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:20.711
How could you be confidants?

00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.631
That's because...

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.071
That's another question.

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:27.992
Another pot.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.111
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:35.631
Go on.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.266
How did you become confidants?

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.872
Gu and I

00:04:38.872 --> 00:04:41.592
shared the same fate.

00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:43.711
How many truly make the honor roll

00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:46.151
in the imperial examination path?

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.631
So many scholars

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.792
waste away their years.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.710
In the blink of an eye,
a lifetime is gone.

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.469
You're dodging the question.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.244
That's basically saying nothing.

00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.391
How could you understand my bond
with Gu?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.022
True kindred spirits are hard to find.

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:12.071
To have one confidant in life is enough.

00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:17.592
Come.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:18.792
To our confidant,

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.271
let's have another pot.

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:21.191
Alright.

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:21.992
Pour the liquor.

00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.311
Scholar Zhao.

00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:38.711
You

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:40.071
just tell us.

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:42.912
Where exactly did you hide

00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:47.071
the Autumn Twilight Painting?

00:05:49.777 --> 00:05:51.070
The Autumn Twilight Painting...

00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:53.032
I'll tell you.

00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.432
I'll tell you where it is.

00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:00.071
It's in my heart.

00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:04.191
You...

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:07.151
will never find
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.792
Gu.

00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:16.071
You are

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.472
my whole life's

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.831
best confidant.

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:34.311
That's all?

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.992
Why did you stop halfway?

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:37.951
Get him up.

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.631
Keep drinking.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:40.792
Get up.

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:42.992
Up!

00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.151
Take him back.

00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:46.872
Get up!

00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:47.792
I haven't...

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:49.912
I haven't drunk.

00:06:51.391 --> 00:06:53.032
I haven't had enough.

00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.992
Gu...

00:07:00.432 --> 00:07:03.672
- Liangzhu Silk.
- Liangzhu Silk.

00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:13.232
Is my taste really that bad?

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.672
Why do I

00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:17.472
not see what's so good
about this painting?

00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:21.232
Where's Autumn?

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.151
Give it to me!

00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:24.511
Give it to me!

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:25.592
No.

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:27.951
Alright.

00:07:27.992 --> 00:07:28.831
Name your price.

00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:30.432
No matter how much, we'll buy it.

00:07:30.592 --> 00:07:32.232
All this liquor is yours.

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:33.112
Enough nonsense.

00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:35.631
The Autumn Twilight Painting is my life.

00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:36.751
I'd die before selling it.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.391
Yes.

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:38.032
Give it back!

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:39.511
Return it!

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:41.912
Or I'll smash this place up.

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:44.592
Return it!

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.112
Alright.

00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:46.829
Get lost!

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.800
It's a misunderstanding!

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:48.555
A misunderstanding!

00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:49.000
Get lost!

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:50.432
We'll leave.

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:52.472
Don't be impulsive!

00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:53.831
A misunderstanding.

00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:55.552
Out!

00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.992
Scoundrels.

00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:08.711
Gu.

00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:11.592
Your painting wasn't lost.

00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.432
It's still here.

00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.352
I really didn't expect him
to be so stubborn.

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:25.511
This time, we found
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:28.511
He must've memorized our faces.

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:30.672
So next time,

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:32.511
how are we supposed to take it?

00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:35.712
Let's go back to Yashe first.

00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:39.072
Why?

00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:40.031
I'm going to sleep.

00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:41.952
You're not taking the painting?

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.044
There must be something strange
about this.

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:46.155
After we wake up,
we'll go find Gu Zhiqian.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.440
(One Hundred Years Ago)
The Gu family was renowned in Gusu City,

00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:53.288
rich beyond measure.

00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:54.431
Gu Zhiqian

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:55.422
is young and carefree,

00:08:55.422 --> 00:08:56.444
handsome and debonair,

00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:57.992
a classic spoiled noble.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.422
A frequent visitor to brothels
and pleasure houses.

00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:02.551
We're here.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.488
(Gu Residence)
So this is the Gu Residence?

00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:09.352
You really can't tell

00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:10.791
that it was once so famous,

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:12.271
and immensely wealthy.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.352
Let's go in first.

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.232
It's actually quite large inside.

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:29.671
A rich household, after all.

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:56.271
This is

00:09:57.232 --> 00:09:58.352
Gu Zhiqian?

00:09:58.592 --> 00:09:59.592
Seems like it.

00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:02.112
Something wrong?

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:05.271
He looks too destitute.

00:10:06.112 --> 00:10:06.631
Then,

00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.511
did we come to the wrong era?

00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:11.992
Shouldn't be wrong.

00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:16.192
You know,

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:17.791
artists are always a bit unkempt.

00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:29.230
Fantastic peaks and graceful trees,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.155
sparse forests and distant islets,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.151
autumn colors dye the layered woods.

00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:34.992
The mood is vast, serene, and clear.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:39.072
This is the true
Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:10:40.631 --> 00:10:41.551
Since we've found it,

00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.631
we'll take it with us.

00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:44.952
Isn't this still stealing?

00:10:47.592 --> 00:10:48.431
However,

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:50.431
his Autumn Twilight Painting

00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:53.551
seems basically finished.

00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:56.511
But why did Zhao Wanli's
only get half-painted?

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:00.271
Right.

00:11:01.192 --> 00:11:02.751
Everything should

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:05.031
have a cause before the effect.

00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:07.712
You can't have the effect
before the cause.

00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:16.212
(Twelve Years Ago)

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:19.832
Alas.

00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:21.192
Alas.

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.511
Where does sorrow come from?

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:25.312
This dancer

00:11:25.377 --> 00:11:27.510
is the top courtesan
of the entertainment district.

00:11:27.911 --> 00:11:30.031
And now she dances here
with all her might.

00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:32.352
Gu doesn't paint beauties,

00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:33.872
but landscapes instead.

00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:36.431
I mourn for the beauty.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.050
(Gu Zhiqian)
Dancing beneath the willows

00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:43.559
with the moon above,

00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:46.232
singing beneath the
peach blossom fan wind.

00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:49.472
This beauty

00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:50.950
dances with the wind and moon.

00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:52.712
And this wind and moon

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:53.992
belong to nature.

00:11:55.072 --> 00:11:56.312
Within this nature,

00:11:56.791 --> 00:11:58.312
she blends with the landscape.

00:11:58.488 --> 00:12:01.270
Much better than being stuck at home
studying the Confucian classics,

00:12:01.352 --> 00:12:02.592
or chasing arranged marriages.

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:05.511
The landscapes I paint

00:12:06.072 --> 00:12:08.271
are beyond your understanding.

00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:10.151
Indeed.

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:11.671
Our Young Master Gu

00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:12.872
is the most refined.

00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:14.511
We, a bunch of coarse men,

00:12:14.511 --> 00:12:17.992
are only concerned about how slender
the beauty's waist is,

00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:20.271
and how red her lips are.

00:12:20.992 --> 00:12:21.352
Come on.

00:12:21.472 --> 00:12:22.192
Come on.

00:12:22.712 --> 00:12:23.151
Fine.

00:12:23.472 --> 00:12:24.712
Today is my birthday.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:25.431
Speak.

00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:26.888
What do you want to play?

00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:27.630
Don't.

00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:30.232
Precisely because today
is your birthday,

00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:32.192
we should also be refined.

00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:33.112
Gu,

00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:34.431
in this moment,

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.511
why not compose a poem

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.791
to praise the beauty?

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:39.832
Good.

00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:41.712
Bring the paper.

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:02.352
Done.

00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:03.592
See how it is.

00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:11.551
Dawn is hazy,

00:13:12.031 --> 00:13:14.232
and the beauty just puts on a silk robe.

00:13:14.631 --> 00:13:16.112
Her eyes slightly intoxicated,

00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:18.592
her brows half-wet like green hills.

00:13:18.872 --> 00:13:21.952
Her tiny waist resembles
a heart wounded by spring.

00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:24.751
The heavy doors close,
delicate hands fatigued,

00:13:24.755 --> 00:13:26.790
fearing the oriole's song
might shatter the moment.

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:29.472
Poor little young lady.

00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:30.911
Beautiful lines.

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:32.312
- Beautiful lines.
- Great!

00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:34.872
- Good.
- Good!

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.312
Hurry up.

00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:40.511
Madam will arrive soon.

00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:41.551
Sneaking a taste again?

00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:44.509
Since it's Young Master's birthday,

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.080
aren't these supposed to be his friends?

00:13:46.088 --> 00:13:47.000
But it's actually them.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.990
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.444
That is the Second Young Lady
of the Lin family of Gusu City.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:52.671
Next to her is

00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:54.872
the eldest unmarried niece
of the Wang family.

00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:56.631
And the one at the back is

00:13:56.631 --> 00:13:59.312
the eldest daughter of the newly moved
Shen family from Jinling.

00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:01.112
In my opinion,

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:03.352
all the young ladies
from Gusu City prominent families

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:04.592
have been invited.

00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:06.592
No wonder.

00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:07.952
They said it's a birthday banquet,

00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:08.829
but actually,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.790
it's to select a young mistress
for Young Master.

00:14:10.992 --> 00:14:11.952
Exactly.

00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:14.511
If Young Master doesn't find
a young mistress soon,

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:17.631
he might end up being
devoured alive by you.

00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:18.631
Yanwu!

00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:19.712
Exactly.

00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:21.072
Am I wrong?

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:24.751
Just wait.

00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:28.030
Stop making a fuss.

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:28.631
Madam is here.

00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:29.911
Why hasn't Young Master arrived?

00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:31.791
Could he be oversleeping again?

00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:33.352
Xingyu,

00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:34.751
(Madam Gu)
quickly go fetch Young Master.

00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:35.911
Please come in, everyone.

00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:37.271
Why is it me again?

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:37.911
Stop dawdling.

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:38.750
Go quickly.

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.031
Got it.

00:14:49.592 --> 00:14:50.431
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:55.391
Please all be seated.

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:00.391
So sumptuous.

00:15:00.592 --> 00:15:02.112
Madam, you've worked hard.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.431
- Indeed.
- Yes.

00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:05.712
Where is Young Master?

00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:07.631
Wasn't he supposed to arrive early?

00:15:07.832 --> 00:15:08.872
Madam.

00:15:08.872 --> 00:15:11.232
Young Master studied
until the middle of the night.

00:15:11.352 --> 00:15:13.151
He's a bit tired today.

00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:15.511
I asked Xingyu to fetch him.

00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:16.832
Studied until midnight?

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.551
Is he all right?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.800
(Master Gu)
Could he have caught a cold?

00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:24.352
This child doesn't know how
to take care of himself.

00:15:24.352 --> 00:15:25.472
Where's that rascal?

00:15:27.712 --> 00:15:28.712
Master,

00:15:30.271 --> 00:15:32.192
Zhiqian stayed up late studying.

00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:33.192
He'll be here soon.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.031
Studying?

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:35.872
Don't mention studying.

00:15:35.872 --> 00:15:37.151
If you do, I'll be furious.

00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:38.749
The tutor I hired for him

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.666
taught for over half a month
before realizing

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:41.844
that the student

00:15:41.888 --> 00:15:43.488
was that rascal's servant.

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.472
Impossible.

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:46.592
Useless thing,

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:47.751
idling away every day.

00:15:47.872 --> 00:15:49.511
He had his servant attend class for him.

00:15:49.631 --> 00:15:50.791
His essays make no sense.

00:15:51.072 --> 00:15:53.551
He even learns the gossip
of the entertainment district.

00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.069
Truly lazy and stupid.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.377
A rotten tree can't be carved.

00:15:58.352 --> 00:15:58.872
Come.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.911
Master, please calm down.

00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:04.151
Even if Zhiqian has made
a grave mistake,

00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.911
today is his birthday.

00:16:06.312 --> 00:16:10.031
The young ladies present were personally
chosen by the palace consorts.

00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:12.592
We must not show any discourtesy.

00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:17.431
This child is really...

00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:19.671
Something's wrong.

00:16:19.952 --> 00:16:20.751
Something's wrong.

00:16:21.112 --> 00:16:22.312
Madam, Master,

00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:23.271
Young Master

00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:24.391
is missing.

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.592
Missing?

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.000
Something's wrong, Young Master.

00:16:31.155 --> 00:16:31.830
Young Master.

00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.472
What happened?

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.200
Young Master.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.000
Something's wrong.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.355
Master is coming from that side.

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:37.072
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:39.431
Block that side, too!

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:43.232
You useless thing!

00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:44.151
Stop right there!

00:16:45.992 --> 00:16:46.791
This way.

00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:49.631
Careful!

00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:51.472
Careful!

00:16:53.832 --> 00:16:54.472
Young Lady!

00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.151
Young Master.

00:16:56.352 --> 00:16:56.992
Young Master.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.266
(Dancer, Weiwei)
Thank you, Young Master.

00:17:05.352 --> 00:17:06.191
No need to thank me.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.200
It's my fault you fell
into the water today.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.510
You useless thing!

00:17:10.422 --> 00:17:11.230
You useless thing!

00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:11.832
Father!

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:12.792
Go back.

00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:13.231
Your name?

00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:13.911
Go back.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:15.072
My name is Weiwei.

00:17:15.191 --> 00:17:16.072
Young Lady Weiwei.

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:17.550
I'll come to you
to formally thank you one day.

00:17:17.552 --> 00:17:18.951
You'll still want to thank her?

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:21.191
A dancer fell into the river,

00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:23.471
and you personally jumped in
to save her.

00:17:26.172 --> 00:17:28.412
(Eternal)

00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:41.671
Slowly. Be careful.

00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:43.991
Step slowly and lightly.

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.072
- Close the door.
- And lock it.

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.112
Watch him carefully.

00:17:47.951 --> 00:17:48.872
Why are you here?

00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:50.431
Young Master.

00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:52.991
We couldn't bear to see you
kneeling alone in punishment,

00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:54.990
so we came to celebrate your birthday
with you.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.112
It's numbed.

00:17:58.112 --> 00:17:59.711
You are really good to me.

00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:01.272
But

00:18:02.032 --> 00:18:03.512
you still need to be careful.

00:18:04.072 --> 00:18:05.272
Don't worry, Young Master.

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:07.032
All the people outside are ours.

00:18:07.032 --> 00:18:07.991
It's all arranged.

00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:08.872
Rest assured.

00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:10.991
That's good.

00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:13.671
My father told me to kneel
in punishment all night.

00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.991
My knees are sore and aching,
but it's nothing serious.

00:18:17.752 --> 00:18:21.792
The main thing is that this long night
is truly boring.

00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.711
I'm happy because you all came.

00:18:24.711 --> 00:18:25.631
Of course.

00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:27.072
Today is Young Master's birthday.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.471
So we celebrate.

00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:29.352
Tea.

00:18:29.352 --> 00:18:30.112
Liquor.

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:30.792
Noodles.

00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:31.231
Flowers.

00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:32.191
All are indispensable.

00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:33.312
Then let's

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:35.072
wish Young Master a long life.

00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:37.151
Bring back a fortunate young mistress
for us.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.800
- Wish Young Master a long life.
- Wish Young Master a long life.

00:18:40.312 --> 00:18:42.231
Now the second gift, Young Master,

00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:42.951
look!

00:18:42.951 --> 00:18:43.631
What is this?

00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:44.512
Liquor has arrived.

00:18:44.512 --> 00:18:46.112
It's still your favorite.

00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:47.991
Only Fuxiang truly understands me.

00:18:47.991 --> 00:18:50.951
- Happy birthday, Young Master.
- Happy birthday, Young Master.

00:18:55.032 --> 00:18:56.711
Now the kitchen fire is out.

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:57.711
So,

00:18:58.792 --> 00:19:01.431
we brought a substitute.

00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:02.151
Young Master,

00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:04.631
how about using this Xiangyun silk
to make noodles?

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.112
Elegant.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.431
Truly elegant.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:12.471
We already have the other three.

00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:14.631
And the flowers?

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.022
- Already prepared for you.
- Already prepared for you.

00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:26.872
Good!

00:19:27.191 --> 00:19:28.792
Come, let's drink together.

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.752
- Happy birthday, Young Master.
- Happy birthday, Young Master.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.312
Master.

00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:44.191
Why are you still awake?

00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:46.512
Did something happen?

00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:47.911
Tomorrow,

00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:49.951
I must go to the court.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.112
Tomorrow?

00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:52.911
So urgent?

00:19:53.072 --> 00:19:53.872
Yes.

00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:56.832
The consort has important matters
to discuss with me.

00:19:59.352 --> 00:20:00.191
Just now,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.133
you went to see that rebellious son.

00:20:04.032 --> 00:20:04.832
Master,

00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:07.151
Zhiqian is your son,

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:08.872
not a rebellious one.

00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:11.951
He is kneeling right now.

00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:13.431
Pitiful to see.

00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:14.991
Spoiling a child is like killing him.

00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:17.911
In history, Dou Yifang
spoiled King Liang.

00:20:18.512 --> 00:20:21.431
And Lv Zhi doted on King Huainan,
making him arrogant.

00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:24.832
Even as a child,

00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:26.312
he was overly spoiled.

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.352
Forming laziness and pride.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.555
He's grown up, expecting him to change

00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:32.231
is impossible.

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:34.552
Master,

00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:36.512
I understand what you mean.

00:20:36.951 --> 00:20:38.431
Zhiqian knows his mistake.

00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:39.752
He's reflecting now.

00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:42.151
The new tutor will arrive tomorrow.

00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:44.112
He will surely attend school obediently.

00:20:44.951 --> 00:20:46.512
Don't let this anger harm your health.

00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:47.552
Come, sit.

00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:51.072
Our household has misfortune.

00:20:55.352 --> 00:20:56.272
Right now,

00:20:56.911 --> 00:20:58.431
the court is in turmoil.

00:20:59.151 --> 00:21:00.711
The consort is ill again.

00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:03.552
We don't know how long
she can protect us.

00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:05.690
Now the only hope

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.552
is for Zhiqian to succeed
in the imperial exams

00:21:07.552 --> 00:21:09.191
and gain favor with His Majesty.

00:21:09.552 --> 00:21:12.711
As long as he memorizes the Four Books,

00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:15.391
that is what matters most.

00:21:15.832 --> 00:21:16.752
Yes.

00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:20.072
I will remind him.

00:21:20.592 --> 00:21:22.112
Master, have some tea.

00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:54.951
Tell me,

00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:56.711
this sentimental Young Master

00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:58.151
has been painting for hours.

00:21:58.911 --> 00:22:02.231
Young Lady Weiwei hasn't said
she's thirsty or hungry.

00:22:02.431 --> 00:22:04.312
We'd better not disturb them.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.288
Let's continue drinking our fine liquor.

00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:08.151
Here.

00:22:08.512 --> 00:22:09.391
Young Master.

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:12.552
Young Master.

00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:13.471
Something's wrong!

00:22:13.552 --> 00:22:14.229
What?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.266
My father is here again?

00:22:15.272 --> 00:22:15.911
On the way

00:22:16.352 --> 00:22:17.709
to the capital,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.866
Master Gu suddenly fell ill

00:22:18.888 --> 00:22:20.466
and died.

00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:32.832
Madam, take care of your health.

00:22:33.832 --> 00:22:34.711
Mother.

00:22:35.112 --> 00:22:37.272
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

00:22:37.352 --> 00:22:38.191
Mother.

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:40.512
How did father die?

00:22:42.312 --> 00:22:44.352
Wasn't father always healthy?

00:22:44.752 --> 00:22:45.631
How could this happen?

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:49.711
Perhaps someone didn't want
your father to enter the capital.

00:22:51.711 --> 00:22:52.872
Zhiqian,

00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:54.711
your father is gone.

00:22:54.951 --> 00:22:57.391
The backbone of our family is gone.

00:22:58.552 --> 00:22:59.431
Right now,

00:22:59.752 --> 00:23:03.431
the most important thing is
to protect the Gu family.

00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:06.552
Within Gusu City,

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:08.512
there must be someone

00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:12.391
who can safeguard us.

00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:15.512
My child.

00:23:15.951 --> 00:23:16.752
Mother.

00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:20.552
Right now, we can only rely on you.

00:23:22.072 --> 00:23:22.872
Mother,

00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:26.352
I know what to do.

00:23:46.072 --> 00:23:48.431
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

00:23:55.452 --> 00:23:57.252
(Lin Residence)

00:24:02.872 --> 00:24:03.592
Young Master Gu.

00:24:03.631 --> 00:24:05.512
My father and Master Lin
are close friends.

00:24:05.512 --> 00:24:06.911
Could you help convey the message?

00:24:06.991 --> 00:24:08.749
Master Lin is ill today.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.533
He has instructed
that no one is to see him.

00:24:20.852 --> 00:24:24.772
(Zhao Residence)

00:24:31.872 --> 00:24:33.792
Is my aunt really not at home?

00:24:33.911 --> 00:24:35.512
Yes, she really isn't.

00:24:36.631 --> 00:24:37.352
Aunt,

00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:39.312
it's your nephew, Zhiqian.

00:25:25.644 --> 00:25:27.430
You must come more often from now on.

00:25:28.977 --> 00:25:29.790
Young Master Gu.

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:30.552
Madam.

00:25:30.832 --> 00:25:31.711
Madam Lizhu.

00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:33.471
May I ask,

00:25:33.832 --> 00:25:35.151
is Lin Zhaonan here?

00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:36.951
Young Master Lin?

00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:38.352
He isn't here.

00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:40.231
Then,

00:25:40.244 --> 00:25:41.910
what about Xu Bingwen and Fang Zhiyuan?

00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:43.312
Not here either.

00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:44.592
I'll go in first.

00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:54.512
Madam Lizhu.

00:25:54.512 --> 00:25:55.991
What tune is being played?

00:25:56.112 --> 00:25:56.991
I don't understand it.

00:25:57.231 --> 00:25:58.072
Change it.

00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:00.910
Picky about words and phrases,

00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:03.112
truly think oneself a scholar,

00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:04.391
but really ridiculous.

00:26:05.032 --> 00:26:06.911
Just like Gu Zhiqian.

00:26:06.911 --> 00:26:07.389
Yes.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.266
Comes to the pleasure quarter
to write poetry,

00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:11.750
as if everyone should know
he has many poems,

00:26:11.752 --> 00:26:13.312
and his library is complete.

00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:14.991
What he writes isn't poetry,

00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.951
it's nonsense.

00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:18.991
Such a waste of
the Gu family's treasures.

00:26:19.112 --> 00:26:19.911
Perhaps,

00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:21.431
they'll all be confiscated.

00:26:22.592 --> 00:26:23.512
Listen.

00:26:23.512 --> 00:26:25.312
He came to my house a few days ago,

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.311
and had the audacity to propose
to my cousin.

00:26:27.391 --> 00:26:29.231
Luckily, my father turned him away.

00:26:29.872 --> 00:26:30.631
I heard,

00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:33.072
he went to all the prominent families
in Gusu City,

00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:35.631
and no one would accept him
as a son-in-law.

00:26:37.688 --> 00:26:38.870
Uneducated and unskilled,

00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:40.951
what use is good looks alone?

00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:42.112
Exactly.

00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:45.231
Come.

00:27:10.272 --> 00:27:11.669
Young Master,

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.400
it's been a while
since you last visited.

00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:15.592
When will you finish the painting

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:19.032
you were making for me last time?

00:27:23.352 --> 00:27:24.792
I promised to finish it for you.

00:27:25.991 --> 00:27:27.151
And I will.

00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:29.151
But,

00:27:33.792 --> 00:27:34.911
the painting isn't done,

00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:38.622
yet people and matters have changed.

00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.352
Young Master Gu, I've heard about

00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:47.533
what's been happening in your household.

00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:51.431
I hope you take care of your health.

00:27:56.512 --> 00:27:58.072
Previously, in and out of the residence,

00:28:00.072 --> 00:28:01.991
everyone cared about my health.

00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:04.711
Even a slight cough

00:28:05.272 --> 00:28:06.752
was a huge matter.

00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:10.072
But now, overnight,

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:14.872
people's hearts have changed.

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.711
I have seen it clearly now.

00:28:24.112 --> 00:28:25.431
I never studied.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.733
I don't understand poetry.

00:28:27.951 --> 00:28:31.112
Only knows that even calm rivers
have ripples.

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:35.072
I have long been accustomed

00:28:35.352 --> 00:28:37.512
to drifting like a small boat
on the water.

00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:40.151
But now,

00:28:41.072 --> 00:28:43.711
after years drifting
in the pleasure quarters,

00:28:44.991 --> 00:28:47.671
I have already grown weary of such days.

00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:50.151
Life,

00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:53.430
always has a day when tired birds
return to the forest.

00:28:57.832 --> 00:28:58.671
Young Master Gu,

00:29:02.112 --> 00:29:03.671
if you don't mind,

00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:07.552
I've already prepared some money
to redeem myself.

00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:10.032
From now on,

00:29:10.512 --> 00:29:12.191
I wish to leave the pleasure quarters

00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:13.832
and serve you in daily life.

00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:15.951
All I ask

00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:19.431
is to stay by your side.

00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:32.151
Weiwei,

00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:35.431
I promise you.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.090
I will bring you back to my residence
as soon as possible.

00:30:14.832 --> 00:30:16.592
Mother!

00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:21.431
Mother!

00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:30.191
Mother!

00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:36.792
Mother!

00:30:40.412 --> 00:30:42.252
(The entire family was executed
as a warning.)

00:30:42.276 --> 00:30:43.561
(Their property was confiscated)

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.133
(to supplement the national treasury.)

00:31:07.072 --> 00:31:07.832
Weiwei.

00:31:08.911 --> 00:31:09.872
Madam Lizhu.

00:31:10.191 --> 00:31:11.231
Why are you here?

00:31:12.752 --> 00:31:15.032
It was Young Master Gu
who asked me to give this to you.

00:31:16.752 --> 00:31:19.112
The Gu family has been executed.

00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:25.951
I heard Young Master Gu was saved
by a consort with her life,

00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:29.032
leaving him as the only descendant
of the Gu family.

00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:31.112
Don't wait any longer.

00:31:52.532 --> 00:31:54.680
(Life is like floating duckweed,
unreliable to entrust.)

00:31:54.688 --> 00:31:56.333
(Hereby farewell, please do not worry.)

00:32:54.671 --> 00:32:55.792
Huang, you passed the exam.

00:32:55.792 --> 00:32:56.911
Congratulations!

00:32:56.911 --> 00:32:57.792
You're amazing.

00:33:48.032 --> 00:33:48.991
Come, please, inside.

00:33:49.022 --> 00:33:49.550
Please, inside.

00:33:49.552 --> 00:33:50.312
Madam Lizhu.

00:33:50.312 --> 00:33:51.191
Come often.

00:33:51.832 --> 00:33:52.671
Madam Lizhu.

00:33:54.552 --> 00:33:55.711
Young Master Gu,

00:33:55.752 --> 00:33:56.671
what brings you here?

00:33:56.832 --> 00:33:57.671
May I ask,

00:33:58.072 --> 00:33:59.951
do you still remember Young Lady Weiwei?

00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:01.431
How is she now?

00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:02.312
She

00:34:02.552 --> 00:34:03.671
died long ago.

00:34:05.312 --> 00:34:06.552
How did she die?

00:34:08.071 --> 00:34:09.192
She drowned herself.

00:34:09.352 --> 00:34:11.071
I heard she was abandoned.

00:35:05.212 --> 00:35:11.572
(Gu Residence)

00:35:58.911 --> 00:36:00.071
(These paintings)

00:36:00.712 --> 00:36:02.591
(aren't of much use kept here.)

00:36:03.272 --> 00:36:04.152
(Might as well)

00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:06.192
(sell them.)

00:36:24.272 --> 00:36:24.872
This...

00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:26.752
This...

00:36:27.792 --> 00:36:28.752
Where did

00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:31.391
this wild goose come from?

00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:34.632
I never painted it.

00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:38.471
This...

00:36:40.312 --> 00:36:42.672
painting shouldn't have a wild goose.

00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:02.431
Who are you two?

00:37:03.155 --> 00:37:04.111
Sorry to bother you.

00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:05.150
Young Master Gu, sorry,

00:37:05.232 --> 00:37:06.712
we saw the door was open

00:37:06.752 --> 00:37:08.031
and didn't want to disturb you,

00:37:08.031 --> 00:37:09.111
so we waited here.

00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:10.391
Didn't scare you, did we?

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.533
No need to call me "Young Master".

00:37:16.672 --> 00:37:17.951
Call me "Scholar" instead.

00:37:18.632 --> 00:37:20.312
Why have you come here,

00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:22.312
gentlemen?

00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:26.672
We heard you excel
in both calligraphy and painting,

00:37:26.752 --> 00:37:28.431
so we wish to request
a painting from you.

00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:32.071
Excel in both calligraphy and painting?

00:37:35.352 --> 00:37:36.792
May I ask

00:37:37.312 --> 00:37:39.391
where you heard such a rumor?

00:37:39.832 --> 00:37:40.792
Coincidentally,

00:37:41.272 --> 00:37:42.551
almost all of my works

00:37:43.031 --> 00:37:44.672
have already been sold.

00:37:45.152 --> 00:37:45.991
Coincidentally,

00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:47.152
we want this one.

00:37:50.152 --> 00:37:50.991
Sorry,

00:37:51.272 --> 00:37:52.272
this one is not for sale.

00:37:52.712 --> 00:37:53.471
Why?

00:37:53.752 --> 00:37:54.632
Money isn't the issue.

00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:56.152
Not for sale means not for sale.

00:37:58.272 --> 00:38:00.111
If you have no other business,

00:38:01.272 --> 00:38:02.511
please leave.

00:38:03.471 --> 00:38:04.752
I still need to study.

00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:09.312
Scholars hate fate.

00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:12.272
Many students have
gone forward tirelessly

00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:14.792
just to earn honors one day.

00:38:15.272 --> 00:38:16.391
As a fellow scholar,

00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:19.031
I understand the difficulty you face.

00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:21.792
I hope

00:38:22.444 --> 00:38:24.150
you succeed in the imperial exam soon,

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.577
and fulfill your ambition.

00:38:26.232 --> 00:38:27.031
Farewell.

00:38:30.192 --> 00:38:30.991
Wait.

00:38:35.551 --> 00:38:36.672
Gentlemen.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.622
Are you two scholars
who have come from afar

00:38:39.752 --> 00:38:41.591
to take the imperial exam in Gusu City?

00:38:43.152 --> 00:38:44.792
Come from afar?

00:38:45.752 --> 00:38:46.872
You could say that.

00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:49.133
Coming for the exam, of course.

00:38:49.272 --> 00:38:50.872
Since we are fellow scholars,

00:38:52.111 --> 00:38:53.991
I see that it's already late today.

00:38:54.712 --> 00:38:55.272
Gentlemen,

00:38:55.872 --> 00:38:57.551
if you don't mind my humble abode,

00:38:58.272 --> 00:38:59.632
you may stay here for the night.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.933
You can prepare for the exam
together with me,

00:39:02.712 --> 00:39:03.832
and avoid

00:39:04.071 --> 00:39:05.511
the hardships of wind and rain.

00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:07.431
We shall gladly accept.

00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:08.071
Thank you.

00:39:20.431 --> 00:39:22.192
How long do we have to stay here?

00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:26.312
Until he is willing to give us
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:39:31.192 --> 00:39:31.991
Young Master Gu.

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.591
Gentlemen,

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.272
now that you are settled,

00:39:35.511 --> 00:39:36.672
it's time to study.

00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:38.352
Follow me.

00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:49.152
I have fought three battles
and retreated three times.

00:39:51.111 --> 00:39:53.192
Uncle Bao did not consider me cowardly,

00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:55.911
knowing I have an elderly mother.

00:39:56.672 --> 00:39:57.591
Young Master Gu.

00:39:57.591 --> 00:39:58.511
Your leg...

00:39:58.511 --> 00:39:59.312
It's fine.

00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:01.391
Don't be distracted.

00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:04.391
Young Master corrects mistakes

00:40:05.991 --> 00:40:07.991
and summons the reluctant to death.

00:40:08.792 --> 00:40:10.471
I was imprisoned and humiliated.

00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:14.511
I would rather be imprisoned
and humiliated

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:17.752
than die under my lord's order

00:40:18.391 --> 00:40:20.352
and serve as an enemy's tool.

00:40:20.991 --> 00:40:23.031
It is truly an unkind act.

00:40:24.951 --> 00:40:25.872
Yet,

00:40:26.832 --> 00:40:29.192
Uncle Bao did not consider it shameless,

00:40:29.752 --> 00:40:31.832
and he only corrected the small faults.

00:40:31.832 --> 00:40:32.752
He's talking himself?

00:40:32.752 --> 00:40:36.312
He felt ashamed if his achievements
were not known in the world.

00:40:38.312 --> 00:40:40.232
Tell me, all scholars in the world,

00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:44.152
who does not hope for fame
and recognition?

00:40:47.192 --> 00:40:48.152
Alas,

00:40:50.471 --> 00:40:52.192
the heart is troubled.

00:40:53.832 --> 00:40:55.752
Like unwashed clothes,

00:40:57.312 --> 00:40:59.031
thinking quietly,

00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:02.471
I cannot soar.

00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:06.991
Luckily, Guan Zhong met Uncle Bao,

00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:08.991
but I

00:41:10.071 --> 00:41:11.911
did not spare the hardships of singers.

00:41:14.352 --> 00:41:15.511
Sadly,

00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:20.232
true friends of talent are rare.

00:41:24.591 --> 00:41:25.511
How sorrowful.

00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.471
Why are you crying?

00:41:27.672 --> 00:41:28.832
Are you alright?

00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:29.872
It's fine.

00:41:31.872 --> 00:41:34.111
In books, there are houses of gold.

00:41:35.471 --> 00:41:37.632
In books, there are measures of grain.

00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:43.632
If a man fulfills his lifelong ambition,

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:46.711
he should diligently study
the Six Classics.

00:41:47.352 --> 00:41:48.189
Study by the window.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.155
He's gotten completely obsessed
with studying.

00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:51.911
Keep reading, then.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.288
I can't take it anymore.

00:42:16.511 --> 00:42:17.832
If you don't sleep soon,

00:42:17.832 --> 00:42:19.511
he'll come again to urge you to study.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.088
I've been listening to
his reading all day.

00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:23.422
Before I graduated,

00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:26.190
I had never studied this seriously.

00:42:26.591 --> 00:42:28.672
Burning the midnight oil,
rising at dawn.

00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:31.312
This is the time for a man to study.

00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:33.712
Don't waste your youth. Study early.

00:42:33.712 --> 00:42:34.511
Stop.

00:42:35.431 --> 00:42:36.629
Don't let him infect you.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.955
I don't want to hear
another classical text today.

00:42:41.152 --> 00:42:42.152
Then come here first.

00:42:51.752 --> 00:42:53.312
Gu Zhiqian's paintings

00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:55.951
are full of liveliness and energy.

00:42:56.471 --> 00:42:59.152
He must have been someone
who roamed freely

00:42:59.152 --> 00:43:00.471
among mountains and rivers.

00:43:01.632 --> 00:43:04.192
I don't know why he became
like this now.

00:43:04.991 --> 00:43:06.632
Then I also ask you,

00:43:06.632 --> 00:43:08.391
I am also lively and energetic.

00:43:08.551 --> 00:43:09.632
If this continues,

00:43:10.111 --> 00:43:11.832
I'll end up just like him.

00:43:12.352 --> 00:43:13.832
If you don't want to study,

00:43:14.071 --> 00:43:15.471
then go to sleep quickly.

00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:17.071
I need to close the window,

00:43:17.312 --> 00:43:18.312
so he won't notice.

00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:26.632
It's strange.
