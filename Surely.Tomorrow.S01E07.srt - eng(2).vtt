00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:50.473
Bye.

00:00:50.473 --> 00:00:50.573
Bye.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.994
Don't cross the Yeongdongdaegyo Bridge.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.623
Stay in Gangbuk today.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.264
-You drive.
-Okay!

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:25.524
-The seat belt.
-Okay.

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:26.734
-Done?
-Not yet. Done.

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:27.651
Okay. I'm moving off.

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:28.736
-Go. Okay.
-Let's go.

00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:48.232
What's wrong?

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.900
Wait, my foot.

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:52.152
Your foot?

00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.412
EPISODE 7

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.220
-Someone's calling to move your car.
-Okay…

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.933
Hello?

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.355
Oh, okay.

00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:20.574
Get some more sleep.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.670
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:39.635
Did he get a new car?

00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:22.678
I… Wait, no. Why… I can't breathe.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.434
But I can't breathe… Oh, wait!

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.064
Why would you choke me?

00:05:34.148 --> 00:05:36.233
You know the overwhelming force
of cuteness?

00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:40.696
It makes you want to pinch it
and hold it until it can't breathe.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.282
Like a puppy, a kitten, and a cub.

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.159
I know I'm as cute as they are.

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:46.160
Exactly.

00:05:47.953 --> 00:05:51.957
Oh, my. Wait. I can't breathe.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.170
Oh, right.

00:05:57.838 --> 00:05:59.715
Shoot. I'm going to be late for work.

00:06:01.758 --> 00:06:02.593
Hey, Kyeong-do.

00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:07.347
Don't go to work. Stay with me. Please?

00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:10.100
You're heavy.
You should prepare for the new job, too.

00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:12.644
Just for today. Please?

00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:14.646
Hey, I said you're heavy.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.564
Please?

00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:21.737
Intern.

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:24.865
Have you checked
this movie's release date?

00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:26.033
Yes.

00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:27.159
Send it to the manager.

00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:30.037
She told me to upload it
if you confirm it.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.373
"If the great assistant manager
approves it, just publish it."

00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:34.333
That's what she said.

00:06:40.964 --> 00:06:44.259
Still, let's show her one more time
before we upload it.

00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:45.385
Okay.

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.179
Where's Kim Doo-jin?

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:50.140
He probably went
to the Midlife Cop press conference.

00:06:51.308 --> 00:06:52.893
Did he have to go so early?

00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:07.658
Fuck!

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:13.622
Gotcha, you brat. Wait right there.

00:07:17.626 --> 00:07:19.544
Gosh, how did he know I was here?

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:25.884
The corporate card?

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:27.552
My personal card.

00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.183
Did you think I'd give up
if you avoided me?

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:36.103
I wasn't avoiding you.
I came here to work.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:37.854
Three hours before the press conference?

00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:42.442
What are you doing here?
You're a little too high up to be here.

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.528
I'm here to catch you, you punk.

00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.281
I even gave up on my lunch hour
to be here.

00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:49.157
So why? Why is that?

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:51.702
An Da-hye. Why did you start covering her?

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:55.122
It's wrong for a reporter to demand
another reporter to reveal the informant.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:57.874
It's suspicious.
Why is An Da-hye looking for you?

00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.128
And why are you avoiding me?
That's because you're hiding something.

00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:04.923
That's not it. I was covering it honestly.

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:07.426
And besides, you can't do this.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:10.053
You're taking it personally
because she's your ex.

00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:13.390
What do you mean, "No"?

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:15.600
My current girlfriend.

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:20.147
Oh, that day.

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.775
When Seo Ji-woo said in the lobby
she was wearing your underwear…

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.862
I knew there was something.

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.740
Same here.
I think there is something going on.

00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:34.161
I'm personally very curious.
I'll keep it to myself. Who was it?

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:35.871
But--

00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:38.332
INCOMING CALL
SEO JI-YEON

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:40.584
Answer your phone.

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:42.961
It's your sister-in-law.

00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:46.465
Keep acting cheeky,
and you'll be in big trouble.

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:48.258
Yes, hello?

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:51.470
Yes.

00:08:53.513 --> 00:08:55.349
Isn't Excel one of the basic skills?

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:57.934
I'm learning, but it's too hard.

00:08:58.018 --> 00:08:59.186
You're learn…

00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:03.982
If you keep doing this,
they won't stop calling you a free rider.

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:05.650
Okay.

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:06.860
"Okay"?

00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:09.237
-It's not "okay." You--
-We have a guest.

00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:18.455
Hello. Ms. Seo will be here shortly.

00:09:18.997 --> 00:09:20.665
-I'll have you wait inside.
-Okay.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:22.709
Bring tea.

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.383
What would you like to drink?

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:32.010
Well, a hot Americano will do.

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:50.320
Shit. How much longer
do I have to keep this up?

00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:53.573
How long do I have to
put up with that old fossil?

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:04.501
Thank you.

00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:08.713
Wait, why are you drinking that?

00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:16.221
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking--

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:19.266
That's Ms. Seo's.
Why would you drink that?

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:25.480
I'm sorry about that,
but why would you get so upset over this?

00:10:28.024 --> 00:10:29.985
Sorry about that. The meeting ran over.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.570
No, I just got here too.

00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:33.989
Ms. Seo, I'll bring you new coffee.

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:40.537
Kang Min-woo…

00:10:41.663 --> 00:10:43.290
Your husband was the informant?

00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:44.666
Yes.

00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:48.712
But why…

00:10:50.297 --> 00:10:53.300
But it only makes sense
if he can benefit from it.

00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:56.011
What would he get
from getting rid of Cho Jin-eon?

00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:59.181
With him present,
it's hard for him to sell the company.

00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:03.101
The executives were complimenting Jin-eon
for his performance.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:04.978
Sell the company?

00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:09.441
That's the reason he's pretending
to ignore my illness as well.

00:11:10.817 --> 00:11:12.944
He's not interested
in running the company.

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:17.532
He'll reveal my illness
at a crucial moment

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:20.702
and make people think that there's no one
to run the company.

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.914
Then he'll step forward
to sell the company.

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:28.543
Because once I lose all my memories,
he'll be my representative.

00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:31.838
It seems he's already found a buyer.

00:11:31.922 --> 00:11:34.758
My goodness. He's a real scary guy.

00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:37.594
Then Ji-woo…

00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:38.929
That's why I'm worried.

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:43.975
Ji-woo will have to go through all this.
I'm worried.

00:11:45.227 --> 00:11:48.313
I even wonder if I'm being selfish.

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:53.985
I'm worried
if Ji-woo could put up with all this.

00:11:55.153 --> 00:11:57.405
I feel bad for her, and I pity her.

00:11:59.574 --> 00:12:01.451
Is this why you haven't told her yet?

00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:05.705
If she finds out that I have dementia,
Ji-woo will fall apart.

00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:09.167
Now that I've talked to her in person,

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:13.964
it turns out she's relying on me so much
when I'm not so reliable.

00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:21.054
If there's anything I can help you with,
I'll do my best.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.160
About the secretary
who was just here earlier.

00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:45.537
You mean Secretary Yoo?

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.748
Yes, did she join the company
through an open recruitment?

00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:49.958
Why do you ask?

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:53.878
Because I think
I heard her being a free rider.

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:56.965
She graduated
from my father-in-law's school.

00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:58.300
My husband recommended her.

00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:05.181
Can you get me a change of clothes?

00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:06.850
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.145
Wait, why are you drinking that?

00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:13.273
That's Ms. Seo's.
Why would you drink that?

00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:32.292
So I can drink it later.
This place makes good coffee.

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.002
I'll ask her to make a new one--

00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:35.879
Oh, no. This will do.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.840
What were you thinking to show up here?

00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:40.842
I can't do this.

00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:47.307
How long do I have to do this for?
The chief secretary is driving me crazy.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.142
You didn't anticipate this?

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:53.188
That as well, but this is too dangerous.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:57.692
What if Ms. Seo ends up dying?
What is that drug?

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.571
If this goes wrong,
I'll end up going to prison.

00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:03.865
Lower your voice.

00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:07.827
Why don't you be more direct?

00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:09.245
You want more money.

00:14:14.334 --> 00:14:16.378
Okay. Go back to work.

00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:19.172
And...

00:14:20.882 --> 00:14:22.217
don't you ever come here.

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:24.260
Because your second phone is off--

00:14:24.344 --> 00:14:26.304
If you have anything to say, text me.

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:28.098
I'll check more often.

00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:30.016
Thank you.

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:32.769
Have a good day.

00:14:40.652 --> 00:14:41.486
Hey, Seong-sik.

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:45.782
When you did the article about juice,
where did you get the analysis done?

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:50.704
Oh, really? Can you send me the link?

00:14:51.788 --> 00:14:52.914
Yeah, thanks.

00:14:58.753 --> 00:14:59.921
Here.

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:04.592
Can you analyze any elements
that are harmful,

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:06.761
or would induce illnesses,

00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:10.807
or anything that is not found
in ordinary coffee?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.975
Sure, I'll do that.

00:15:12.058 --> 00:15:14.227
Well, how long is it going to take?

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.521
Normally, it takes about
two to three weeks.

00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:19.858
Okay, then...

00:15:21.443 --> 00:15:24.821
I have to write an article.
So if you could rush a bit…

00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:26.948
Please?

00:15:27.031 --> 00:15:28.283
Okay, I'll try my best.

00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:29.617
Okay, thank you.

00:15:31.411 --> 00:15:33.288
SUBWAY EXIT

00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:51.055
FLOWERS

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:52.140
Hello.

00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:53.057
Hello.

00:15:59.105 --> 00:15:59.939
Mom.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:01.733
Well, thanks.

00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:08.448
You've never done this before.

00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:10.867
I told you a million times
that I like flowers,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.577
but you only got me carnations.

00:16:14.287 --> 00:16:15.288
I remembered it today.

00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:20.251
-Next time, buy half of these.
-Okay.

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:22.420
Go.

00:16:22.504 --> 00:16:24.297
Mom, where are you headed?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.590
Tuesday service.

00:16:29.552 --> 00:16:31.387
Why does she keep taking this route?

00:16:39.813 --> 00:16:41.147
Where did you get the flowers?

00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:43.316
-My son got them for me.
-You raised him well.

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.486
I fed him mostly rice,
and he grew up well.

00:16:49.572 --> 00:16:49.605
Beer is the best with pizza.

00:16:49.605 --> 00:16:51.032
Beer is the best with pizza.

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:52.242
SPARKLING WATER

00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:53.660
That is impossible.

00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:55.036
-Exactly.
-Right?

00:16:56.412 --> 00:16:57.288
Here.

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:04.921
By the way, I found a flower shop
on my way home.

00:17:05.004 --> 00:17:07.799
I've never noticed it,
but it's been there for four years.

00:17:07.882 --> 00:17:10.510
What, you're hinting
that you've never been in a relationship?

00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:15.890
Apparently, orange roses exist.

00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:18.059
You should've bought one.

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:19.727
One? I bought 20.

00:17:19.811 --> 00:17:20.645
What?

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:26.234
-They were taken away instantly.
-Damn it, by which jerk?

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:27.610
My mom.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.490
Hey, come here.

00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:34.784
Bring your face over here.

00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:37.412
You're a reporter.
Don't leave out the subject when you talk.

00:17:37.495 --> 00:17:38.788
Why are you so sensitive?

00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.837
No, it's just…

00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:48.089
You know...

00:17:48.965 --> 00:17:50.717
-Listen to me.
-Okay.

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:54.762
I was told to take a photo
for the press release.

00:17:57.724 --> 00:17:58.766
But what is this?

00:18:01.144 --> 00:18:02.020
It's a good picture.

00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:05.189
But it looks unnatural.
What is good about this typical pose?

00:18:05.273 --> 00:18:06.316
What do you want then?

00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:08.693
You know, like this, right?

00:18:08.776 --> 00:18:13.573
I'm on my way to work, I turn around,
and snap. I turn around, and snap.

00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:17.702
Just like that.
You know what I mean, right?

00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:19.078
No? Right?

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:21.247
Yeah, you mean like,

00:18:22.123 --> 00:18:25.460
the daughters-in-law of major corporations
attending a wedding?

00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:27.587
Yes, exactly!

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.174
What is this boring picture? Gosh…

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:33.885
Shall we go out?
Let's take a few on Teheran-ro.

00:18:35.887 --> 00:18:36.971
So I was thinking…

00:18:37.055 --> 00:18:38.014
Yes?

00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:41.893
I'm going to the company
to meet my sister before I start.

00:18:42.352 --> 00:18:44.646
You should take a picture of me then.

00:18:44.729 --> 00:18:49.233
Just keep taking candid pictures.
Then we might get a good one.

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:54.489
Me? The assistant manager
of Dongwoon Daily?

00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:55.657
Yes, you.

00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:07.835
Then how are you going to get there?
By taxi? That's weird.

00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:11.339
Taxi? Oh, right. That's kind of unnatural.

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.967
But if I drive…

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.386
I can't get it valet-parked.

00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:21.099
I should've listened to my sister
when she said she'd assign me a chauffeur.

00:19:21.182 --> 00:19:24.477
Dang, a director even gets a chauffeur?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.939
Why did you say no?
It's convenient to have a chauffeur.

00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:32.485
Not convenient at all. It's suffocating
to be with a stranger in a car.

00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:33.778
I'd get carsick.

00:19:40.743 --> 00:19:43.204
Hey, just use this. It's a good picture.

00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:45.665
You look like you'll work like a cow.

00:19:45.748 --> 00:19:49.502
"Moo, the director is working. Moo."

00:19:50.003 --> 00:19:51.713
"Give me work. Moo."

00:19:52.255 --> 00:19:53.172
What?

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:55.341
You open your mouth.

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:57.593
You open first. You first.

00:19:57.677 --> 00:19:59.971
Then… Oh, wait.

00:20:02.598 --> 00:20:03.474
Hey, Jeong-min.

00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:05.393
Me?

00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:08.438
Well, I'm home. I'm chilling.

00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:09.856
You're chilling with Ji-woo.

00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:13.276
We're having dinner together.

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:15.486
Both of you, come to Woo-sik's place now.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.404
Now?

00:20:17.321 --> 00:20:18.364
Jeong-min, hello?

00:20:20.575 --> 00:20:21.993
-What's that about?
-What?

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.161
He said to come now.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:26.622
Who are you to fool me?

00:20:27.248 --> 00:20:31.294
"Yes, Jeong-min. Yes. I'm chilling.
I'm home." That was too awkward.

00:20:31.377 --> 00:20:33.421
You know Kyeong-do can't do method acting.

00:20:33.504 --> 00:20:36.049
When he said, "Oh, Jeong-min,"

00:20:36.132 --> 00:20:39.343
I knew right away that he was with Ji-woo.

00:20:39.427 --> 00:20:43.014
Right. Why did you stutter? Do you feel
uncomfortable getting back together?

00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:45.349
When did I talk like that?

00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:48.436
Is Uncle Kyeong-do going out with you?

00:20:49.312 --> 00:20:52.231
-Don't we look good together?
-Date for a long time without fighting.

00:20:53.316 --> 00:20:54.150
Sure.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.319
We will. Thanks.

00:20:56.986 --> 00:21:01.074
We should have some soju, no?
This annoying little couple. Right?

00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:03.743
This pairs well with whiskey too.

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:08.122
Just feel free to drink. I won't come here
if you keep doing this.

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:09.499
Still, you idiot.

00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:12.752
If you say that,
I'll find this in my bag. Look…

00:21:17.673 --> 00:21:19.383
Drink it alone at home.

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:22.136
Whiskey pairs well with solitude.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.640
I knew Se-yeong was the only loyal friend.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.477
When I was in the army,
she was the only one who visited me.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.022
You guys never came. Only bought me drinks
when I was out on a break.

00:21:33.856 --> 00:21:35.316
Hey, this is really good.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.693
You went to meet him alone?

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.280
-Yes.
-Why?

00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:44.951
Oh, well, just to see
if Kyeong-do was doing okay.

00:21:45.034 --> 00:21:47.578
I was worried. That's why. Is it good?

00:21:47.662 --> 00:21:49.747
But we didn't even get to meet, did we?

00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:51.415
What? Yeah, right.

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:53.376
Because I had to drive the commander.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.337
So, why were you curious
about Kyeong-do's condition?

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.134
Hey, what kind of question is that?
What are you trying to say?

00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:06.681
Were you worried about him that much?

00:22:06.764 --> 00:22:10.601
This is serious. When things get serious,
you become curious. Do you want this?

00:22:10.685 --> 00:22:12.353
At the time,

00:22:12.436 --> 00:22:15.857
he got wasted and returned to his base
early in the morning.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.441
That's when. You eat it.

00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:20.444
A day like that happened a lot.
It's normal to be curious.

00:22:20.528 --> 00:22:24.115
No, oh, seriously.
It was the day of Ji-yeon's wedding!

00:22:24.949 --> 00:22:25.950
Don't you remember?

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.877
WINTER, 2009

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.963
I never asked you for a favor.
Switch with me just once, please?

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:41.007
But I booked a concert ticket.

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:45.344
I'll pay for the ticket. And I'll take you
to another one when we're discharged.

00:22:46.596 --> 00:22:48.389
No way. Never.

00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:52.059
I'll take your driving shift next weekend.

00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:55.605
Wait. I'll drive every weekend this month.
What do you say? Are you in?

00:22:55.688 --> 00:22:56.814
-For real?
-For real.

00:23:00.276 --> 00:23:01.152
Okay.

00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.236
Okay.

00:23:06.908 --> 00:23:08.826
After your sister's wedding,

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.621
we might as well visit Kyeong-do
while you're here.

00:23:12.038 --> 00:23:13.915
Do you think he'd be happy to see me?

00:23:15.708 --> 00:23:17.501
He'd get pissed off and desert the army.

00:23:19.921 --> 00:23:22.757
Then by chance… by any chance,

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:25.092
if Kyeong-do's out on a break?

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:26.886
If he happens to be out

00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:30.431
on the day of your sister's wedding,

00:23:30.514 --> 00:23:32.934
let's meet him. Okay?

00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:35.019
That's worth trying.

00:23:36.187 --> 00:23:37.980
Did you tell him that I was coming?

00:23:39.148 --> 00:23:39.982
No!

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:43.819
Se-yeong.

00:23:43.903 --> 00:23:47.031
Don't look at me like that.
That gives me butterflies in the stomach.

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:52.411
Do you

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:56.332
want me to get back with Kyeong-do?

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:02.046
You know what?

00:24:03.923 --> 00:24:05.883
I think everyone
should have a good breakup.

00:24:06.676 --> 00:24:10.471
That way, they're either sad or relieved.

00:24:11.681 --> 00:24:13.391
But you and Kyeong-do?

00:24:14.392 --> 00:24:16.811
It's not a matter of
getting back together.

00:24:17.812 --> 00:24:19.355
I want you to break up properly.

00:24:25.486 --> 00:24:27.405
You're really eloquent, Se-yeong.

00:24:27.488 --> 00:24:29.699
Like a teacher.
I don't understand a thing.

00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:32.702
Focus.

00:24:45.172 --> 00:24:47.675
Hello. Can you show me your invitation?

00:24:48.175 --> 00:24:49.969
Oh, the invitation, sir?

00:24:50.052 --> 00:24:51.887
You cannot enter without an invitation.

00:24:52.388 --> 00:24:53.764
Oh, okay, sir.

00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:44.982
Here, cheers!

00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:46.192
Drink.

00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:52.531
Are you sure Ji-woo's back in Korea?
How come she wasn't at the wedding?

00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:56.494
Maybe there was a separate entrance
for the family. The hotel was huge.

00:25:57.036 --> 00:25:58.662
Hey, how did you know

00:25:58.746 --> 00:26:01.707
Ji-woo's sister was getting married?
Did you read the article?

00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:04.543
No, Se-yeong told me
there was an article about it.

00:26:05.378 --> 00:26:06.754
That Ji-woo might come.

00:26:08.714 --> 00:26:12.760
I mean, there is no way to reach her.
It'd be nice to run into her like this.

00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:15.846
Even from Ji-woo's point of view,
it'd be worth the long flight.

00:26:17.348 --> 00:26:19.725
Right. It'd be nice to see him
while she's here.

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:21.519
Then, shall we call JARIM Apparel?

00:26:22.144 --> 00:26:26.065
That we'd like to know
the second daughter's contact information?

00:26:26.148 --> 00:26:27.358
What do you think?

00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:30.194
I'm just saying because I feel for him.
Don't be so serious.

00:26:31.404 --> 00:26:32.488
My goodness.

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:35.783
Anyway, when are you two joining the army?

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:39.078
When I'm discharged,
you should go right away.

00:26:40.788 --> 00:26:41.831
I'll take care of her.

00:26:42.415 --> 00:26:44.291
Who are you to take care of Se-yeong?

00:26:50.756 --> 00:26:53.884
Do you like Park Se-yeong?

00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:59.557
I ship it.

00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:03.519
Hey, if you two start dating,

00:27:04.145 --> 00:27:06.856
Chaos is doomed, you know?

00:27:06.939 --> 00:27:10.901
It's enough with Lee Kyeong-do
and Seo Ji-woo. Right, Se-yeong? Yeah?

00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:13.154
Then we shouldn't break up.

00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:16.532
This asshole… He's serious.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.077
Kyeong-do, get up.

00:27:39.388 --> 00:27:41.056
See the look in his eyes?

00:27:41.724 --> 00:27:44.059
I'm glad I'm out on a break.
This is so worth it.

00:27:44.143 --> 00:27:46.937
Worth it, my ass!
This is harmful, Woo-sik.

00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:49.023
Think about it carefully.

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:52.359
Hey! You asshole, you're too drunk.

00:27:52.443 --> 00:27:54.695
What the hell is wrong with him? Hey.

00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:00.743
If you drink this, we're going out.

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:09.210
Wait, what the hell?

00:28:09.293 --> 00:28:11.170
Look at them. What are you…

00:28:11.253 --> 00:28:14.590
Hey, we only met because of theater.
This club was only meant for theater.

00:28:14.673 --> 00:28:16.217
This club wasn't for dating.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.094
You idiot.
Why the hell are you snickering?

00:28:19.178 --> 00:28:20.429
Congratulations, sir.

00:28:20.513 --> 00:28:23.974
What? Don't be ridiculous.
Are you here to date?

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:28.270
You assholes… Just me alone…
What, is this a dating republic or what?

00:28:40.908 --> 00:28:42.952
Cheers!

00:29:53.147 --> 00:29:56.066
SE-YEONG

00:30:01.405 --> 00:30:02.781
Hey, Se-yeong.

00:30:08.037 --> 00:30:09.705
No, I was about to get up.

00:30:09.788 --> 00:30:14.293
Yeah. Why didn't you come yesterday?
Everyone was waiting for you.

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:17.504
I was with my family until late.

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:21.383
I see. Are you in the hotel?

00:30:21.467 --> 00:30:22.301
Yes.

00:30:24.428 --> 00:30:27.473
Now that Ji-yeon isn't home,
you're not going home at all?

00:30:32.811 --> 00:30:35.105
Did Kyeong-do get home safely last night?

00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:38.734
I hope so? He was probably with
Woo-sik and Jeong-min last night.

00:30:39.485 --> 00:30:40.361
I see.

00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:46.659
Se-yeong.

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:51.997
Where is Kyeong-do stationed?

00:30:52.831 --> 00:30:55.084
BAEKGEOM BASE
CHECKPOINT

00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:58.003
VISITOR REQUEST
NAME: LEE KYEONG-DO

00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:15.729
Wait. You cannot visit
Sergeant Lee Kyeong-do today, ma'am.

00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:19.024
-Why not?
-He's on an off-base dispatch.

00:31:23.779 --> 00:31:26.490
CHECKPOINT

00:31:35.749 --> 00:31:38.877
MILITARY BASE ENTRANCE

00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:11.076
Hey, Se-yeong. It's me, Kyeong-do.

00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:14.496
Did you happen to visit me today?

00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:20.127
I was told that a girl my age visited,
but he doesn't know the name.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.755
Was it you?

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:27.551
Oh, yes. It was me.

00:32:28.594 --> 00:32:30.554
Really? But we met yesterday.

00:32:30.929 --> 00:32:34.767
Well, since you drank a lot.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.893
I was worried.

00:32:38.103 --> 00:32:41.106
Worried if you were struggling
because you didn't see Ji-woo.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.108
I just went to check on you.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.530
It's only your second day with Woo-sik.
I'm causing you trouble.

00:32:49.907 --> 00:32:53.202
Right. Hey, speaking of which…

00:32:55.621 --> 00:32:57.039
I was too drunk.

00:32:59.249 --> 00:33:01.835
Kyeong-do, do you think
I'm making the right choice?

00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:04.254
What if my life is doomed?

00:33:05.047 --> 00:33:06.340
Hey, that hurts.

00:33:06.715 --> 00:33:09.593
Then explain that sweet look in your eyes
last night.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.428
Woo-sik is kind of cute.

00:33:14.223 --> 00:33:16.099
Yeah, right. You make a good couple.

00:33:30.989 --> 00:33:34.201
Happy? That I went to the wedding
to see you and got kicked out?

00:33:34.284 --> 00:33:36.286
Yes, I'm so damn happy.

00:33:37.079 --> 00:33:38.330
I'm so damn happy too.

00:33:39.414 --> 00:33:41.708
Because it was actually me
who visited you?

00:33:43.293 --> 00:33:44.127
Yes.

00:33:45.587 --> 00:33:46.421
Come here.

00:33:56.557 --> 00:33:58.559
Artist Choi is in a relationship, right?

00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:02.354
Gosh.

00:34:04.106 --> 00:34:07.651
Why would you cut in without a blinker?
You startled me.

00:34:08.318 --> 00:34:11.363
They already broke up, right?
It feels like this scandal is too late.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.910
I don't know. I'd like to know as well.

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:20.706
If you cover it,
promise me to let me know, okay?

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.166
You're good.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.044
With the CEO title and a bigger paycheck,
you're not feeling up to it?

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:31.133
Excuse me.

00:34:33.427 --> 00:34:34.303
Hello?

00:34:35.178 --> 00:34:37.806
Yeah, I'm eating right now.
Have you had lunch yet?

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.101
I already have.
Do you want to come home tonight?

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.438
I'll boil a whole Korean chicken,
but it's too much for us.

00:34:44.521 --> 00:34:48.817
Leftovers always end up in the trash.
It's nice to eat together when it's hot.

00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:51.028
I love baeksuk.

00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:57.326
But I have to cover
a movie press conference tonight.

00:34:58.243 --> 00:35:00.829
Leave some for me, Mom.
I'll eat it tomorrow.

00:35:00.913 --> 00:35:03.290
Baeksuk is still tasty
even when it's reheated.

00:35:03.373 --> 00:35:06.793
Yes. I'll call you. Yeah. Enjoy.

00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:09.922
What movie press conference?

00:35:10.505 --> 00:35:12.382
As far as I know, there's nothing tonight.

00:35:12.925 --> 00:35:13.759
Eat.

00:35:13.842 --> 00:35:16.094
Wait. I'm smelling something.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.889
It's the jjajangmyeon smell.
Yeah, keep eating.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.393
It's not this smell, though.

00:35:23.477 --> 00:35:24.561
Does he have work?

00:35:24.645 --> 00:35:27.105
Yeah, I guess he's going somewhere
for an article.

00:35:27.522 --> 00:35:30.901
Why are you worried about Kyeong-do
so much lately?

00:35:30.984 --> 00:35:32.569
I'm not worried about him.

00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:36.698
Not many sons buy their moms flowers.

00:35:37.532 --> 00:35:42.245
Do you think he bought them for me?
He bought them for the person he likes.

00:35:42.955 --> 00:35:45.540
Wait. If you knew, why did you take them?

00:35:45.624 --> 00:35:48.377
What else? How was I supposed to ask him?

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.463
"Is someone at home?
Why are you buying flowers after work?"

00:35:51.546 --> 00:35:53.382
Was I supposed to ask? And embarrass him?

00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:56.677
Right, you have a point. My goodness.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.804
If it withers again…

00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:03.850
He'd be heartbroken.
I'm worried about that.

00:36:04.726 --> 00:36:08.438
Back then, I was ill.
That probably made it worse.

00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:21.118
ORGANIZATION CHART

00:36:21.201 --> 00:36:23.954
She is our lead designer,
Department Manager Ji Yeon-soo.

00:36:24.621 --> 00:36:26.206
She worked with Dad for a long time.

00:36:27.249 --> 00:36:29.584
It's important
to make her your person first.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.962
She will help you a lot.

00:36:32.713 --> 00:36:34.965
She was born in 1974. Okay.

00:36:35.549 --> 00:36:37.467
Don't just look at the pictures.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.511
Next is…

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.724
Yes. Executive Director Choi.
You need to watch out for her a little.

00:36:44.474 --> 00:36:45.767
-Is she a villain?
-No.

00:36:47.144 --> 00:36:48.228
She's not like that.

00:36:48.311 --> 00:36:49.563
Then why do I need to watch out?

00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:53.025
Should I say she's on the border?

00:36:53.108 --> 00:36:56.319
She doesn't care about loyalty
or comradeship.

00:36:56.862 --> 00:36:59.948
Her priority is her own benefit.

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:02.701
So she's made contributions
to the company.

00:37:03.785 --> 00:37:05.996
Between a villain and a helper. Okay.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:13.795
I plan to release the press release
the day after tomorrow.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.137
-Do you feel pressured?
-No, that's not it.

00:37:23.263 --> 00:37:25.682
I just don't really like that picture.

00:37:26.683 --> 00:37:28.351
Do you want me to get a new photographer?

00:37:28.435 --> 00:37:30.604
No worries. It'll be the same anyway.

00:37:30.687 --> 00:37:33.398
They'll make me turn slightly on the chair
and smile like this.

00:37:36.735 --> 00:37:37.861
What is that?

00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:39.905
Oh, gosh.

00:37:39.988 --> 00:37:41.198
Is that how I look also?

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.617
-Is it from the same place?
-Yes.

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:46.703
Kind of.
I look like a cow who'd only work.

00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:51.416
Right? Excuse me.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.417
Sure.

00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:55.378
LEE KYEONG-DO

00:37:56.421 --> 00:37:57.714
Hey, I'm at work.

00:37:57.798 --> 00:38:01.676
Wow, so cool. "I'm at work." Dang.

00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:04.096
I'm busy, so I have to go.
I'll call you back.

00:38:08.141 --> 00:38:09.601
I sounded pretty cool, right?

00:38:10.185 --> 00:38:11.645
Director Seo.

00:38:20.612 --> 00:38:21.446
Gosh.

00:39:06.074 --> 00:39:07.784
What are you doing here?

00:39:07.868 --> 00:39:09.911
Well… Because I missed you?

00:39:12.831 --> 00:39:14.708
This feels so nice, Kyeong-do.

00:39:26.887 --> 00:39:28.138
Are you coming from work?

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:30.640
No, I'm coming from your house.

00:39:30.724 --> 00:39:34.102
What? Then you should've stayed home.
You must be tired.

00:39:35.395 --> 00:39:38.940
There are days
I feel like I have to pick you up.

00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:41.526
For example?

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:44.446
A day like today?

00:39:46.698 --> 00:39:48.200
What is a day like today?

00:39:49.242 --> 00:39:52.579
That prick who should be turned down
by all the door locks in the world.

00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:54.331
What?

00:39:58.084 --> 00:39:59.085
What the hell?

00:40:06.426 --> 00:40:10.013
Shit. Hey! Fuck.

00:40:11.806 --> 00:40:12.807
What are you doing?

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.065
So laid-back.
Some might think this is your house.

00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:24.903
Because I'm done flirting.
What are you doing at other people's home?

00:40:24.986 --> 00:40:27.197
The door code. Did you change it?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.157
Why do you care who changed it?

00:40:29.241 --> 00:40:32.035
What matters is
that you're violating the law.

00:40:33.203 --> 00:40:35.247
-This is a crime.
-Hey! Fuck.

00:40:36.957 --> 00:40:38.041
Will you press the button?

00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:43.630
Hey, I know you set me up with An Da-hye
to get me divorced.

00:40:43.713 --> 00:40:45.966
You got rid of me to approach Seo Ji-woo!

00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:51.263
I want to show off that I was the one
who tried to stop the article.

00:40:51.721 --> 00:40:53.098
Don't be ridiculous.

00:40:53.181 --> 00:40:55.100
Why would I listen
to a trash reporter like you?

00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:59.980
If I were you,
I'd look into the informant first.

00:41:00.981 --> 00:41:03.733
Besides, let's use honorifics from now on.

00:41:03.817 --> 00:41:06.403
We're not close.
Being casual with you gives me goosebumps.

00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:08.530
Right. Yes. Right.

00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:10.448
Yeah, the informant.

00:41:10.532 --> 00:41:11.741
Jeez.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.203
I get it. It was Seo Ji-woo.

00:41:15.287 --> 00:41:16.288
Gosh.

00:41:16.371 --> 00:41:19.958
I'm onto you two. I heard
Seo Ji-woo's working at the company now.

00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:23.003
I'll send both of you to hell
as soon as I can. You hear me?

00:41:23.086 --> 00:41:25.463
I said use honorifics.
You're not fucking listening.

00:41:25.547 --> 00:41:27.382
You son of a--

00:41:27.465 --> 00:41:30.135
I wouldn't even set up a blind date
for a dick like you.

00:41:31.094 --> 00:41:32.220
Such a loser.

00:41:45.108 --> 00:41:46.401
Fuck.

00:41:59.122 --> 00:42:00.081
What is this?

00:42:00.165 --> 00:42:00.999
Give it to her.

00:42:11.718 --> 00:42:14.220
You have to be
straightforward with him, okay?

00:42:14.304 --> 00:42:18.308
He kept pressing the door code
as if this were his house. That jackass…

00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:22.562
That was the real reason
you felt like you had to pick me up.

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:24.314
-Right?
-No!

00:42:24.397 --> 00:42:26.232
You're yelling, so I'm right.

00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:28.651
Probably not.

00:42:43.792 --> 00:42:45.418
Is he out of his mind?

00:42:56.846 --> 00:42:58.515
What is it? What did that lunatic say?

00:42:58.598 --> 00:43:00.475
-Can I have any privacy?
-Not on this.

00:43:03.103 --> 00:43:06.606
"My second proposal to you!"
That son of a bitch!

00:43:08.066 --> 00:43:10.402
Wow, this guy's got no brain.

00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:12.112
Is divorce a joke?

00:43:12.195 --> 00:43:14.572
So cringe. A second proposal?

00:43:15.156 --> 00:43:18.201
I should've punched that prick
in the throat, shit.

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:22.497
Hey, I can't let this slide.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.958
Give me his number.
You won't be able to do it.

00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:27.794
I'll meet him and draw the line clearly.

00:43:27.877 --> 00:43:29.254
I'll meet him and return it.

00:43:29.337 --> 00:43:31.256
Why? Just call a quick delivery service.

00:43:31.339 --> 00:43:34.884
You can't find this in Korea.

00:43:34.968 --> 00:43:36.511
Things will get worse if it got lost.

00:43:37.345 --> 00:43:38.263
Wow.

00:43:38.805 --> 00:43:41.766
This guy knew what he was doing. Right?

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:45.520
He knew if he got you something expensive,
he'd get to see you again.

00:43:45.603 --> 00:43:46.980
He calculated it.

00:43:48.648 --> 00:43:50.859
Have you ever seen a dog with rabies?

00:43:50.942 --> 00:43:51.943
No!

00:43:52.026 --> 00:43:53.486
I think I'm seeing one now.

00:43:59.033 --> 00:44:00.243
This is how he is.

00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:03.329
Once he's fixated on something,
he decides he's right.

00:44:04.122 --> 00:44:07.625
Still, I feel a little bad
for my Kyeong-do.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.170
You must've been upset to be given this.

00:44:12.172 --> 00:44:14.340
Still, I got under his skin.

00:44:14.424 --> 00:44:16.468
I covered it when I punched the door code.

00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:17.635
I bet he was upset.

00:44:19.804 --> 00:44:20.638
Come here.

00:44:23.975 --> 00:44:25.143
Where can you buy that?

00:44:26.686 --> 00:44:27.520
I don't know.

00:44:27.604 --> 00:44:28.438
How much is it?

00:44:30.148 --> 00:44:30.982
Come here.

00:44:31.941 --> 00:44:34.319
Don't move for five minutes.
I need to recharge.

00:45:41.469 --> 00:45:48.309
SUMMER, 2015

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.580
This design is popular for matching rings.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.375
This has diamonds,
so the ladies prefer this.

00:46:54.459 --> 00:46:56.294
Do you have anything simple?

00:46:57.128 --> 00:46:58.838
If the jewels are too flashy…

00:47:03.509 --> 00:47:04.719
How about this?

00:47:06.054 --> 00:47:06.888
I'll take this.

00:47:06.971 --> 00:47:08.181
Do you know her size?

00:47:15.104 --> 00:47:17.023
Do you see the knot?

00:47:18.316 --> 00:47:19.150
Excellent.

00:47:45.176 --> 00:47:47.261
Aren't you tired? Do you want to go home?

00:47:49.222 --> 00:47:51.766
I'm okay. Do you want me
to get something to drink?

00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:53.851
No, I've already had enough.

00:47:55.186 --> 00:47:57.021
Hey, how about a drive this weekend?

00:47:58.606 --> 00:47:59.941
-No.
-Why not?

00:48:01.984 --> 00:48:05.780
This Saturday…
we're going to a fancy restaurant.

00:48:05.863 --> 00:48:07.865
Really? What? Where?

00:48:09.158 --> 00:48:11.160
I found a nice Korean restaurant.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:14.247
Why? Is it some kind of an anniversary?

00:48:16.499 --> 00:48:17.583
A day to have great food.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.170
Great food…

00:48:27.552 --> 00:48:28.428
Hey, Mom.

00:48:29.887 --> 00:48:32.140
Dad? How serious?

00:48:33.182 --> 00:48:38.229
Which hospital? Okay. Bye.

00:49:10.136 --> 00:49:12.889
FRAGILE

00:50:57.618 --> 00:51:00.162
Maybe he's still high from the drugs.

00:51:00.246 --> 00:51:03.791
What's this bullshit, a second proposal?

00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:05.293
What does he take Ji-woo for?

00:51:05.376 --> 00:51:07.336
You don't treat someone right
when they're with you.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.589
Once they're gone, running after them
just makes you sweat.

00:51:09.672 --> 00:51:12.842
If he was nice to her when he had her,
these two wouldn't be together.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.305
Read the room, please.

00:51:17.847 --> 00:51:19.056
What I'm saying is,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.769
am I the only one who doesn't understand
that asshole's second proposal?

00:51:23.853 --> 00:51:24.729
That is my question.

00:51:24.812 --> 00:51:26.564
Reunited couples can be happy.

00:51:26.647 --> 00:51:27.607
Damn it.

00:51:32.695 --> 00:51:34.363
Get her a gift too.

00:51:34.447 --> 00:51:36.908
-Something impactful.
-Out of nowhere? Like a loser?

00:51:36.991 --> 00:51:39.994
Did you get her anything for the job?
That's a good reason.

00:51:40.077 --> 00:51:42.246
I already did.
I got her acupressure slippers.

00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:46.250
-Wow.
-Acu… Acupressure, my ass.

00:51:46.334 --> 00:51:48.002
Seriously, you're hopeless.

00:51:48.085 --> 00:51:50.880
This isn't going to work.
I'll talk to my dad.

00:51:50.963 --> 00:51:53.424
Get her an imported car or a sports car.

00:51:53.507 --> 00:51:55.676
Okay? I'll give you
a long installment plan.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.429
I won't attract her
with something expensive like him.

00:51:58.512 --> 00:52:00.097
Seriously. Damn it.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.515
Is that right?

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:02.516
For how many months?

00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:05.186
You little…

00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:06.103
Hurry up.

00:52:06.187 --> 00:52:08.397
You… wait. Okay, where's my phone?

00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:10.107
SEO JI-WOO

00:52:10.691 --> 00:52:11.525
Are you at work?

00:52:16.238 --> 00:52:19.909
You said you might work overtime,
so I thought you might still be at work.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.538
No, I'm on my way home.

00:52:27.124 --> 00:52:29.919
Okay. Have fun. Bye.

00:52:33.339 --> 00:52:34.215
Ms. Seo Ji-woo?

00:52:39.512 --> 00:52:42.390
I'm Jin Han-kyeong.
I work with Assistant Manager Lee.

00:52:43.099 --> 00:52:45.935
I've seen many pictures of you,
but we've never met in person.

00:52:48.062 --> 00:52:49.188
Hello.

00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:50.439
Assistant Manager Lee left.

00:52:50.523 --> 00:52:52.525
Yes. I just talked to him on the phone.

00:52:54.235 --> 00:52:55.069
Okay.

00:52:58.239 --> 00:53:00.491
If you don't mind, can we have some tea?

00:53:05.913 --> 00:53:08.916
I've been working with him
since we were in the Culture Team.

00:53:11.335 --> 00:53:13.295
Yes. I've heard.

00:53:13.838 --> 00:53:17.216
I've also heard that you go to
his mother's laundromat for her kimchi.

00:53:18.634 --> 00:53:19.719
That's right.

00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:37.445
With all due respect, let me say this.

00:53:41.532 --> 00:53:42.658
I'm actually

00:53:44.076 --> 00:53:45.202
a little disappointed.

00:53:46.328 --> 00:53:49.040
Assistant Manager Lee… No, Kyeong-do.

00:53:51.417 --> 00:53:55.046
Every time he makes a crucial decision
in his life, he is let down.

00:53:57.173 --> 00:53:58.215
It turns out

00:53:59.633 --> 00:54:01.218
you were the reason every time.

00:54:02.845 --> 00:54:07.224
In the past, when you got back together
and broke up again,

00:54:07.308 --> 00:54:10.311
he was waiting to be assigned
to the Current Affairs Team.

00:54:11.353 --> 00:54:15.733
He really wanted it, and I also think
it was more suitable for him.

00:54:16.984 --> 00:54:19.987
I don't know what happened exactly
between you two,

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.031
but Kyeong-do…

00:54:24.075 --> 00:54:27.161
Well, he was in so much pain.

00:54:28.287 --> 00:54:31.082
And as he was on leave,
the transfer was canceled.

00:54:34.043 --> 00:54:35.669
Let me overstep a little more.

00:54:36.879 --> 00:54:39.548
This time, it was a chance
to have training in Chicago.

00:54:39.632 --> 00:54:44.345
The competition rate was 100 to 1,
but he was rewarded for his big exclusive.

00:54:44.428 --> 00:54:47.515
And he turned it down
and gave the chance to another reporter.

00:54:58.818 --> 00:55:00.903
I know I'm overstepping my boundary,

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.446
but there's something

00:55:04.532 --> 00:55:06.575
you need to know, Ji-woo.

00:55:09.036 --> 00:55:12.790
Kyeong-do has always had
the highest priority.

00:55:27.388 --> 00:55:28.264
I'm sorry.

00:55:42.653 --> 00:55:43.529
Thank you.

00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:49.160
This is something I really needed to know.

00:55:55.416 --> 00:55:57.793
Thank you for telling me.

00:56:01.213 --> 00:56:02.715
Thank you…

00:56:04.884 --> 00:56:05.926
for your understanding.

00:56:18.022 --> 00:56:20.566
Does Jeong-min's father
import cars from abroad?

00:56:20.649 --> 00:56:21.483
Yes.

00:56:21.984 --> 00:56:25.988
I think he will later close
his used car shop and work for him.

00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:29.992
So? Is he getting you a lot of discounts?

00:56:31.577 --> 00:56:33.913
He said he'd get me
a long installment plan.

00:56:36.707 --> 00:56:41.170
You know what he said when I told him
that I got you acupressure slippers?

00:56:42.004 --> 00:56:43.422
He said I was hopeless.

00:56:50.095 --> 00:56:51.722
Are you busy at work?

00:56:57.645 --> 00:57:02.024
By the way, I returned the ring safely.

00:57:06.654 --> 00:57:08.364
You were right.

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.784
There's nothing good in seeing him again.

00:57:23.879 --> 00:57:25.089
You did the right thing.

00:57:25.756 --> 00:57:28.717
Was that a limited edition or something?
I'll get you one.

00:57:29.426 --> 00:57:30.469
Before I turn 80.

00:57:33.847 --> 00:57:34.848
Kyeong-do.

00:57:39.728 --> 00:57:40.980
Is something wrong?

00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:48.153
I can't ask you why you didn't go.

00:57:50.447 --> 00:57:53.492
I can't tell you
not to give up on good opportunities

00:57:54.785 --> 00:57:55.619
because of me.

00:58:05.045 --> 00:58:07.214
I'm dead happy that you're next to me.

00:58:08.048 --> 00:58:10.384
I feel like I'm finally living my life.

00:58:12.886 --> 00:58:13.971
So…

00:58:19.268 --> 00:58:20.185
I'm happy…

00:58:22.313 --> 00:58:24.398
that you're not…

00:58:30.738 --> 00:58:31.655
going to Chicago.

00:58:36.785 --> 00:58:37.953
Aren't I awful?

00:59:00.476 --> 00:59:01.727
I feel so relieved

00:59:03.437 --> 00:59:04.772
to hear that you're happy.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:14.448
Let's go.

00:59:31.423 --> 00:59:32.633
What's wrong with him?

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.650
Hey, Kyeong-do. Have you seen my car key?

00:59:50.275 --> 00:59:51.151
I don't know.

00:59:51.235 --> 00:59:54.279
What? Where did it go?

00:59:55.823 --> 00:59:57.324
Where the heck is it?

00:59:59.118 --> 01:00:00.160
Man, not here.

01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:02.538
But it's got to be here.

01:00:02.621 --> 01:00:03.831
Hey, come on. Let's go.

01:00:03.914 --> 01:00:05.666
No, wait. Where?

01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:06.792
Hurry. Come on.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.670
But why? Where are we going?
Where is the car key?

01:00:10.254 --> 01:00:12.798
It's way too early,
and I haven't even washed my face.

01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:16.593
Where are you taking me?
Tell me where we're going at least.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.028
Mr. Kim!

01:00:42.536 --> 01:00:46.874
Ji-woo, I want to get you imported cars
or limited edition luxury items,

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:49.501
but get them yourself.

01:00:50.419 --> 01:00:51.462
You're rich.

01:00:54.256 --> 01:00:58.969
But I'll find you a world
that you'll like.

01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:29.750
Ji-woo.

01:01:31.376 --> 01:01:32.211
Are you okay?

01:01:32.294 --> 01:01:33.420
The last bus has left.

01:01:33.504 --> 01:01:35.297
Oh, that's okay.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:39.468
Let's go, come on. Be careful. Let's go.

01:01:43.889 --> 01:01:44.932
There.

01:03:08.473 --> 01:03:09.891
The informant was Kang Min-woo.

01:03:10.726 --> 01:03:13.854
And you avoided me because you hated
the thought of me finding out?

01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:14.771
Don't accuse me.

01:03:14.855 --> 01:03:17.691
I didn't know that you, Seo Ji-woo,
and Cho Jin-eon were involved.

01:03:19.192 --> 01:03:23.030
Her mom had her from an affair.
Can you believe that?

01:03:23.113 --> 01:03:25.449
She needs our help,
so we should cooperate.

01:03:26.742 --> 01:03:31.455
Kyeong-do is right before my eyes.
I can't tell my heart not to fall for him.

01:03:31.538 --> 01:03:34.249
That's why couples elope at night.

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.751
Why do you need my passport?

01:03:36.335 --> 01:03:39.713
I guess Dad wanted to see
this side of you, Ji-woo.

01:03:39.796 --> 01:03:41.048
I can do it.

01:03:41.715 --> 01:03:42.966
Let's get into trouble.
