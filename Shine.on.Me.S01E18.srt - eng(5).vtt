You are back.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.080
Finally, I feel like a human again.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.820
It is absolutely freezing out there.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.000
What took you guys so long?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.020
Ask Jiang Rui.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.340
He insisted on taking me

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.660
to the shopping street for snacks.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.580
We even hit up two different spots.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.620
Hey, I was just trying
to keep you happy.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.300
What's all this for?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.820
We are hitting the slopes tomorrow too.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.380
Hu helped us rent some gear.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.040
Are these all skis?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.020
Perfect. Since I don't know how,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.920
I guess I'm off the hook
for teaching you.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.940
We've got Hu. Who needs you anyway?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.080
Exactly.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.620
Out of the four of you,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.660
three are total rookies,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.520
and one who's "okay-ish."

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.760
How's Hu

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.000
supposed to manage everyone?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.200
I think we should really

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.820
have Hu

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.940
find another instructor.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.900
Don't you worry
your little head about it.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.320
Stop being such a smart aleck.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.260
Go upstairs and hop in the shower.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.120
Get yourself warmed up.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.180
Let's go. I'm freezing my butt off.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.400
We're heading up.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.460
Why did you ask Zhuang Xu

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.440
to take photos for us?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.820
I didn't really think it through.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.920
I just figured, why should we be

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.040
the only ones freezing our hands off?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240
He should have to feel the chill too.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.300
I was just hoping

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.460
a handsome guy would
take a photo for us,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.240
and Mr. Zhuang happened
to be right there.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.160
Wait, since when did you change
how you address him?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.420
I just feel like

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.540
if you don't like someone,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.720
that's not a crime.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.340
But you can't just

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.079
keep leading them on one minute,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.320
and then acting all cold and distant
the next.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.140
It's totally messing with their head.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.240
So, it turns out,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.660
the feelings he showed

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.140
were just

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.060
a total misunderstanding.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.079
Right?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.160
Even I got the wrong idea again.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.720
It's not your fault.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.600
Wait, "again"?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.060
Slip of the tongue.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.200

Did I just shoot myself

in the foot?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.360

I didn't make the cut?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.560
Not really.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.740

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.320
9 AM.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.480

See you tomorrow.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.040
Is he really an instructor?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.840
Something just feels off.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.760
Like what?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.680
Since when are instructors this hot?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.880
I thought you were actually going
to say something important.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.980
Plus, he doesn't really have

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.800
that typical local accent.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.660
He doesn't sound like a local.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.320
Well, maybe he's from out of town,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.620
looking for a gig up here.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.340
Hey, how come this little snowman

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.420
looks exactly like you in that photo

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.900
I took for you?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.940
Well, isn't that just the look
around here?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.060
There's a pretty cool restaurant

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.400
up at the summit.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.080
We can grab a coffee over there

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.440
when we need a break,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.200
and just soak in the view for a bit.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.980
Great idea.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.260
You're back.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.160
You couldn't wait to dash out the second

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.880
we checked in, huh?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.180
So, what were you up to?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.500
Oh, just picked up a part-time gig.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.280
A gig?

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.920
Do tell.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.380
Ski instructing.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.540

on the snow.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.420
What's the hourly rate around here?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.260
Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Luo.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.340
I totally blanked on the pay.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.400
You really think
he's actually there to teach?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.980
So,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.960
you've already met her parents?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.740
No.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.060
That's why tomorrow,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:40.960
I'm showing up

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.320
as a ski instructor.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.520
I knew you were up to something

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.120
for this trip.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.300
I just didn't want to blow your cover.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.660
But the last thing I expected

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.180
was for you to be so lame.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.280
Alright, can I finally see

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.600
the photo of this girl?

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.320
Forget it.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.260
Maybe when I'm not so "lame."

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.500
Not gonna show me?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.860
But the slopes aren't that big.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.700
If we run into each other,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.680
I can't guarantee

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.480
how I'll react.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.820
Given my student's level,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.420
I'll mostly be sticking

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.160
to the blue runs.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.640
I won't bump into you pros

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.380
on the black runs.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.700
Alright.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.820
What's the rush?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.420
We'll meet her sooner or later anyway.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.520
Tell me about it.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.040
Nie Xiguang, hurry up.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.540
Hu and that instructor you hired

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.660
are already downstairs waiting.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.100
Coming!

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.120
They're here.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.840
It's so beautiful.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.800
Let me take that for you.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.580
Alright.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.520
Careful.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.260
I must have been
out of my mind yesterday

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.260
to actually let my mom

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.800
meet Lin Yusen just like that.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.080
Has everyone had breakfast yet?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.220
Yeah.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:28.840
Alright,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.560
we're heading to the slopes today.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.460
Since the three of you

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.680
don't have much experience,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.240
let's start at the beginner area

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:34.900
for some practice.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.540
And you guys hired an instructor,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.000
right?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.980
That's great.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.040
Good morning.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.000
It's safer with one instructor

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.780
for every two of you.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.040
We hired him?

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.320
Xiguang lined this guy up

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.540
last night, totally last-minute.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.120
I thought

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.140
she found him through Hu.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.880
Nope.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.740
She never asked me.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280
I...

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.880
found him online,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.360
on, uh, Weibo.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.800
Yeah, Weibo.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.980
Actually, I'm not from around here.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.640
I'm just visiting and picking up a gig.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.580
That's right.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.540
Time to roll.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:07.840
Okay.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.900
Let's get everyone in the minivan

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.060
and head to the ski center

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.880
to drop our bags off.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.360
Thanks.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.240
Here, let me take that.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.060
It's okay.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.680
Thanks.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.380
Take it easy, Aunt.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.080
Xiguang,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.380
where on earth did you find

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.440
such a handsome instructor?

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.340
On Weibo.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.740
I knew that.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.480
Did he post photos?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.040
I mean, how else would you have
picked him out?

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.380
Does a hottie like him

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.320
charge extra per hour?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.920
Do you really need
to know every little detail?

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.960
He only posted a side profile.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.820
Show me his Weibo.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:11.880
Aunt,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.760
Uncle is giving you the death stare.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.120
I just want to know

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.720
if our new instructor

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.340
is staying with us all day

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.860
and what his rate is.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.240
I already settled it with Nie online.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.660
You only pay if you find
my instructing up to par.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.520
Otherwise, it's on me.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.460
Xiguang,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.980
you are such a shark.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.080
What if my mom and the guys

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.920
are just hopeless?

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.960
You can't pin that on the instructor.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.500
I...

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.660
I mean,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.280
I did say that.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.860
It is a bit much, isn't it?

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.360
But I...

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.500
That hustler streak
has nothing to do with me.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.720
I never taught her to be like that.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.160
We can't do that.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.620
We should still pay by the hour.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.260
Let's just stick to Hu's rate.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.140
Oh, right.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.180
Sir,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.700
how should we address you?

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.240
Ma'am,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.760
you can just call me Lin.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:14.940
Lin.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.860
Got it.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.320
Okay,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.660
let's start

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.160
with the basics.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.580
Since

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.340
it's your first time,

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.760
I'll take the lead.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.300
Sounds good.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.360
Nie already knows how to ski,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.540
so she'll pair up with Mr. Lin.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.560
No problem.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.980
Lin,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.480
you're not teaching us?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.640
We could swap.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.480
No way.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.060
He's an online hire.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.660
I'm worried he's too green for this.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.320
I think it's okay.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.080
She's right.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.400
Hu is fine

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.960
for us.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.860
Come on.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.540
Alright.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.760
Let's begin.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.480
First,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.160
we'll learn

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.120
how to strap into these boards.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.340
See

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.280
this binding

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.540
here?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.900
What's with you?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.080
"We could swap"?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.220
If I'm looking to level up
our relationship,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.660
I've got to play nice

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.700
with your family.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.740
I have an idea.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.380
Why don't you say

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.520
you have an emergency

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.100
in an hour

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:50.880
and vanish

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.340
into the snow forever?

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.020
What, am I getting buried alive?

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.680
Of course not.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.820
I mean, I could.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.440
I'm not getting paid anyway.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.780
But your mom just said

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.260
she'd pay me by the hour.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.400
Now I'm not so sure I want to leave.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.660
Nie, let's get started.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:12.579
Take a run

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.819
so I can see your form.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.160
♪The second you got close♪

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.360
♪Even the breeze felt sweet♪

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.520
♪I acted like I didn't care♪

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.460
♪But you saw right through me♪

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.340
♪The coffee's getting cold♪

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.180
Were your calves a bit sore

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.500
when you woke up this morning?

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.360
How did you know?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.140
You need to adjust your form.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.800
You're driving from your calves.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.980
Plus, you're leaning back too much.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.800
♪Yet I'm just lost in the way you smile♪

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.640
You're right.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.220
I think I am.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.480
I'm a bit scared of falling.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.200
So I end up leaning back unconsciously.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.580
♪I wonder if the feeling
lingers for you too♪

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.740
Say cheese!

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.400
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.700
Finger heart!

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.980
Make a heart like this.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.720
♪Yet I'm still waiting, on and on♪

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.240
Look at that pose.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.780
Like they just conquered the Himalayas.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.660
♪You've been on my mind all day♪

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.100
♪Just a little closer to you♪

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.160
♪Before every goodnight♪

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.140
Looks like I'm not needed here,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.680
huh?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.620
Fine, I'll just go

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840
ski alone.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.840
Just go.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.680
Bye.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.280
Choosing a hot guy over your own cousin?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.000
I'm hot too, you know.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.120
Honestly.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.800
Be careful.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.100
Let's go.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.600
♪The coffee's getting cold♪

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.680
♪My heartbeat becomes
impossible to ignore♪

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.940
♪You said you loved summer♪

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.540
♪Yet I'm just lost in the way you smile♪

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.400
♪You've been on my mind all day♪

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.840
♪Just a little closer to you♪

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.900
♪Before every goodnight♪

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.280
♪I whisper your name again and again♪

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.680
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.940
It feels like flying on a sword.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.680
Let's try the green runs then.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.500
Maybe I should do a few more runs here.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.200
I don't want to be a human torpedo.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.180
It's been forever
since I hit the green runs.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.560
I'm super rusty now.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.760
And I remember

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.880
that I always wipe out

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.180
getting off the lift.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.620
I haven't tried the green runs here yet.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.000
I'll go check the pitch and the snow.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.640
You take a break here

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.540
for a bit.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:00.940
Okay.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.040
Be careful.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.080
Hu, come over here.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.920
Easy now.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.200
Slow down.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.440
This is the last day

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.120
I'm babysitting you guys.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.220
Tomorrow, you're on your own.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.380
Don't! We're lost without you.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.760
Zhuang Xu,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.760
your student's cousin is up there.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.360
The girl who took

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.200
our photos yesterday.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.460
She's a real cutie.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.680
Why is she alone?

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.800
Should we invite her to join us?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.960
Give it up.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.100
She's taken.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.200
Right, Zhuang Xu?

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.500
Yeah.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.640
You okay?

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.420
So much for not being a torpedo, huh?

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.980
I didn't do any damage, did I?

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.500
Crashing into me is one thing,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.460
but why the personal attack?

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.080
With your mass and that velocity,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.800
you're not strong enough to dent me.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.320
What a weird flex.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.300
So, how was it?

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.740
Is the green run steep?

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:40.900
It's pretty mellow.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.260
You can totally handle it.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.020
Let's go.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.400
See?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.200
She's got her boyfriend with her.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.340
And he's hot.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.740
Hey, you make it sound

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.820
like I have ulterior motives.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.120
But

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.460
I don't think they look like a couple.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.900
Look at other couples.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.180
They're all hand-in-hand,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.920
like they're literally

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.520
attached at the hip.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.140
How so?

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.320
Ask Zhuang Xu.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.100
Do couples have to

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160
be so lovey-dovey?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.500
I don't know.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.220
That catch just now

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.520
was so romantic.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.340
It's like a scene

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.680
straight out of my dreams.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.740
Too bad

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.160
for now, I'm the only one

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280
here to catch you.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.480
Let's move.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.860
We're heading to the green runs too.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.500
Let's go.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.600
I'm heading to the blue runs.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.020
Lean your weight forward.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.420
Just glide forward naturally.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.320
Don't be afraid.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.860
I'll be right here watching you.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.860
Wait!

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.340
See?

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.500
Told you I'd wipe out.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.940
You'll get it with a bit more practice.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.180
I can't let him

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.660
catch me every time.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:51.940
Don't be scared.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.400
It's no different from the magic carpet.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.400
Just think of it as "flying on a sword"

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.300
for just a little longer.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.140
I'll be right by your side.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.580
Go.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.840

Stop filming me.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.300
Jiang Rui says I look like

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.780
a scuttling crab.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.890
♪I just wanna give my time♪

What's so funny?

It's only natural.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.700
After all,

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.880
you're both from Jiangsu.
[*Jiangsu is famous for its crabs.]

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.850
♪You chasing waterfalls♪

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.110

♪Oh you girl, you have it all♪

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.440
See them anywhere?

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.180
We've been on the blue runs

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.180
for ages.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.680
Did you spot Yusen?

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.540
Nope.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060
That brat definitely

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.860
played us.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.040
Should we

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.700
look for them somewhere else?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.040
Forget it.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.660
I'll settle the score with him tonight.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.540
Weiai?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.000
I was on fire today.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.900
I'm back

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.740
to my old self.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.400
Too bad no one was there

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.300
to capture my best moves.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:44.640
Lin,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.920
did you take any photos of Xiguang?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.420
I did,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.780
but she took my phone and deleted them.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.980
Xiguang, are you that bossy?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.940
Just eat your meat

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.460
and mind your own business.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.040
I'm totally wiped out today.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.400
No more skiing for me tomorrow.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.980
Anyway, I've got the photos.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.280
Are you guys still going tomorrow?

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.320
Of course.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.400
Just don't drag me

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.240
to see those tourist sights again.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.020
Did I ask you?

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.560
We're not going.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.460
Let's do something more relaxing.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.640
Then tomorrow,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.000
let's see if Tianchi Lake is open.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.360
If it is, we'll head over there.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.820
Otherwise, we'll just wander
around Yanji.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.700
Okay.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:17.960
Sounds like a plan.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.380
Alright.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:18.820
Jiang Rui,

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.960
tomorrow, you and Xiguang

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.640
can go do your skiing.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.600
We'll stick to our plan.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.340
Hu will come with us,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.540
and Lin, you stay with them.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.800
We'll just split up.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.320
It works out

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.220
better this way.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.120
Oh, by the way,

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.540
Lin, you mentioned this morning

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.880
that you're just here on vacation too?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.440
That's right.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.880
Where are you from?

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.060
I'm from Shanghai.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.600
Shanghai?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.220
That's really close to us.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.180
We're from Nanjing and Wuxi.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.400
What a coincidence.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.320
I'm working in Suzhou.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.120
Xiguang is in Suzhou too.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.760
What are the odds?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.080
So

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.700
what do you do?

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.440
Aunt,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.380
have some meat.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.640
It's way better

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.840
than the Northeast restaurants
back home.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.520
Give it a try.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.880
Okay.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.480
This juice is great.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.680
Here, have some.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.740
It's got real fruit pulp in it.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.080
Stop prying

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.180
into his life.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.320
It's not like
you're conducting a background check.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.340
Stewed Goose in Iron Pot!

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380
It's ready. Enjoy your meal.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.040
OK.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.520
Thanks.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.260
Okay.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.480
Weiai,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.380
check out that slide.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.720
Go give it a try.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.620
No,

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.960
I'm way too old for that.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.080
What's age got to do with it?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.120
That ice sculpture is great.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.120
Let me take a photo of you.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.380
Right here?

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.240
We need some proof we were here.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:47.560
Go.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.580
Strike a pose.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.140
How's this?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540
That's it. Perfect.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.500
One, two, three.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.740
Switch it up.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:00.900
One...

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.780
Luo,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.620
see that person over there?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.220
Well, well, look who we have here.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.560
That little brat.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.520
Finally caught you red-handed.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.380
Take it easy.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.800
Eat up, everyone.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.840
Green beans from anywhere else

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.580
just don't have this texture.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.900
They're really not as tender
and starchy.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.200
Here, have some more.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.580
Alright.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.200
This is delicious.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.040
Mr. Lin?

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.380
It really is you!

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.380
What are you doing here?

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.420
Didn't you say you were
leaving Changbai Mountain

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.960
and couldn't be my instructor anymore?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.580
Don't tell me

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.860
you took another gig instead?

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.600
Lin Yusen isn't even a real instructor.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.080
There's no way he'd take another gig.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.540
Could this Madam...

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.080
be...?

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.860
Mr. Lin,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.820
you have some explaining to do.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.500
Are you getting a better offer

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.620
from someone else?

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.800
Mom.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:11.940
Mr. Luo.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.720
I can't help you out.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.160
Your mom spent forever

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.160
looking for you on the blue runs.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.760
Lin,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.720
who are they?

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.620
Everyone,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.120
this is my mom and Mr. Luo.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.500
She's just joking around.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.440
Okay.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:28.960
I see.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.940
Mom, Mr. Luo,

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.580
this is my colleague, Xiguang,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.280
her mom,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.020
and her uncle's family.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.580
And this is their guide, Hu.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.260
Hello.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.560
Nice to meet you all.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.160
- Colleague?
- Colleague?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.120
Xiguang, you lied to me?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.340
You just sold me out

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.420
right to my face?

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.580
My family and I

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.920
are just here for the holidays too.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.420
I bumped into Xiguang,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.660
and just for fun,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.940
I played a little prank.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.960
Sorry about that.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.060
It's fine.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.520
You young folks always have your tricks.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.920
Yusen,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.020
take your time with the meal.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.100
We'll leave you to it.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.740
Ms. Sheng.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.820
You're...

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.820
Jiang...

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.660
Jiang Yun.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.800
Are you going to tell us yourself,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.860
or do we have to ask?

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.120
What?

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.800
He's my boss

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.540
and he happened to come
to Changbai Mountain for a trip,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.700
and we just made a joke.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.280
We already talked about it

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.600
at dinner.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:22.960
He's the boss

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.660
you mentioned?

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.840
You knew that?

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.320
No, I don't.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.040
Xiguang,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.420
answer me.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.520
Is he

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.840
chasing after you?

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.280
- Great! I agree...
- Mom.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.500
How can you say that?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.000
You were just telling us

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.700
to be more careful in relationships

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.620
and to take things slow.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.900
Now you've changed your tune.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:01.900
Well, I just think

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.240
he's quite a catch.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.960
He's

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.920
the total package

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.120
and very easygoing.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.360
It's just his family

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.240
is a lot to deal with.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.980
How so?

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.520
Isn't he just Sheng Xianmin's grandson?

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.980
It's not that simple.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:20.800
Xiguang,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.340
how much do you know about his family?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.520
I only know

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.340
that his dad passed away long ago,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.000
and his mom has lived abroad for years.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.340
Beyond that, I'm in the dark.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.380
You met Lin's dad before, didn't you?

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.440
Yes,

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.820
many years ago

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.680
at a business gala

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.520
in Shanghai.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:42.880
Back then,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.880
Xiguang's dad and I
were just starting our business.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.080
We had to pull some strings
just to get in.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.920
Someone introduced us

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.080
to Ms. Sheng and Mr. Lin.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.380
We didn't stay in touch much after that.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.100
A few years later,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.180
I heard that something happened
to Mr. Lin.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.980
How come you've never mentioned this?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.960
What exactly happened to Lin's dad?

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.700
That's a long story.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.480
Normally,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.900
I wouldn't gossip

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.040
about others' families.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.639
But if Xiguang is seriously considering

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:13.840
a relationship with him,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.699
there are some things she ought to know.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.760
You all met

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.739
Ms. Sheng today.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.580
She has a very unique name,

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.139
Sheng Weiai.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.460
Just from her name,

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.219
you can tell

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:25.940
she was once

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.820
the apple

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.780
of everyone's eye.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.639
The first time I met
Jiang Yun and her husband

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.980
was at a gala.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.739
I went with your dad.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.020
They were

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.659
just starting out back then,

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.040
but they really stood out

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:44.179
in the crowd.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.080
Nie Chengyuan.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.159
That was his name, right?

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.639
Yeah.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.080
He was

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.179
a striking man, sure.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.179
But

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.300
he was overly eager
and a total blowhard.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.160
I wasn't exactly impressed.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.340
Jiang Yun, on the other hand,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.880
had the calm and composed air,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.420
perfectly poised.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.820
I couldn't help

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.940
but like her instantly.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.340
But later,

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.740
Nie became close with your uncle, Bokai,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.420
so naturally,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.520
we drifted apart.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.980
Who would've thought

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.580
that after all these years,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.780
we'd be connected like this again.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.460
Xiguang made

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.880
a great first impression on me.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.560
Her eyes are so clear
and full of spirit.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.640
Don't let her slip away.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.940
It's just

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.140
that Nie has deep ties

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.020
with Bokai,

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.360
I wonder if there will be some pushback.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.380
Ms. Jiang and Mr. Nie are divorced.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.180
So there's no need to worry about that.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.800
Sharing the struggle is natural,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.320
but sharing the success
takes real effort.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.020
That's nothing new.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.840
There's something I need to tell you.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.020
Mr. Luo and I went

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.300
to the blue runs today,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.160
hoping to run into you.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.240
But instead,

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.640
we ended up bumping into

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.340
some of your aunt's relatives.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.460
It won't be long before your grandpa

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.240
finds out

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.140
I'm back.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.540
He'll likely ask you something.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.920
I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.740
I understand.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.980
What did you tell him

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.120
before Chinese New Year?

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.980
He never asks much

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.160
before the holiday.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.460
It's only afterwards that he'll check in

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.080
to see if everything is alright.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.560
I tell him it is,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.280
and he leaves it at that.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.040
After the holiday,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.980
it'll be time
for his birthday banquet again, right?

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.360
Yes.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.340
It looks like they're planning
a grand celebration this year.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.520
Do you think I'm heartless

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.040
for not visiting my own dad

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.000
all these years?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.620
Of course not.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.820
I told you that when I was a child.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.900
Thank you, Yusen.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.000
Sorry you had to grow up so fast.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.940
You're finally settling
into a relationship.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.340
If all goes well,

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.520
soon enough,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.720
you'll have a family of your own.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.400
I can finally set down

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.000
this weight in my heart.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.680
I'm doing just fine on my own.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.220
You don't need to worry about me.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.100
That's not the same thing.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.200
Can't you feel it?

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.120
When you

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.960
have someone you love

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.920
by your side,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.100
the whole world feels full of hope,

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.580
as if everything is brand new.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.380
I don't think

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.060
I've ever told you

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:40.840
the story of your dad and me,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.160
when we were young.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.520
Want to hear it?

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.880
Of course.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.040
Back then,

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.180
it was me

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.480
who pursued your dad.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.900
I know.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.780
How could you know?

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.340
I think, when I was very little,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.840
Dad told me in secret.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.200
I still kind of remember it.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.120
He told you that?

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.200
Then he definitely didn't tell you

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.400
that at first,

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.920
he turned me down

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.920
again and again.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.300
I was almost ready to give up.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.640
But one day, it was pouring rain

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.560
and I tripped.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.680
The rain was so heavy

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:30.900
that I couldn't see

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.980
anyone a few meters ahead.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.620
But he was

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.820
about thirty meters out

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.900
and he just rushed over to me.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.820
That was the moment I knew
I could never let him go.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.660
I confronted him:

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.260
"You like me,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.360
so why do you keep shutting me out?"

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.740
He gave me

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.820
a cliché reason,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.360
that he felt
he wasn't good enough for me.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.060
Of course,

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.980
I couldn't accept that.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.940
I was so confident back then,

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.940
believing that as long as
we loved each other,

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.720
nothing else mattered.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.440
And things did go smoothly

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.020
for a while.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.420
We fell in love,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.660
got married,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.460
and had you.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.540
To prove himself,

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.960
your dad worked tirelessly,
day and night.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.180
But because he was too brilliant,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.420
he stirred up jealousy in others.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.840
In the end, they conspired against him

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.500
and set him up to make a mistake.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.360
Your grandpa knew perfectly well
he was innocent,

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.200
yet he still

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.660
exiled him

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.840
to a place so far away.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.100
I always remember

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.920
what your dad told me before he left.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.040
He told me not to be angry
with your grandpa,

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.460
that he had his reasons.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.360
Your grandpa told me

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.960
it was only temporary,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.220
just to quiet the critics,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.320
and that he'd send him
back within a year.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.360
But that one year

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.520
became three.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.440
And in the end...

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.760
What could matter more

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.440
than your dad's life?

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.160
It was simply because your dad

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.660
was so capable and selfless

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.960
that he made your uncles'

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.160
greed and incompetence look even worse.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.160
I blame them,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.340
but I blame myself even more.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.460
I insisted

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.780
on being with him.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.520
I brought him to Shengyuan.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.680
He could have had

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.460
a wonderful life.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.320
He was always so healthy,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.280
with a perfect medical record.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.640
He should have lived a long life.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.520
I changed his fate,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.640
but I failed to protect him.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.600
And so, at such a young age,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.860
he met his end far from home,

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.340
utterly alone.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.640
But

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.880
they are all my family.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.480
What could I do?

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.080
All I could do was punish myself.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.860
I can't just act

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.220
like nothing happened.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.660
I can't pretend
to be the "good daughter"

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.680
or the "good sister,"

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.600
acting like everything's fine,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.180
or that I actually feel
that "family warmth,"

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.700
while your grandparents,

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.680
already in their sixties,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.940
faced the most devastating tragedy,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.060
having to bury their own child.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.440
Mom,

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800
you shouldn't carry

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.800
all this guilt on your own.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.240
At least Grandma and Grandpa

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.620
never once blamed you.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.780
I know.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.260
That's why, back then,

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.900
I just wanted to run away from it all

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.680
and take you with me,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.200
but in the end,

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.560
I left you with them.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.400
I let you down, too.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.200
I wasn't strong enough
to hold us together.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.100
That's not true.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.700
You called me every single day.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.360
Honestly, it was getting a bit much.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.900
And all those summer
and winter breaks you spent

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.660
with me in Switzerland
were annoying too?

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.320
No.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.100
Those trips

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.120
were what kept me studying hard.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.320
I only wished that you'd never have to

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.140
find out about any of those things.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.120
That's why I never stopped you

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.620
from seeing my dad

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.920
when you were little.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.640
Now that I think about it,

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.980
was I wrong again?

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.380
You found out anyway.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.820
You must have suffered

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.900
so much.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.120
Grandma and Grandpa
never said a word either,

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.560
not even when they passed away.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.180
You all just wanted me

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.520
to grow up without hatred

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.860
and have a childhood that felt whole.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.460
Thank you, Yusen.
