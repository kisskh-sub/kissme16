Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.781
Please check the stock of black coins.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.117
None remains.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.460
I'll see you later, then.

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:49.800
Black coins are all out.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.552
Black coins are out?

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.389
So he had none left? That's a huge blow.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.559
Until then, we were certain
we were ahead of STEM Division.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.853
It was an unexpected turn of events.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:04.565
Our division used multiple coins
to make the queries

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.984
but failed to bring in any profits.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.280
DESPITE USING 5 GOLD COINS

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.198
None remains.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.534
MEDICAL DIVISION FAILED TO BUY BLACK COINS

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.453
I was really flustered.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.582
- We have one visit left to the Exchange.
- Should we get anything?

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.792
- What should we get?
- Something cheap?

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.754
We could also buy the coins
that will do well in Round 4 or 5.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:30.757
Did STEM Division buy anything in Round 2?

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.803
- They did get something.
- Did they go to the Exchange?

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:35.887
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:40.017
30 MINUTES AGO

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.435
That's our plan for Round 1.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.186
- We can fine-tune it later.
- Let's get in line.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.396
I'll go first.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.607
AS SOON AS ROUND 1 BEGAN,
MEDICAL DIVISION ASKED QUESTIONS

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.735
Medical Division just sent people
into the Inquiry Booth.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.778
They probably have a similar plan.

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:55.365
- They're ahead of us.
- They'd be asking about Round 2.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.283
Why don't we ask

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.703
about the coin with the biggest price gain
from Round 1 to 3?

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.996
TARGETS ROUND 3'S HIGHEST EARNING COIN

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:04.207
We knew Medical Division
would've thought of binary search.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.335
Since they were using the same approach,

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.754
they could get ahead of us
and buy the coin we wanted.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.922
Then, we would've wasted our queries.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.341
From Round 1 to 3?

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.009
JUMPS AHEAD TO FIND
ROUND 3'S BEST PERFORMER

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.269
It's the black coin.

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:27.564
BLACK COIN HAS THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 1 TO 3

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:30.275
Black coins. Two teams get 8,
and the other gets 9.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:33.487
I'd like to buy eight black coins.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.280
Eight black coins, please.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.865
Nine black coins, please.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.951
8 COINS, 8 COINS, 9 COINS

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.663
Once they learn black coin
gains the most in Round 3,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:43.872
they'll be so shaken.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.290
Totally.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.210
Losing all of black coins to them
is a huge blow.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.336
For now...

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.131
I mean, Round 3 is important
because of the asset reveal.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.342
It won't hurt to change our strategy.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.802
STRATEGY REVISION REQUIRED

00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:01.306
We could check our coin's price
and sell them if it drops.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.183
- The pink coins?
- The price may go up again.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.148
I think he's eavesdropping over there.

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.817
Let's lower our voices.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.569
He's going in
after listening in on our conversation.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.530
We'll have to submit the query soon.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.948
He heard everything.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.408
KANG JI-HOO LIT A FIRE
UNDER MEDICAL DIVISION

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.036
EVER SINCE CHOI A-IN WALKED
OUT OF THE EXCHANGE

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.746
KANG JI-HOO HAS BEEN OBSERVING

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.957
As they say,
too many cooks spoil the broth.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.169
Frankly, our strategy wouldn't change much
with or without me.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.713
We already had our plan.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.509
So I thought about what more I could do
to contribute to my division.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.303
Are we sure
they bought anything in Round 1?

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.972
We don't know that.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.932
We missed that completely.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.602
We hadn't been keeping an eye
on what our opponents were doing.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.147
We needed to know what they were doing

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.692
to hatch a plan to turn the tables on them
and secure a victory.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.112
I think we need a scout to monitor them.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.407
That's a good idea.
That way, we can see their general plan.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.286
KANG JI-HOO COUNTED
MEDICAL DIVISION'S VISITS TO THE EXCHANGE

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.415
I don't think
they're buying anything this round.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.332
What?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.959
Why aren't they buying, though?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.044
Maybe I'm getting my hopes up too much,

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.381
but they might have failed to buy
the black coins.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.384
They must've learned
all black coins were out.

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.387
I think that kind of messed up their game.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:26.892
...close in one minute.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.314
It's going up.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.982
Up? The price is going up.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.567
- Up?
- Let's hold on to them.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.195
- The price will go up.
- Then, we should keep them.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.780
DECIDED TO KEEP THE PINK COINS

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:43.241
I think we should redefine our goals
at this stage.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.619
Why don't we talk it over
in the Division Room?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.082
Our strategy so far has been figuring out

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:55.003
the coin with the biggest price gain
from this round to the next one

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.339
and purchase all of them.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.258
But since our opponents
cleaned out the coin

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.719
that will do well in the next round...

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.472
Are we not using binary search anymore
to find the best performer?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.893
We still need to find the best performer,
but we must consider Ji-hoo's motive.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.813
We need to assume he was out there
because his division figured out

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.773
- the best performer in Round 4.
- Right.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.734
I suggest we buy the coin
that will do well in Round 5.

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.904
Should we ask about the price gain
from Round 3 to 5

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.739
- considering our goal?
- Of course.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.617
That's right.
Let's increase our assets in Round 5.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.870
The problem is, we're not sure
how much STEM Division knows.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.915
I bet Medical Division is floundering.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:36.086
I mean, we're out here
already in position for the next round.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.463
20 MINUTES AGO
Should we check the price gain...

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.924
- From Round 3 to 4?
- Yes, we should.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.134
DECIDED TO BUY THE COIN
WITH THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN IN ROUND 4

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.391
It's either silver or black.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.892
- It's silver, then.
- Yes.

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.728
The moment Round 3 begins,
we'll sell our black coins...

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.273
- Right, then we'll buy silver coins.
- Oh, okay.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.859
Round 2 ends in 5 minutes.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.277
I'll go reserve our place.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.154
STEM DIVISION PLANS TO BUY
ROUND 4'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.283
I think we're going to win
if our miners do well.

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.912
Our strategy
for the earlier rounds worked.

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.873
It's time to plan for the middle rounds.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.041
We need to nail the final rounds to win.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:19.462
A miner in Team SNU in STEM
requested a change of position.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.132
- Want to try?
- Sure.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.174
See you later.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.677
We're selling black coins
and buying silver coins, okay?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.429
- Get eight silver coins.
- Okay.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.224
Did you handle multiplication?

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.518
We switched
because I kept making mistakes.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.981
That concludes Round 2.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.318
Coin prices in Round 3
will now be revealed.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.987
STEM DIVISION OWNS 25 BLACK COINS

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.656
Black coin, 16,000 won.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.912
- It increased so much.
- Wait, the black coins...

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.247
Pink coin, 14,000 won.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.461
I'd say it's legendary.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:04.049
Fortunately, it looks like we did better.
Black coin had the highest spike.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:07.218
- Pink coin had a 1,000-won gain.
- Black coin's price shot up.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.346
Are we falling behind by 50,000 won?

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.263
ACCUMULATED RETURNS

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.724
MEDICAL DIVISION: 100,000 WON
STEM DIVISION: 150,000 WON

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.226
We should find out
which coin will rise in Round 5.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.103
Should we do the binary search
for Round 5?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.271
All right.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:23.902
MEDICAL DIVISION WANTS TO SECURE
THE BEST PERFORMING COIN OF ROUND 5 FIRST

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.696
AS PLANNED, STEM DIVISION BUYS
THE BEST PERFORMING COIN OF ROUND 4

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.115
YOU CAN CHECK THE STOCK OF ONE COIN
BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.617
Do you have any pink coins left?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.786
No, none remains.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.830
I'll sell my coins first.
Here are eight black coins.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.750
Here's 128,000 won.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.586
And I'd like to buy nine silver coins.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.256
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min,
here are nine silver coins.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.508
Thank you.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.095
- They're still holding onto pink.
- Really?

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.846
- They are all out.
- They are?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:57.352
STEM DIVISION OBTAINS PROFIT
FROM SELLING THEIR BLACK COINS

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.646
THEY THEN PURCHASED 8 SILVER COINS EACH

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.689
Thank you.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.944
It bugs me that STEM Division
earned a lot with the black coin.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.029
- How many did we get?
- Three.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.991
That's not bad.
Maybe the miners will determine the game.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:15.537
The amount
we're falling behind in investment

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.871
- is 50,000 won.
- Right.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.873
We had 20,000 won at the outset,

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:22.460
so if our division can mine
one more gold coin than our opponents,

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.420
we're even.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.130
Aren't our guys better at calculation?

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:29.092
Team Yonsei succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.344
You're so thorough.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.388
How much have they earned so far?

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.558
Team POSTECH succeeded...

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.227
Team SKKU succeeded...

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:43.023
Team KAIST succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.651
- TEAM KAIST is on fire.
- Totally.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.862
Our miners are catching up.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.990
- They're checking the price gain, right?
- That's right.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.075
- From Round 3 to 5, right?
- Yes.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.787
MEDICAL DIVISION WANTS TO SECURE
ROUND 5'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.208
We shouldn't overlook the fact

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.794
that they made more profit
than we did in Round 4.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.631
I asked, "Is the coin
with the biggest positive price gain

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.675
from Round 3 to 5
between black, pink, silver, and red?"

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.760
The answer was no.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.470
THE BEST PERFORMER
ISN'T BLACK, PINK, SILVER, OR RED

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.765
We can cross them out.
We should ask about the remaining ones.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.267
- About the three remaining ones?
- Yes.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.728
IS THE COIN
WITH THE BIGGEST POSITIVE PRICE GAIN

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.980
FROM ROUND 3 TO 5 BETWEEN GREEN AND BLUE?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.900
The answer's no.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.234
You got no?

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.362
- If the answer is no...
- I got a no.

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.615
Only the purple coin remains.

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.202
But there's a chance
the gain is a negative number.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.369
EVEN PURPLE COIN'S PRICE MAY GO DOWN

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.080
Are we getting a bear market?

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.999
Maybe the market's going to crash.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.711
Let's include another coin in the query
and ask if the gain exceeds zero.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.004
Let's ask right away.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.716
IF IT EXCEEDS 0, THE PRICE GOES UP
IF IT DOESN'T, THE PRICE GOES DOWN

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.886
If it exceeds zero, let's buy them all
and sell our pink coins.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.685
Can you wait by the Exchange?

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.230
- I'm feeling anxious.
- Okay.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.315
Let's go line up by the Exchange.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.949
Team SNU in STEM succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.284
I think purple gets negative growth.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.037
I asked if purple or green has
a positive price gain from Round 3 to 5,

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.833
- and the answer was no.
- Round 5 is a bear market.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.338
- Are they buying now?
- They're not doing anything.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:34.384
It looks like they believe
pink coin's price will go up, doesn't it?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.886
We'll sell pink coins in Round 4.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.681
- We must.
- In Round 4, we shouldn't have anything.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.851
- In Round 4, everything should be...
- We should cash in.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.310
Because it's a bear market.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.353
LIQUIDATION PLANNED

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.314
That concludes Round 3 of Mine and Trade.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.443
Bear in mind that they may have a lead
from acquiring all black coins.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.989
Each division's total assets
will now be revealed.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.907
- I'm getting nervous.
- Shall we use the big screen?

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.702
The big screen sounds nice.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.204
Please...

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.086
Medical Division has 790,000 won.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.379
STEM Division

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.217
has 740,000 won.

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.303
- ...has 740,000 won.
- What?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.764
MEDICAL DIVISION: 790,000 WON
STEM DIVISION: 740,000 WON

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:25.351
Did they sell the black coins

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.271
- and make a bad investment?
- Maybe they lost some money that way.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.898
Maybe our miners did better.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.859
I don't get why we're falling behind.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.778
STEM Division has 740,000 won.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:36.863
MINING ROOM

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.156
Did you hear that?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.117
- How big is the difference?
- It's 50,000 won.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.161
- We're behind by 50,000 won?
- Yeah.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.663
Let's crank up the mining efforts.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.832
The difference is 50,000 won.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.963
Good job, guys.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.049
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 14
TEAM KAIST: 11, TEAM POSTECH: 15

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.342
STEM DIVISION'S TOTAL: 40 COINS

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.764
Why is the difference so small?

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.017
- How are you holding up?
- I'm doing fine.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.769
I misread the number. That's all.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.815
Do you want to switch? Are you okay?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.567
- I'm good.
- Okay.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.611
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 20
TEAM YONSEI: 20, TEAM SKKU: 16

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:17.946
MEDICAL DIVISION'S TOTAL: 53 COINS

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.783
MEDICAL DIVISION MINED 13 MORE COINS

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.451
CURRENT 1ST PLACE IN MINING

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.537
FRONT-RUNNERS: TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU
AND TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE, JOO MIN-SEO

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.208
OVERALL 1ST PLACE: JOO MIN-SEO, 13 COINS

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.253
10-DIGIT-BY-10-DIGIT MULTIPLICATION

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.047
A TOTAL OF 13 QUESTIONS SOLVED,
EACH TAKING 5.7 MINUTES

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.800
Working with the 10-digit numbers
was a complex process,

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.678
so I tried my best
not to make a mistake along the way.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.222
I was also surprised
that I made no mistakes.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:47.642
I couldn't be sure if I was slow
or Min-seo was insanely quick.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.478
Turns out she was that quick.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.231
OVERALL 2ND PLACE: KANG JI-HU, 12 COINS

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.442
Coin prices in Round 4
will now be revealed.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.779
STEM DIVISION HOLDS SILVER COINS
MEDICAL DIVISION HOLDS PINK COINS

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.030
We gained 1,000 won.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.701
- It's still a gain.
- Baby steps, right?

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:09.914
Let's keep the door open
to monitor the trading activities.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.667
I'll go make our trade.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.669
Let's go sell the silver coins.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.463
I'll ask about the pink coin's stock.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.178
KIM GANG-HYEON AND JAE SEUNG-GYU
LINE UP BY THE EXCHANGE

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.727
Two STEM teams lined up to make a trade.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.396
They must know
all the prices are going to drop.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.772
I doubt they'll buy anything.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.649
- The answer was no.
- What?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.776
We're getting a bear market.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.279
- A bear market?
- Neither red nor silver will see profit.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.780
Shall we cash in and wait?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.532
- Let's sell everything.
- Okay.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.616
LIQUIDATION DECIDED

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.077
I'd like to check the pink coin's stock.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.412
None remains.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.956
I'd like to sell nine silver coins.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.917
- He has no pink coins.
- That means

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.919
it's safe to say we're in the lead, right?

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.671
We had a 3,000-won price gain.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.091
When we cash in all 25 silver coins,
our profit totals 75,000 won.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.801
MEDICAL DIVISION: 790,000 WON
PINK COIN'S PROFIT: 25,000 WON

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.470
STEM DIVISION: 740,000 WON
SILVER COIN'S PROFIT: 75,000 WON

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.973
STEM DIVISION CAUGHT UP
ON MEDICAL DIVISION WITH EARNINGS

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.769
STEM DIVISION LIQUIDATED ALL THEIR ASSETS
I'd like to sell eight silver coins.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.979
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded in mining.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.315
Team Yonsei succeeded in mining.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.193
It looks like
we're falling behind in mining.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.493
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded in mining.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.453
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:34.665
Team SNU in Medicine's miner
requested a change of position.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:38.503
I'll get going. I think I'm done.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.839
Team POSTECH's miner
requested a change of position.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.425
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAN SEO-YEON
AND TEAM POSTECH'S PARK SEO-YEON GO IN

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.637
- How's it going?
- What?

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.848
- Our returns are higher.
- Really?

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.309
So the mining is the issue.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.103
I'll try to speed it up.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.438
MEDICAL DIVISION ALSO PREPARES
FOR THE BEAR MARKET

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.273
I'd like to sell eight pink coins.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.235
I'd like to check
the stock of silver coins.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.362
- Silver, please.
- I'll check them.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.697
I have 25 coins in stock.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.200
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:13.079
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in five minutes.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.917
We're asking about the price gain
from Round 5 to 6.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.669
- All 25 silver coins are in stock.
- I see.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.546
But Ji-min just entered the Exchange.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.172
- He did?
- Yes, just now.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.424
Team KAIST's buying.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.759
1 MINUTE AGO

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.719
RAN INTO TEAM KAIST'S JEON JI-MIN
ON HIS WAY OUT

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:32.932
Maybe he's checking the stock.
Both sides cashed in on all their assets.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:36.060
That means they knew
about the bear market too.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.062
Please check the pink coin's stock.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.313
- The pink coins?
- Yes.

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:41.691
- I have 18 coins.
- Eighteen?

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.776
18 PINK COINS IN STOCK
Thank you.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.155
- He has 18 coins.
- The pink ones?

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.656
- What an awkward number.
- It is.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.409
- Maybe one team didn't sell theirs?
- There are 18 pink coins.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.996
- All this is just...
- Do we have any pink coins?

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.707
- No, we've got nothing.
- They kept seven coins?

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.251
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.171
I want to sell these eight pink coins.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.007
I have these pink coins...

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:11.596
I'd like to sell just one coin for now.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.516
- Hey, Min-seo.
- My mind is whirling.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.103
Go to the Exchange
and sell all pink coins we've got.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.606
- All our pink coins?
- Yes, all of them.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.400
I thought STEM Division
would also check the stock.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:28.404
So I only sold one pink coin initially
to confuse them.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.703
- I don't get their plan.
- Their strategy must be different.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.499
MEDICAL DIVISION IS ON THE HUNT
FOR ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMER

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:40.750
From Round 5 to 6.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:45.588
MEDICAL DIVISION FOUND OUT
ROUND 6'S HIGHEST-EARNING COIN

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.966
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in one minute.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.470
We've got to hit the Exchange
the moment Round 5 begins.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.222
STEM guys are probably going to--

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.015
- Ask the same questions we did?
- Yeah.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.683
So we should be ready
the moment Round 4 ends.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.560
Should I stay in line?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.063
- We should wait in line here.
- Yes, it's necessary.

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:05.191
I'm sure they're going to ask
about the price gain from Round 5 to 6.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.901
So let's wait in line

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.612
and enter the Exchange
the moment they say Round 5 is live.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.116
TEAM POSTECH'S JAE SEUNG-GYU
GOES INTO THE INQUIRY BOOTH

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:19.080
STEM DIVISION IS INDEED LOOKING
FOR ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.874
It's the pink coin.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.751
What a relief.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:29.340
That concludes Round 4 of Mine and Trade.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.969
Coin prices in Round 5
will now be revealed.

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.974
LEE SEUNG-HYEON SIGNALS HIS ALLIES

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.600
Can we get in line already?

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.227
MEDICAL DIVISION LINES UP
THE MOMENT ROUND 5 BEGINS

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.270
Can we get in line?

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:43.604
...8,000 won.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.148
- Shouldn't we get in line as well?
- I know. They beat us to it.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.441
STEM DIVISION MISSED THEIR CHANCE

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.862
Coin prices in Round 5
will now be revealed.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:57.159
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 5

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.997
It's the Great Depression, man.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.457
- Dang.
- Pink coin, 9,000 won.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.918
Purple coin, 10,000 won.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.588
Guys.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.592
Suppose we can't buy pink coins.
What's our plan?

00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:14.218
Then, we're in trouble.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.470
It looks like
Medical guys are trying to buy it.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.266
- Do I just leave if pink coins are out?
- Yes, do that.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:24.186
Shouldn't we prepare for Round 10
and start building our portfolio?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.857
Considering Round 10, we should buy coins
when the prices are ultra-low.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.735
Don't you think it's about time
we purchased blue coins?

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:34.864
- It wouldn't hurt even if we went all-in.
- "All-in?"

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.949
Has any other coin
dropped below 6,000 won?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.951
- I don't think so.
- It's the lowest.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.287
Should we just empty our pockets?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.873
- Let's buy the cheap ones.
- We'll still have some funds left.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.709
We'll be in trouble
if Medical Division buys everything.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.002
Shall we wait in line?

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.962
- Yes, let's wait in line.
- Okay.

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.843
Why don't we find out

00:18:55.926 --> 00:19:00.890
which coin will see profit
between this round and Round 9?

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.475
Good idea. We can hold on to it.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:05.394
We might not be able to buy it
if we're too late.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.396
We have enough funds anyway.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.273
Blue or red coins are pretty cheap.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.943
Let's ask if the sum of their prices
goes up in Round 9.

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.404
STEM DIVISION WANTS TO BUY
BLUE AND RED COINS WHEN THEY'RE CHEAP

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.115
DOES THE SUM OF THE PRICE GAIN
OF BLUE AND RED COINS

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.700
FROM ROUND 5 TO ROUND 9 EXCEED ZERO?

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.245
Hey, he's back. What did you get?

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.538
The sum exceeds zero.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.332
- Shall we buy them?
- Let's do it.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.668
We can buy both blue and red coins...

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.878
Let's buy them now.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.681
KIM DONG-GEON LOOKS TIRED

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.350
Go take some rest.

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:50.439
Team SNU in STEM's miner
requested a change of position.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.527
I'll handle it.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:02.618
I'd like to check the pink coin's stock.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.245
CHECKING THE STOCK
OF ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:13.003
I have 25 pink coins.

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:15.715
MEDICAL DIVISION DIDN'T BUY PINK COINS

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:17.717
I'd like eight pink coins.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.222
He had all 25 pink coins,
so I bought 8 pieces.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.142
You can buy nine pieces.
The others can get a mix of blue and red.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.435
Great.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.479
I'd like to buy eight pink coins.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.356
Nine pink coins, please.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:37.194
- Thank goodness pink coins were in stock.
- Are we also buying the blue and the red?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.697
Yes, I told them to buy
five of each color.

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.700
I still can't believe
pink coins were in stock.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:46.537
It's satisfying and confusing
at the same time, isn't it?

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.956
- What did they buy, then?
- I wonder that too.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.877
I'd like to buy 5 blue coins
and 5 red coins.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.839
I have five blue coins,
but red coins are not in stock.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.258
NO RED COIN REMAINS

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.179
I'd like to buy eight red coins.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.638
Eight red coins, please.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.141
I'll take all the remaining red coins.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:08.893
MEDICAL DIVISION: RED
STEM DIVISION: PINK

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.898
FROM ROUND 5 TO 6,
BOTH COINS GET A 3,000-WON INCREASE

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:17.318
- Red is out, but blue is in full stock.
- Really?

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.613
All we have is how the sum will change,
so it's hard to decide.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:21.864
- Red coins are out.
- Really?

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:22.948
I couldn't get any.

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.618
- What were you told to buy?
- Red and blue, five each.

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:28.078
- Should I get blue only?
- Yes, get ten.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:35.795
I think the STEM guys got in line
to buy the cheaper coins.

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:37.922
The bear market slashed the prices.

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:41.258
So I suggest we buy silver coins.

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.719
Let's split it three ways.
We'll claim it first.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.514
- I wonder what they're after.
- Let's analyze them--

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:48.557
- We can ask them directly.
- We can.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.934
They can just refuse to tell us.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.561
Excuse me.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.064
Can you tell us what you're buying?

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:58.567
- A coin in one of the ROYGBIV.
- One of the ROYGBIV?

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.194
- That was clever.
- Just kidding.

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.613
- So?
- He wants one of the rainbow colors.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.114
He said ROYGBIV.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.950
And he's going for one of them?

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.661
- It's a technically true statement.
- Diversification is wise.

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.788
Scale trading, right?

00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:13.666
MEDICAL DIVISION TRIES TO BUY CHEAP COINS

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:15.584
Can I check the blue coin's stock?

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:17.920
I have two blue coins in stock.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:18.963
Two?

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.134
I'd like to buy 2 blue coins
and 8 silver coins.

00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:26.846
How many silver coins remain?

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:28.472
I have 17 in stock.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.766
I'll take eight pieces.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.186
HE SEEMS TO BE SHORT ON FUNDS

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:39.650
Can I take that back?
I don't think I have enough cash.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.486
I'll take five instead.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.073
Why don't we check the blue coin's price?

00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:47.825
We can ask if it will drop again.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.661
But the queries cost too much.

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:51.579
That's true.

00:22:52.246 --> 00:22:54.415
But it can't drop further
in the next round.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.208
I won't say I'm not anxious,

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:59.003
but we got the blue coin
at an incredibly low price.

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.630
I think we should hold on to it
no matter what.

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.841
Even if the price drops,
we still bought it at 6,000 won.

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.510
We used the surplus funds
for that investment.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:09.221
That concludes Round 5.

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.808
Coin prices in Round 6
will now be revealed.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:19.356
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 6

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.525
That shot up.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:23.360
Blue went up too.

00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:25.654
Let's ask about Rounds 6 and 7.

00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:29.783
- Let's form a single file.
- Let's wait in the order of arrival.

00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:32.411
Quick, join the line.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.663
Where's this inquisitiveness coming from?

00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:35.581
What happened?

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.708
They must be bubbling with questions.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.128
RIGHT AFTER ROUND 6 BEGAN

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:43.589
Guys, we have to get moving.

00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.883
MEDICAL DIVISION HEADED
TO THE INQUIRY BOOTH

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.428
Guys, let's bag everything
for Rounds 6 to 8.

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:52.264
Let's ask about the trends
of Round 6 to 7 and Round 7 to 8.

00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.642
The six of us can finish things right now.

00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:57.895
To stay ahead of STEM Division,
our goal shouldn't be winning one round

00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.940
but sweeping the highest earners
in the next two rounds.

00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:04.026
THEIR STRATEGY IS TO FIND OUT
THE TOP EARNERS OF ROUNDS 7 AND 8

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.029
FIRST, THEY FOUND OUT THE COIN
WITH THE HIGHEST PRICE GAIN IN ROUND 7

00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:08.697
It's pink, all right.

00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:11.158
Pink? You want us to buy pink coins?

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.702
Please check the pink coin's stock.

00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:17.873
I have six pink coins in stock.

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.708
6 PINK COINS REMAIN

00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:25.506
I'd like to sell
silver coins and red coins.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.718
I'd like to buy 2 pink coins
and 8 blue coins.

00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:32.179
- I don't have any blue coins in stock.
- Okay.

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.431
0 BLUE COIN REMAINS

00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:36.433
How many does he have?

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.185
- He had only six pink coins.
- What?

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:39.603
So I bought two.

00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:43.190
I ordered eight blue coins as well,
just to check on the stock,

00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:44.817
but he didn't have them either.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.318
Go ahead and get pink coins.

00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:48.153
- And--
- What should I sell?

00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:50.864
Everything you've got
except the blue coins.

00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:54.326
I'd like to sell 5 silver coins
and 8 red coins.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.205
I'd like three pink coins.

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:01.458
I'd like to buy three pink coins.

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:04.044
I gave it some thought,

00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:06.839
and there's something
we can't lose sight of.

00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:09.425
We couldn't buy the pink coins
because most of the stock was gone.

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:11.468
That means our opponents have the rest.

00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:15.848
They will benefit from holding on to them,
depriving us of our profit for one round.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.476
MEDICAL DIVISION OWNS 8 PINK COINS
WHERE ARE THE REMAINING 17?

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.895
Can we go to the Exchange
at the last minute

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:24.148
to prevent them
from buying the pink coins?

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.399
5 MINUTES AGO

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.483
I like the idea.

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.444
THEIR STRATEGY IS TO SELL
AT THE LAST MINUTE

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.529
TO PREVENT MEDICAL DIVISION
FROM BUYING THE PINK COIN

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:33.699
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in two minutes.

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.701
STEM DIVISION GOES TO THE EXCHANGE
LATER THAN MEDICAL DIVISION

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.245
Please check the pink coin's stock.

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:39.955
I have six pink coins in stock.

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:43.959
I'd like to buy 2 pink coins
and 8 blue coins.

00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:46.962
I'd like three pink coins.

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:49.590
I'd like to sell
all the pink coins I have.

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:51.633
I'm selling all my pink coins.

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.469
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.305
AT THE MOMENT,
20 PINK COINS REMAIN IN STOCK

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:58.515
SKIPS STOCK CHECK
I'd like to sell

00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:01.226
eight red coins.

00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:04.313
I'd like to buy three pink coins.

00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:07.900
How much will we lose, then?

00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:08.817
I think...

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.779
It feels like an inflection point for us.

00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:15.824
That concludes Round 6 of Mine and Trade.

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.786
Coin prices in Round 7
will now be revealed.

00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:22.331
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 7

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.250
- Which coins do we own now?
- Blue coins.

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:28.212
- How many have we got?
- Twenty in total.

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:30.672
- Its price went down.
- That's right.

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:33.342
Maybe our idea to hold on to it is doomed.

00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:37.179
We have to go.
We can talk it out over there.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.098
MEDICAL DIVISION ON THE MOVE
AS THE NEW ROUND BEGINS

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.893
I'll take nine purple coins, please.

00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:46.188
STEM Division is staying holed up there.

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.690
Maybe they already bought purple coins.

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.109
Guys.

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:52.444
He had 25 coins, so I bought 9.
Go buy 8 coins each.

00:26:52.653 --> 00:26:54.279
Why aren't they buying anything?

00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.615
First things first. Go get our coins.

00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.535
I can't guess what they're thinking.

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:02.329
I know. It's impossible to tell
what they have.

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:07.167
I think Medical Division
is way ahead of us.

00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:10.212
Why don't we find out
the best coin in Round 9?

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.464
It looks like
they had all their queries answered.

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:14.341
Why don't we check the price gain
from Round 8 to 9?

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:15.467
I agree.

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:19.930
SKIPS ROUND 8'S BEST PERFORMER
TO FIND OUT ROUND 9'S HIGHEST EARNER

00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:23.517
MEDICAL DIVISION USES
THE INQUIRY BOOTH NEXT

00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:27.938
MEDICAL DIVISION IS ALSO LOOKING
FOR ROUND 9'S BEST PERFORMER

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:34.903
Is it silver or black?

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.115
Pink, then? It's got to be pink.

00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:41.076
Okay, let's go all-in on pink coins.

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.705
Pink has a higher gain.

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:47.207
- That's the best performer of Round 9?
- I'll go check its price.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:50.752
That concludes Round 7 of Mine and Trade.

00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:54.798
Each division's total assets
will now be revealed.

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:58.427
Let's all pray.

00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:00.637
Come on now.

00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:05.809
Medical Division

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:08.437
has 1,542,000 won.

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:10.189
STEM Division

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.941
has 1,436,000 won.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:15.819
MEDICAL DIVISION HAS A LEAD
OF APPROXIMATELY 100,000 WON

00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:16.737
Thank goodness.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.405
We have a 100,000-won lead!

00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.741
- At this point,
- A whopping 100,000-won gap!

00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:22.868
there's no way they can make a comeback.

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:25.954
...has 1,436,000 won.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:26.914
We're winning.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.210
What a relief.

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.171
Take it in.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.264
The margin isn't so small.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.975
Ten mining can cover that.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.268
That's a piece of cake.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:51.313
Coin prices in Round 8
will now be revealed.

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:55.400
Come on.
Let's see if their alliance crumbles.

00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:57.152
- Open slightly.
- Check the vibe.

00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:59.696
Blue coin, 6,000 won.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.657
BLUE COIN'S PRICE IS IMMOVABLE
Silver coin, 12,000 won.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.451
Purple coin, 18,000 won.

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:06.787
Purple's price skyrocketed.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.830
- Wow, purple is crazy.
- It shot up.

00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:10.040
That's a 4,000-won increase.

00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:12.584
Blue still remains at 6,000 won?

00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:15.212
It's such a shame
we couldn't buy red coins.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.922
- Did red go up a lot?
- Yes.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.633
I regret that we didn't pay
attention to purple.

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:25.389
Team SNU in STEM's miner
requested a change of position.

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:27.933
- I'll go.
- No, it's better if I go.

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:30.269
I tried mining, so I know some tricks.

00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:31.353
Oh, yeah?

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:33.188
Good luck.

00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:36.858
Round 8 of Mine and Trade begins now.

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:38.277
Shall we get the coins?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.444
STEM DIVISION ON THE MOVE
TO BUY PINK COINS

00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:40.696
Are you going to...

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.991
Are we going to make a purchase?

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.117
Sure, we need pink coins.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.202
MEDICAL DIVISION ALSO MOVES OUT
TO BUY PINK COINS

00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:48.996
Let's hurry and get in line.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.498
- Are you going to the Exchange?
- Yes.

00:29:51.832 --> 00:29:53.250
Hey, they beat us to it.

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:54.668
TEAM KAIST'S JEON JI-MIN
ENTERS THE EXCHANGE FIRST

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:58.463
TEAM SNU IN STEM GOT DELAYED
FROM THE MINER EXCHANGE

00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:02.467
We should've gotten here earlier.
This doesn't look good.

00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:04.594
20 PINK COINS REMAIN
I'd like 7 pink coins.

00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:06.346
13 PINK COINS REMAIN
I'd like 4 pink coins.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.639
9 PINK COINS REMAIN
I'd like 7 pink coins.

00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:09.766
2 PINK COINS REMAIN
I'd like 2 pink coins.

00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:11.393
ALL PINK COINS ARE OUT

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.061
That's 24,000 won.

00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:16.189
I'd like to buy 4 black coins
and 6 pink coins.

00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.233
I don't have pink coins in stock.

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:20.610
Here are your four black coins.

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:21.903
FAILED TO GET PINK COINS

00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:24.906
- Pink coins are all out.
- They're out?

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.034
Can we buy green and silver?

00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:29.286
We need to close the gap,
so let's buy them.

00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:31.246
I'll go get 3 green and 3 silver.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.541
- More investment is our only lifeline.
- We're out of options.

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:37.711
I'd like to buy 3 green coins
and 3 silver coins.

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:38.920
PURCHASING REMAINING COINS

00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:43.175
No matter what happens,
their only hope is the blue coin.

00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:45.969
They can only hope
for blue's price to spike.

00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:52.184
How much cash do you guys have?

00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:56.271
We have 14,000 won.

00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.357
No, we've got 19,000 won.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.816
Right, we have 19,000 won.

00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:02.444
We have 21,000 won.

00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:04.946
That's 30,000 won...

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.282
In total, we have 46,000 won.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.950
- You've got 46,000 won?
- Yes.

00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:18.085
That concludes Round 8 of Mine and Trade.

00:31:18.168 --> 00:31:20.754
Coin prices in Round 9
will now be revealed.

00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.214
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 9

00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.132
Blue coin, 5,000 won.

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.509
Blue's price dropped.

00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:27.219
Dang, blue went down further!

00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:29.888
We're so screwed.

00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:32.432
- How come?
- We have heaps of blue coins.

00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:33.892
How much is it?

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.061
It just dropped to 5,000 won.

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:41.316
Round 9 of Mine and Trade begins now.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:47.114
Since our miners have secured
twice as many gold coins as theirs,

00:31:47.197 --> 00:31:50.450
- I know.
- we don't need to take risks.

00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:51.660
STEM DIVISION'S MINING RECORD OF ROUND 8

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:54.246
TEAM KAIST: 3, TEAM POSTECH: 4,
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 5

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.415
COINS MINED IN ROUND 8
MEDICAL DIVISION: 25, STEM DIVISION: 12

00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:57.791
TEAM YONSEI: 9

00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:00.919
TEAM YONSEI MINED 9 COINS,
THE MOST AMONG ALL TEAMS

00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:06.383
Team Yonsei succeeded in mining.

00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:10.011
It's electrifying, isn't it?

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:14.683
IN 25 MINUTES, PARK SANG-YEON SOLVED
5 10-DIGIT MULTIPLICATION QUESTIONS

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.019
Our miners secured
twice as many gold coins as theirs.

00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:20.522
We need to stop them
from earning a whole lot.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.858
We can lump either blue or pink

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.652
with green, silver, and black,
and check if their sum increases.

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:28.780
If the answer is yes, we hold on to them.
If not, we cash in.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.200
In that case, let's go with pink.

00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:35.078
- I'll use pink instead of blue.
- Okay.

00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:37.831
- Just a minute.
- Should we even ask?

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.875
- It's the last round.
- It's a waste of money.

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:43.336
We now have to accept
that our division is going to lose.

00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.298
Our miners are falling behind too.

00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:47.674
Right? What should we do?

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:51.303
I may have counted wrong,
but I'm sure we beat Team KAIST.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.597
- We mined at least ten more coins,
- Really?

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.016
- so we definitely beat them.
- That's the gap?

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:59.769
But I'm not sure about Team POSTECH.
The difference may be 4 or 5.

00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.063
Things weren't looking so good.

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:07.235
Our division purchased blue coin,
but its price continued to drop.

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:08.945
It was no longer
about beating Medical Division

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:13.867
but narrowing down the gap
between the other two STEM teams and us.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.703
Our next goal is
to eliminate any possible variables.

00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:19.706
We should match whatever asset we have
with Team POSTECH's.

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:20.790
- That's the best.
- Right.

00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:22.083
Team KAIST's already in the ditch.

00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:27.047
If the three STEM teams had
an almost identical portfolio,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.341
that would remove
any surprise factor from investments,

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:32.552
allowing us to reframe the game
into a mining match.

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:36.223
We need you to stay focused.

00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:39.768
Prioritizing our survival
would be for the best, right?

00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:43.480
Look, they're acting separately too.

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:46.441
- I have a question.
- Okay.

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:49.778
Suppose we lost to the Medical Division.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:52.239
- Among the three STEM teams...
- Our rank?

00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.157
I can't be sure.

00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:55.784
Is the difference small?

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.120
Yes, because all three teams invested
under the same strategy.

00:34:00.497 --> 00:34:04.000
I think we should start considering

00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:07.212
whether we can outperform
the other STEM teams.

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:10.632
When I checked the assets,
we had slightly more than the others.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:13.927
- We have 480,000 won.
- How much did our division have in total?

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.886
About 1,430,000 won.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.264
Multiply what we have by 3,
and you get 144.

00:34:17.347 --> 00:34:19.391
- So at least one team has fewer than us.
- You're right.

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:22.519
The winner will be
the team with the best miners.

00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:24.437
The STEM team that survives

00:34:24.521 --> 00:34:27.440
will be the one with miners
that secure the most coins.

00:34:27.524 --> 00:34:29.818
Another possible scenario
is blue skyrocketing.

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.653
- Blue may skyrocket.
- We have ten blue coins.

00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:35.448
With a 5,000-won spike,
we'll get 25,000 won more than the others.

00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:37.117
That's a huge margin.

00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:41.037
Is the main difference
between us and Team POSTECH

00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:43.290
- the five blue coins?
- Pink as well.

00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:44.457
- Pink?
- They have five more.

00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:46.418
But we have more cash.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.336
- We do?
- Yes.

00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:51.881
MINERS' PERFORMANCE WILL DECIDE
THE TWO TEAMS IN THE DEATHMATCH

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.432
This is killing me. I'm tired.

00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:02.392
I'm starting to feel drained too.

00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:04.185
No, I can still do this.

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.812
Let's focus on our tasks.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.191
I think we'll get a good final score
thanks to you.

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.277
You'll probably get us a big win.

00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:15.363
- What's the verdict?
- Negative.

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:16.615
These three don't exceed zero.

00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:18.700
- Do we sell everything?
- We have to.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.745
Let's cash in pink,
black, silver, and green coins.

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.663
Leave only the blue coins.

00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:26.124
We're staking our lives on blue, right?

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.834
- Please.
- Please!

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.669
May it skyrocket.

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:31.880
Come here, Jong-yun.

00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:36.134
Should we buy blue coins
if any are in stock?

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:38.720
- It's better to match with Team POSTECH.
- Agreed.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.263
- Do I buy it if there is any?
- Yes.

00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:41.806
- We must close in on them.
- Right.

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:45.018
Could you check the blue coin's stock?

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:47.604
I don't have any blue coins in stock.

00:35:48.772 --> 00:35:50.899
I'd like to sell
4 black, 2 pink, 3 silver,

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.026
and 3 green coins.

00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.990
Team SKKU succeeded in mining.

00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.450
Another gold coin?

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:02.786
Has any of your teammates stayed
in the Mining Room all this time?

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.621
- Yes.
- Anyone mining five hours straight?

00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.040
I'm so grateful to him.

00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:08.667
He moves me to tears.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.544
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S KIM MIN-SEOK
HASN'T ASKED FOR A POSITION CHANGE

00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:18.927
DURING THE 4-HOUR GAME TIME,
HE SINGLE-HANDEDLY MINED 29 GOLD COINS

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:23.306
- I think we should stay on until the end.
- Okay.

00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:27.018
NEITHER MINERS OF TEAM SKKU

00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:29.896
ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THEIR DUTIES

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:34.025
TEAM SKKU'S KIM DONG-YEON
MINED 21 COINS DURING 4 HOURS

00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:37.070
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU
MINED 36 COINS DURING 4 HOURS

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.154
OVERALL 1ST PLACE

00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:41.324
A position swap

00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:43.660
would've required information exchange,
possibly wasting our time

00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:45.370
and messing up our tempo.

00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:47.372
I had a small pain in my back,

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.791
but that eased up
when I shifted my position.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.127
So I decided to stay on until the end.

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:56.423
SELLING EVERYTHING EXCEPT BLUE
Here are 3 silver coins and 7 pink coins.

00:36:56.506 --> 00:37:00.135
I'd like to sell 7 pink coins
and 3 green coins.

00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:03.722
- How's it going for us?
- What?

00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:06.516
First off, we sold everything
that generated any value.

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:10.019
Realistically speaking,
I don't think STEM Division can win.

00:37:10.103 --> 00:37:12.021
- What?
- We won't be able to win.

00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:13.231
- It's unlikely?
- Yes.

00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:19.070
The only difference between the teams is
that we have ten blue coins.

00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.488
The others have five each.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:22.407
- That's a gamble.
- That's right.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.284
If blue rises by 5,000 won, we win.

00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:28.663
If blue gets a 10,000-won spike,
then our whole division can win.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.749
Because we hold a lot of them?

00:37:31.207 --> 00:37:33.126
It could be a mistake.

00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:35.503
The others became our rivals
in an instant.

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.757
Let's say there's a margin
of four gold coins.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.259
The differences may be tiny.

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:42.886
This is frustrating.

00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:46.306
Team SNU in STEM succeeded in mining.

00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:48.016
Thank you.

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:51.186
I don't know if it's Dong-geon
or Myeong-su, but I'm grateful.

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.687
That was a clutch move.

00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:56.983
Our freshmen duo is doing a fine job.

00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.401
Tell me about it. I'm so grateful.

00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:00.779
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S FRESHMEN DUO
DOING THEIR BEST UNTIL THE END

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.948
It helped that we didn't switch
our miners and traders as much.

00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:05.492
It was for the better.

00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:06.743
4 TRADERS STAYED ON THROUGHOUT THE GAME

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.536
How big is our lead in mining
from Round 7?

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.414
- It's huge.
- It's really huge.

00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:13.708
- It's way too big.
- Absurdly so.

00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:14.793
They can't overcome this.

00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:17.128
- Turns out we didn't contribute much.
- Definitely.

00:38:17.212 --> 00:38:19.130
We might have burned away 100,000 won.

00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:20.924
Honestly? I think that's a possibility.

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:23.968
The whole game taught us
the true worth of honest work.

00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.929
Never dream of hitting the jackpot.

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:27.847
- "Don't invest in crypto."
- "Get help for addiction."

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:33.144
That concludes Round 9 of Mine and Trade.

00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:35.063
- Great work today.
- Thanks.

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:38.358
Really though, my number crunching
won't have been for nothing.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.235
The game ended, no?

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.696
Oh, what a bummer.
All that remained was the addition.

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:44.864
You were amazing.

00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:47.242
KIM JAE-HAN WAS THE ONLY STEM CONTESTANT
WHO DIDN'T ASK FOR A POSITION SWAP

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:48.785
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:51.204
I think it's over now.

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.957
- Let's still finish it.
- Okay.

00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:58.711
We pulled our weight big time.
We mined 57 coins.

00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:02.090
We're going to win. That's for sure.

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.508
There's no way we'll lose.

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:06.344
All contestants,
please come to the Main Hall

00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:09.764
and stand before your base camps.

00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:18.356
Now that we're lined up like this,
it hits me that we're on different teams.

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:20.066
But we were besties earlier.

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:21.901
I'm sure we're going to win.

00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:24.195
HIS PERSONAL HOPES
The blue will cost 20,000 won.

00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:27.782
Coin prices in Round 10
will now be revealed.

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:34.831
Black coin, 13,000 won.

00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:37.375
Red coin, 18,000 won.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:38.543
MEDICAL DIVISION'S INVESTMENTS
ALL PAID OFF

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.044
Blue coin...

00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:41.963
Oh, come on.

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:48.595
Blue coin, 7,000 won.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:51.472
BLUE COIN ONLY HAD A 2,000-WON INCREASE

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.017
That's good for us.

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:56.144
We won 10,000 won more than the others.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.105
Nice, I'm so relieved.

00:39:59.188 --> 00:40:00.273
- Is that a good thing?
- Yeah.

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:02.567
STEM Division took a gamble
on the blue coin.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.027
- It didn't go up that much.
- No.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.612
Pink coin, 14,000 won.

00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:09.616
Purple coin, 17,000 won.

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:16.039
That concludes the main match,
Mine and Trade.

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:19.542
The total assets for each division
will now be announced.

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.044
Medical Division

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:24.589
has 2,205,000 won in total.

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:25.798
STEM Division

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:28.676
has 1,764,000 won in total.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.429
Medical Division wins the game.

00:40:36.476 --> 00:40:39.187
Our division had better talents.
It wasn't surprising.

00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:42.815
My teammate's mining
drove the division's victory,

00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:45.652
so I'm grateful to them.

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.740
Each team's total assets
will now be revealed.

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:52.575
Gosh, I'm shaking.

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:53.910
Team SNU in Medicine

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:55.745
has 709,000 won.

00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:57.497
Team Yonsei

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.248
has 731,000 won.

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.042
Team SKKU

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.211
has 765,000 won.

00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.673
You mined that much?
Oh, the benefit of 20,000 won.

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:10.343
- We did better even without the benefit.
- Good job, team.

00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:13.012
Team SNU in STEM

00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:16.265
has 629,000 won.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.060
Team KAIST...

00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:23.815
has 539,000 won.

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:25.692
TEAM KAIST WILL COMPETE IN THE DEATHMATCH

00:41:25.775 --> 00:41:27.819
I thought, "Shoot, we're in trouble."

00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:30.113
Team POSTECH...

00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:32.198
TO SURVIVE, TEAM POSTECH'S ASSET
MUST EXCEED 630,000 WON

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:35.535
...has 596,000 won.

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:36.911
We're 30,000 won short.

00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:38.871
If only we had 30,000 won more.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.041
TEAM SNU IN STEM SURVIVES
BY 30,000-WON DIFFERENCE

00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.252
I was relieved that we survived.

00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:49.173
Team SNU in STEM is advancing.

00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.842
- It's a rival match.
- KAIST versus POSTECH.

00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:52.051
Is it POSTECH versus KAIST?

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.761
The lowest-ranking two teams,

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.015
Team KAIST and Team POSTECH,

00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.934
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.353
We can beat them.

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:04.522
Don't get nervous. We can beat them.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:09.819
We go against Team POSTECH
this season, too?

00:42:14.824 --> 00:42:16.534
Good luck.

00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:20.663
I wonder when we first messed up.

00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:23.249
Still, I'm so relieved we mined
the most coins in our division.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.126
TOTAL MINED COINS

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.754
BEST IN MEDICAL DIVISION
TEAM YONSEI AND TEAM SKKU, 57 COINS

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:29.839
BEST IN STEM DIVISION
TEAM SNU IN STEM, 48 COINS

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:33.843
We're home.

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:37.764
We are victorious.

00:42:37.847 --> 00:42:38.765
Good work.

00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:40.683
- Well done.
- Great work, everyone.

00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:42.560
Great work, everyone.

00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.896
- Thank you.
- Thanks for everything.

00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:46.189
That was fun.

00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:47.940
- Because we won.
- Of course.

00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:50.068
Guys, we took them down a peg.

00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:53.279
- Without the benefit, we're the best.
- That's true.

00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:59.118
The Deathmatch will now begin.

00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:02.205
TEAM KAIST VS TEAM POSTECH

00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:04.707
I never thought we'd end up
in the Deathmatch on our first day.

00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:07.251
Still, we were against Team POSTECH,
the weakest team.

00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:08.336
That eased my mind.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:12.006
I said to myself,
"We're going to win this no matter what."

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:15.134
In this show,
Team POSTECH always lost to Team KAIST.

00:43:15.218 --> 00:43:16.886
We deserved to win at least once.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:19.514
I thought, "This is our shot."

00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:24.268
It weighs on me to see them
have a face-off at the Deathmatch.

00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:26.229
It's a bleak situation.

00:43:26.312 --> 00:43:30.066
- We're losing a dependable ally.
- Right.

00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:31.734
Tell me about it.

00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:35.947
Today's Deathmatch is

00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:38.116
Double-sided Bingo.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.784
Bingo?

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:41.619
Double-sided Bingo?

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:43.496
In Double-sided Bingo,

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.541
you will be given tiles
with different colors on each side

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:49.460
to place on a 4-by-4 bingo board.

00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.879
The first to get a bingo
by filling a line with the same color

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.673
wins the game.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.675
That sounds interesting.

00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:57.260
This should be fun.

00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:58.886
The contestants will receive

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:02.431
a set of tiles
painted in red, yellow, or blue.

00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:05.143
Each piece has a different color
on each side,

00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:08.354
and each set includes nine tiles.

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.565
The color covering the majority
of the front side

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:13.234
should be the same
on four neighboring squares

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.695
for you to get a bingo.

00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:17.446
Consider the board on screen.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.366
We have a bingo from the red column.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.701
With a red-yellow tile...

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.744
You'd have red on the front
and yellow on the back.

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:24.704
I get it now.

00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:27.456
- They put a frame for us to understand.
- Right.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.418
It's the color in the center that counts.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:34.755
Out of a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal line,

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:38.009
all four tiles must be of the same color
for you to get a bingo.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:39.635
Before we begin,

00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:44.515
each player will be assigned a color
for them to get a bingo.

00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:47.310
The designated colors will not match,

00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:49.520
and they will remain undisclosed.

00:44:49.604 --> 00:44:51.230
There's room for mind tricks.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.316
Since they won't know
each other's assigned color,

00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.067
they can fool their opponent.

00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:57.486
- Bluffing may help in some cases.
- Exactly.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.907
But you may end up
helping your opponent while bluffing.

00:45:01.324 --> 00:45:03.826
Two players will take turns
to place their tiles.

00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:07.622
Once both players
have placed seven tiles each,

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:10.291
they will be allowed
to either place a new tile

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:15.004
or maneuver one of the placed ones
starting from their eighth turn.

00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:18.382
First, they can move one of the tiles
to a neighboring empty square

00:45:18.466 --> 00:45:22.178
regardless of the color it is showing.

00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:26.098
But you can't move the tile diagonally.

00:45:26.182 --> 00:45:27.683
But with 14 tiles placed,

00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.769
- there's not much room to move.
- Right.

00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:32.230
Still, moving the tiles around
can be the only option

00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.440
- when playing defensively.
- Exactly.

00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:38.110
Second, they can flip one of the tiles
placed on the board

00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:42.573
regardless of the color it is showing.

00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:46.786
You'll have to keep flipping
to show your assigned color.

00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:52.333
You must remember
that you can't move or flip the tile

00:45:53.376 --> 00:45:55.711
that your opponent placed, moved,
or flipped in their latest turn.

00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:57.380
OPPONENT'S TILE IS OFF-LIMITS FOR 1 TURN

00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.257
You can't touch the tile
the other just touched.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.633
That's intense.

00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:03.469
The latest tile being off-limits
makes it really hard.

00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:08.516
The first to get a bingo
of their designated color wins.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:12.019
There will be three rounds in total.

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:14.855
Each round will be played
on a one-on-one basis.

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:18.985
Rounds 1 and 2 require different players,
but anyone can participate in Round 3.

00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.611
Out of a total of three rounds,

00:46:20.695 --> 00:46:24.907
the team that secures two wins first
will be declared the winner.

00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:29.495
I started playing chess at a young age,

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.914
so I knew I could handle
a turn-based game.

00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:34.166
I thought, "I'm sure to win."

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.879
Usually, I can see 13 to 20 moves ahead
in a game of Connect Five.

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:41.132
So I felt confident about my chances.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:45.970
The team to go first in Round 1
will be decided by Team POSTECH

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.180
as they held more assets
in the main match.

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:51.225
They get to decide
since they had more money.

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:52.685
Won't they go first?

00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:56.188
Since they can move or flip
a tile starting from the eighth turn...

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.524
- First player gets the advantage.
- Sure.

00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:01.444
Both teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:05.031
I have to try it to get the hang of it.

00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:07.950
Do you think there's a strategy
that will guarantee a win?

00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.661
All right. Hit me with your ideas.

00:47:10.745 --> 00:47:13.581
I think we should claim the four corners

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:16.167
since they're necessary
in the intersecting lines.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.376
- Do you follow?
- Yes.

00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:18.711
Let's say my color is red.

00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:20.755
With a yellow-red tile
and a blue-red tile in each row,

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.967
covering all four corners
to stop the opponent...

00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:28.137
- From using their assigned color?
- Yes, exactly.

00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:30.389
If you secure all four corners

00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:33.267
using tiles with your color
with a different-colored rim,

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:37.897
you hold two squares of horizontal,
vertical, and diagonal lines.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.692
Then, you can force your opponent
to play on the defensive from all angles.

00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.237
Even if your opponent
flips the tile in the top row

00:47:45.321 --> 00:47:47.573
to show their assigned color, yellow,

00:47:47.656 --> 00:47:49.992
they won't be able to get a bingo.

00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:53.079
Even if your opponent has blue
as their designated color,

00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:55.790
flipping the tile in the bottom row

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.584
won't get them a bingo.

00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:01.462
At the start,
prioritize securing the four corners

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:03.839
and eliminating any threats.

00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:06.926
Wait, but...

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:10.388
The more I study the board,
the more important the center seems.

00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:14.141
All possible lines
intersect in this region,

00:48:14.225 --> 00:48:16.143
so our focus should be here.

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:19.480
I suggest claiming two squares
in the center region.

00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:23.317
When your tile is in the center,
you have four options to spread out.

00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:26.487
Dominating the center region
was the priority.

00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:29.365
Won't the tiles in the outer region
have more value?

00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:30.408
In terms of value?

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.120
But center spots give you
more options to spread out.

00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:37.832
In bingo, the four center squares
are the most important.

00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.709
- Yes, they are.
- The center is the main battlefield.

00:48:40.793 --> 00:48:43.212
But the players can move the tiles.

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:45.798
The tiles in the center
can be moved elsewhere.

00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.258
- Yes, that's true.
- Right.

00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:49.385
TEAM POSTECH: CORNER-ORIENTED APPROACH

00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:51.053
TEAM KAIST: CENTER-ORIENTED APPROACH

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.930
Let's say I'm the first player.

00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:54.056
TEAM KAIST'S PRACTICE GAME

00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:58.561
I can win this way, right?

00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:01.147
When I flip this later, it's game over.

00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:02.565
The first player

00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:04.775
- can flip a tile first, right?
- Yes.

00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:06.986
- I see.
- The first player gets that advantage.

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.155
We'll have to figure out
the opponent's color quickly,

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.531
especially if we're going second.

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.950
If we're going second,
we'll have to play defensively

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:14.034
in most cases.

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.077
In most cases, yes.

00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:18.372
What do you think
Team POSTECH will choose?

00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:20.499
They'll probably go first in Round 1.

00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:24.253
Now, we should decide
on our player roster.

00:49:24.587 --> 00:49:26.839
Want to give it a go, Ji-hoo?
You've had a drill.

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:28.716
- Get us an upset win.
- Win for us.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:32.845
Going second is a huge disadvantage,
but I'll do my best to win.

00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:35.055
Okay, then. Ji-hoo will play in Round 1.

00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.433
Do we have any volunteers first?

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:38.684
I'd like to play.

00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:40.352
- I want you to play, too.
- All right.

00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:42.605
I'm good with games
that involve mind games,

00:49:42.688 --> 00:49:44.523
and I have a lot of experience.

00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:47.193
I felt certain I could defeat anyone.

00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:51.697
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.034
- I've got to have faith in myself.
- Have faith.

00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:57.328
Great. I feel like we won already.

00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:59.288
- Why don't we do our chant?
- Guys!

00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:01.081
One, two, three.

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.501
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:05.711
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:07.880
- Want to do ours here?
- Let's do it.

00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:09.590
- POSTECH!
- Let's go!

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.176
It's all about the attitude.

00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:14.011
We practically won already.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:14.929
We won.

00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:20.309
DEATHMATCH
DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO

00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:27.983
Which team should I root for?
This is driving me nuts.

00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:29.235
The winner is our ally.

00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:31.654
Should I hope for one team
to dominate the match?

00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:35.533
Then, we'll have that competent team
as our ally tomorrow.

00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:38.160
- Why do we always end up here?
- Tell me about it.

00:50:39.245 --> 00:50:42.039
One of my goals was
to contribute to Team KAIST's elimination.

00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:44.917
I was happy
to be given the chance to do so.

00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:48.170
I've got a good feeling about this.

00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:52.341
We will now begin the Deathmatch,
Double-sided Bingo.

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:57.763
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 1.

00:50:58.264 --> 00:50:59.348
Team KAIST.

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:02.851
Kang Ji-hoo will play
for Team KAIST in Round 1.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.772
I, Lee Jun-u, will play for Team POSTECH.

00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:09.108
So it's you.

00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:13.153
A FACE-OFF BETWEEN ALUMNI
OF GYEONGGIBUK SCIENCE HIGH

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:14.989
He was one year ahead of you, right?

00:51:15.781 --> 00:51:18.742
What's with the look he's giving you?

00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:21.537
That means all he can do
is try to get under my skin.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.833
He's always been like that.
I'm not even bothered.

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.960
I know him well enough.

00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:32.131
He's always been very playful
when we were in high school together.

00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:36.635
So I expected him to try
to shake me that way.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:41.932
Both teams, please take an envelope
and check your designated color.

00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:12.880
The players for Round 1,
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.841
and Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo,
please come up to the stage.

00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:26.810
- It's been a while.
- It's nice to see you here.

00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:29.438
What's your assigned color?

00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.982
Don't pry on me just yet.

00:52:32.066 --> 00:52:34.109
- You'll use your color right away, no?
- You will, won't you?

00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:35.110
You bet I will.

00:52:35.194 --> 00:52:38.197
- Both of them seem so at ease.
- So relaxed.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.990
As expected from someone
who shares my name.

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:42.159
Ji-hoo's yapping
to make Jun-u lose his cool.

00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:47.081
That's so him.

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:50.167
When it comes to games,
I can be a nightmarish opponent.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:54.630
I kept talking to Jun-u to irritate him
and shake him off mentally.

00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:58.467
I tried maintaining my composure
to play the game at my pace.

00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:03.972
As Team POSTECH had
bigger total assets in the main match,

00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:06.392
they will decide which team goes first.

00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:07.393
Please make your choice.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.813
I'll go first.

00:53:11.605 --> 00:53:14.149
That's actually better.
He can play as he practiced.

00:53:14.817 --> 00:53:16.944
Did you have to be selfish and go first?

00:53:18.404 --> 00:53:20.489
Your jokes are helping me relax.

00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:25.494
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u.
Please place your tile.

00:53:26.537 --> 00:53:28.539
You have one minute.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.719
That would mean
his color is yellow or red.

00:53:41.802 --> 00:53:44.388
Could he have chosen that tile
to dupe Ji-hoo?

00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:47.850
You can't tell at first.

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:49.977
So your color is yellow, right?

00:53:51.729 --> 00:53:52.980
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:54.231
Please place your tile.

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.282
What was that about?

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:04.450
It's a tactical move.

00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.535
He showed so much spirit there.

00:54:06.618 --> 00:54:08.704
Deathmatches are all about attitude.

00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:10.456
That's true.

00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:20.966
He's not hiding that it's yellow.

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:22.426
He's not hiding it at all.

00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:29.933
Two red tiles in a row.

00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:33.187
He's as good as admitted
that his color is red, hasn't he?

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.230
"Hey, my assigned color is red."

00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:37.775
His color is red.
That's almost a declaration.

00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:40.527
Jun-u's color is yellow,
and Ji-hoo's color is red?

00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:42.154
- It looks that way.
- Right.

00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:44.156
It looks like they're going head-to-head.

00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:49.369
TEAM KAIST: RED, TEAM POSTECH: YELLOW

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.247
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u.
Please place your tile.

00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:02.299
He's decided that the four corners
would give him an edge.

00:55:03.342 --> 00:55:08.055
I think his plan is
to claim all four corners.

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.642
I thought the center section
had more strategic value,

00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:14.102
but Jun-u kept placing his tiles
on the corners.

00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:15.604
So you like the corners?

00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:21.360
- Looks like I'll beat my disadvantage.
- You have ten seconds left.

00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:27.533
Ji-hoo seems to be set on gaining
full control in the center.

00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:29.576
He's going to take
the four squares in the center.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.911
I think so too.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:33.205
Their strategies
are drastically different.

00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:36.083
One goes for the center,
the other goes for the corners.

00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:39.503
Will he take all the corners?

00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:41.672
I think that's likely

00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:45.217
because the diagonal line
has three red tiles on it.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.887
Jun-u will need that corner
for a defensive move.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.146
A DEFENSIVE MOVE USING
A TILE WITHOUT TEAM KAIST'S COLOR

00:55:58.564 --> 00:56:00.941
There we go. That was good.

00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:05.779
I think he saw Ji-hoo's color as red
and made the best defensive move he could.

00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:08.323
You're smart. I'll give you that.

00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:09.449
What do I do next?

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:15.205
I know your color is yellow.

00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:22.880
TEAM KAIST CAN GET A BINGO
IF LEFT UNCHECKED

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.799
LEE JUN-U'S DEFENSIVE MOVE

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:27.384
He just won, didn't he?

00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:28.427
Jun-u did, yes.

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:30.762
Did we just lose?

00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:34.266
It's a double-three situation.
He has another opportunity over there.

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:36.268
If Team POSTECH's player
places a yellow tile

00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:39.062
in either of the highlighted squares,

00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:41.231
as the first player,

00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:45.569
he gets his chance to flip or move a tile
on his eighth turn ahead of his opponent.

00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:48.947
Then, he can get a bingo.

00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:51.867
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:59.833
TEAM POSTECH STILL HAS
ONE VIABLE ROUTE OF ATTACK

00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:01.877
Since Jun-u went first,
he can finish the game

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.587
- by flipping on his next turn.
- Right.

00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:14.932
You have ten seconds left.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.201
He could've won if he had chosen
that empty square. What a bummer.

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.702
Why didn't he do that?

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.955
It can be hard to see it
when you're under pressure.

00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:40.415
I agree. That's possible.

00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:47.506
When Jun-u couldn't find the winning move,
I realized I could beat him.

00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:51.885
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

00:57:51.969 --> 00:57:53.637
Damn, I've been eyeing that spot.

00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:01.019
TEAM POSTECH CREATED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:04.856
We need to counter that,
but we're out of blue-red tiles.

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.484
- Ji-hoo only has blue-yellow tiles.
- Right.

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.490
You have ten seconds left.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.707
- That finishes the game, no?
- No, Jun-u can't flip it.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.626
That one's off-limits.
So they both need to be on defense.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.921
From this point on,
you can place a new tile

00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:31.591
or select one of the tiles on the board
to move or flip it.

00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:34.845
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:37.305
- He needs to flip that red tile.
- Exactly.

00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:42.644
TEAM POSTECH ON DEFENSE

00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.230
Well done. He's doing great.

00:58:45.313 --> 00:58:47.691
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:50.610
He needs to fix

00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:53.363
- the bottom row with yellow tiles.
- He has to.

00:58:53.989 --> 00:58:55.323
You have ten seconds left.

00:59:00.746 --> 00:59:01.997
Yes, he needed that.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.957
Good job.

00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:12.007
- Why did he do that?
- It was necessary.

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.008
If he hadn't,

00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:16.178
Ji-hoo could flip the tile
next to the one Jun-u just flipped

00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:18.472
- and get the double-three.
- Oh, I see.

00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:21.641
You have ten seconds left.

00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:27.773
He launched an attack.

00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:30.192
Jun-u will have to choose one of those

00:59:30.275 --> 00:59:31.610
- to go on defense.
- Won't he pick one

00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.070
to defend and attack at the same time?

00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.825
This won't end until someone moves a tile.

00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:40.619
Both of them only have tiles

00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:43.288
that have the opponent's color.
They can't place any new tiles.

00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:45.624
Placing new tiles is
the last thing on their minds.

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:48.919
I think the game will continue
until one of them messes up.

00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:54.132
- I'll flip this.
- Okay.

00:59:56.802 --> 00:59:58.136
You have ten seconds left.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:05.310
The game won't end at this rate.
How do I finish this?

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.354
He could try moving a tile.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.148
- But can he gain anything from that?
- Not really.

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:13.193
But to break this cycle...

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.408
- Oh, he moved a tile.
- So it begins.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.619
- That was smart, right?
- Yes, agreed.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.579
That eliminated the possibility
of the red column.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:25.497
Right.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.332
I moved the tile

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.668
to remove the chance
of Ji-hoo getting a bingo

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.211
and to seize control of the game.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.171
Jun-u made the smart choice.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.089
He's brilliant.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.299
He came up with a solid strategy.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.843
You have 30 seconds left.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.890
Out of the 6 red-yellow tiles,
5 tiles show red.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.226
Hey, that's impressive.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.270
When did Ji-hoo flip them all?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.231
The game's running smoothly
because both sides have planned ahead.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.692
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:01:00.031
TEAM POSTECH'S LEE JUN-U
FOUND A NEW AVENUE OF ATTACK

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:01.741
- There we go.
- Yes.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.160
That's the right call.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.871
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.921
TEAM KAIST'S KANG JI-HOO FLIPPED
ALL THE RED-YELLOW TILES TO SHOW RED

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.757
Only a few tiles on the board show yellow.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.718
- That's true.
- Jun-u needs to flip them.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:20.802
That's for sure.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.347
But Jun-u had to take that risk
to move the initial tile.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.813
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.116
- It's over.
- It's over?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.826
He's got a double-three.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.037
Ji-hoo can move this tile...

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.790
I mean, he can slide it to the right
or flip that one to get a bingo.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.209
Hey, you're right.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.380
30 MINUTES AGO
If I build enough two-tile blocks

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.174
and claim the center section,

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:02.093
I'll be able to find an angle
to get a double-three.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.848
The moment I got my double-three,
I thought I did it.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.850
That took a weight off my chest.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:12.729
Shoot, he lost.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.189
You can't defend that.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.816
At any rate,
you need a double-three to win.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.235
Looks that way.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.199
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:32.874
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
got a bingo first.

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.046
All right. There we go.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.633
Team POSTECH went first,
but Team KAIST won.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.344
It was fun to watch a game
between skilled players.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.596
Both had a knack
for finding the best moves.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.555
Yes, they did.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.308
Team POSTECH will have to win
two rounds back-to-back to survive.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:51.559
It's pretty difficult.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:52.978
We didn't see that coming.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:58.525
One of my game plans was to provoke Jun-u.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.694
I later regretted it,
thinking maybe I went too far.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.945
I felt so bad for him.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:07.575
Ji-hoo's attempts at shaking me
didn't affect me all that much.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:10.662
Rather, I think I lost
because I got impatient midway.

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.414
That leaves me with regrets.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:18.503
I'm sorry.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:20.005
Dude, don't apologize.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.803
Ji-hoo the Great.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:30.098
Well done.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.184
I shouldn't have moved the tile.
That puts you at a disadvantage.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:35.979
If your opponent keeps
on flipping the tiles, you're helpless.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.940
Your game taught us so much.

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.775
- It was an epic match.
- For sure.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.193
Thanks for the great game.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.074
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 2.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.036
DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO
ROUND 2

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.413
I bet Team KAIST will send in Jeon Ji-min.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.081
- Ji-min...
- He's good.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.792
He seems like the obvious choice.
He's good.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.002
It will be Ji-min.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:02.505
I think the guy who participated
in Primality Test will compete here.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:07.052
Kim Jae-han will play
for Team KAIST in Round 2.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.764
- Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han is competing.
- Not Ji-min?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:14.142
UNEXPECTEDLY, TEAM KAIST'S KIM JAE-HAN
IS PLAYING IN ROUND 2

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:15.060
Good luck.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.269
He doesn't need luck.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.812
Go get them.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.315
We tried a few practice games
by ourselves.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:24.027
We then learned
that Jae-han had an eye for finding angles

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.195
that we couldn't see.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.947
DURING STRATEGY MEETING
KIM JI-U AND JEON JI-MIN'S PRACTICE GAME

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.618
You know, you already lost

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.995
when you placed the red-blue card,
completing the red column.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.747
THE FIRST PLAYER CAN FLIP THE CARD
AND GET A BINGO

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:38.083
Put it here,
and what with the blue tile...

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:39.250
JAE-HAN'S QUICK ANALYSIS

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:42.003
You can flip this,
but once you do, the game is over.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.296
Block some other line, and you lose.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.632
- You're our man, Jae-han.
- You've got this.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.425
You want me to compete?

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:51.012
The game itself
was of the type I enjoy a lot.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:55.141
The problem was that
my nerves often got the better of me.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:56.768
So...

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.896
PRE-PRODUCTION INTERVIEW
KIM JAE-HAN WAS VISIBLY NERVOUS

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.023
What with mathematics... I mean...

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:03.441
I'm sorry.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.278
- It's my kryptonite. I'm just...
- But you did fine just now.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:12.659
Jae-han was hesitant to compete
because of his nerves,

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.953
so I helped him loosen up
as best as I could.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:16.663
You're doing great.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.748
- But...
- He's looking many moves ahead.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:19.707
He's seeing far and wide.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.376
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.379
I think you're great.
You're seeing so many moves ahead.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.089
It feels like we won already.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:30.385
I felt grateful to my teammates,
and I was set on doing my best.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.345
No pressure, though.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.139
You were amazing during practice.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:38.226
No offense to Ji-hoo when he just won,
but I think you're the best, Jae-han.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.644
Just do what you did.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:40.979
TEAMMATES SHOWER HIM WITH COMPLIMENTS

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.355
Team POSTECH.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.275
I, Hwang Seok-hun, will play
for Team POSTECH in Round 2.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:49.237
I knew that my defeat would mean
the end of my team's journey.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.864
So I had to win at all costs.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.952
Both teams, please take an envelope
and check your designated color.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.371
I wonder what our color is

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.457
I wonder what it can be

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.337
Let's see it together.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.886
Someone's got to bluff.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.596
It will be so cool if anyone tries it.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:21.102
The players for Round 2,
please come up to the stage.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.188
- Best of luck.
- You've got this.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.398
Shoot, this is nerve-wracking.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:31.696
I don't want us to leave without a bang.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:35.658
Team KAIST will go first
as their player went second in Round 1.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.828
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
Please place your tile.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.003
KIM JAE-HAN PLACED
A YELLOW TILE IN THE CENTER

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:50.131
That confirms it.
Their strategy is to claim the center.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.718
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.
Please place your tile.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.390
BOTH PLACED A YELLOW TILE EACH

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.683
What?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.769
What the heck? Just a second.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.895
What's going on?

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.855
One of them is bluffing.

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:07.524
Both placed yellow tiles.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.069
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
Please place your tile.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:12.779
PLACED ANOTHER YELLOW TILE

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.822
He's using yellow tiles back-to-back?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.450
Team KAIST's designated color
must be yellow.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:20.620
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun
will now take his turn.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.872
I think Team POSTECH's color is red.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.666
I can't be sure
if their color is blue or red.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.750
I think it's blue.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:29.003
But if so, why put the red side up
instead of the blue side?

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.589
To fool Jae-han completely?

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.592
I thought that it'd give
the second player an edge

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.928
to hide the assigned color.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.264
IMMEDIATELY AFTER ROUND 1
The way I see it,

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:43.142
it's best to place a tile with your color
upside down and flip it later.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.062
When your opponent knows your color,
they'll counter your move at every turn.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.314
You then end up
with endless tile flipping.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:49.941
You're going second,

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.860
so you need to find a way
to take your opponent by surprise.

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:55.613
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.579
- He got the reverse L shape.
- So he did.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.581
The first player has to try their best

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.916
to get the tiles
placed in a reverse L shape.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.126
Once you have that,

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:12.046
you get a two-tile cluster in vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal lines.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.424
If the second player makes
a single mistake,

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:18.595
the first player can strike,
ending the game right then and there.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:21.472
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun
will now take his turn.

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:27.854
I thought, "There we go."

01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:29.355
He won.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.816
- All he has to do is hang in there.
- Right.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.651
If the first player
makes a two-tile cluster,

01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:35.445
the second player can only use a tile

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.488
without the first player's color
for defense.

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:40.658
If they use one
with the first player's color,

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:44.495
the first player can add one more tile
and flip the second player's addition

01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:46.205
to get a bingo first.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:52.295
KIM JAE-HAN USED THE YELLOW TILES
TO QUICKLY MAKE A REVERSE L

01:08:52.378 --> 01:08:55.840
The thing was,
Seok-hun used a tile that included yellow.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.384
HWANG SEOK-HUN USED A TILE
WITH YELLOW ON ONE SIDE

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.219
That convinced me
that I had it in the bag.

01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:03.056
Our strategy
was claiming the corners first,

01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:04.891
and I followed through.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.143
Wait.

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.646
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:13.358
KIM JAE-HAN BUILT A 3-TILE CLUSTER
IN HIS ASSIGNED COLOR

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:16.736
ALL HE HAS TO DO TO GET A BINGO
IS FLIP THE TILE

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.447
Team KAIST went first.
The game is as good as won.

01:09:20.114 --> 01:09:22.200
Jae-han gets to start flipping tiles.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:25.703
I lost.

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:35.129
Whatever Seok-hun tries next,
he can't win if Jae-han plays on defense.

01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:37.757
All Jae-han has to do is defend.

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.343
I felt so terrible,

01:09:41.302 --> 01:09:43.304
so I turned around
to look at my teammates.

01:09:44.597 --> 01:09:46.432
- Seriously...
- I feel you.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.019
What a shame.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.570
- Jae-han looks relaxed.
- I see it.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:00.905
He found his composure.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.074
He's smiling, even.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:12.375
If only I hadn't insisted
on hiding my color,

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.710
I could've found a better move

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.629
and kept the game going
until we were flipping tiles for a while.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:17.922
That filled me with regret.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.009
HWANG SEOK-HUN PLACES HIS 7TH TILE

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.470
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:32.562
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
got a bingo first.

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:37.734
I mostly felt terrible for my teammates.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.154
- Oh, dear.
- Poor guy.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.866
If only he hadn't gotten
so into the bluffing strategy.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.201
Oh, man...

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:55.501
I knew he'd pull it off.
I had a good feeling about this.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.004
- This is devastating.
- It's a bummer.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:02.884
Round 2 of Double-sided Bingo
ends in Team KAIST's victory.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.516
Both contestants,
please return to your places.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.393
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Don't be. You did great.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:13.311
Don't worry about it.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:15.688
I lost in the first place.
I'd never blame you.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.440
- It's all on me.
- Not at all.

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.861
My man, Jae-han!

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.404
Good job, both of you.

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:25.281
That was beautiful. Let me give you a hug.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.033
Come here.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.202
That was so cool.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:33.039
Now that I have tried it,
it had me thinking,

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.834
"I'm pretty good.
I can actually hold my ground."

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:38.336
The experience gave me confidence.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:41.380
I'll do my best moving forward.

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:43.800
If only the bluffing had worked.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:47.178
He should've at least avoided
using a tile with a yellow side.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.264
He was probably confident
about using yellow tiles

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:52.350
because he thought
he'd be flipping them first.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.894
The loss wasn't on Seok-hun.
Jae-han just had a better plan.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.604
Team KAIST identified the road to victory.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:59.023
It's a strategy-based victory.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:03.361
That concludes the Deathmatch,
Double-sided Bingo.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.196
The result will now be announced.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:08.199
The winning team is Team KAIST.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:20.253
The first team to be eliminated
from Elite League Season 3 is

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.338
Team POSTECH.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.635
It's nobody's fault but mine.

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.805
I almost had it, but I botched it.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:33.057
Don't beat yourself over it.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:41.065
Team POSTECH, please exit the grounds.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:42.900
Oh, man...

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.904
They're really leaving.

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.948
This isn't a survival show for nothing.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.538
I didn't get to say goodbye.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.418
I wanted to invite Jun-u for a meal.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.761
I can't believe I made it here.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:16.976
Initially, I had the daring dream
of outperforming the show's front-runners

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:20.229
and overthrowing
the established university ranks.

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.064
Everyone will see us as underdogs.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.316
We have to prove them wrong.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.611
We didn't perform well enough
to accomplish that.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.572
That fills me with regret.

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:31.991
I'll give you my energy.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.410
I'm grateful to my team
for accompanying me

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.912
on this short but meaningful journey.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.164
As a die-hard fan of Elite League...

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.416
He couldn't have rewatched it
more than I did.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.210
Tell them you have the lines memorized.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:44.962
I watched it like eight times.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:50.593
It was an honor to be
a part of the show, if only briefly.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.136
Thank you.

01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:54.305
There we go.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:59.602
Though it was for a brief period,
I'll cherish our time together

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:02.104
as a precious memory.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.815
The season's division setting
was a great opportunity

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:09.362
for me to demonstrate
that I chose not to go to medical school.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.696
It's a shame I couldn't.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.116
I hope our rivals in the division,
Team KAIST and Team SNU in STEM,

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.994
will beat all the med school teams
and become champions.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.013
The logo lamp went out.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:37.556
They turned white.

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.393
The strip lights now have a white glow.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.644
Hey, you're right.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.854
The colors look more harmonious this way.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.232
- All in a blueish shade, right?
- Exactly.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.316
All right.

01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:50.611
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP
What's our motto for the day?

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.823
We'll take first place today.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.074
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP
Shall we?

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.326
CHECKING THEIR REFLECTIONS

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.036
Looks like you have firm standards.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:00.621
Fit check!

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.206
Fit check!

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:03.124
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.543
Ji-u, you remind me of CHUU today.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.089
Not with that look, though.
When you smile.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.091
- I get it.
- You do, right?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.635
Don't agree to him, Jae-han.

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.595
It's just that I get why he said that.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.306
Come to think of it,
isn't CHUU's real name Ji-u?

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.767
CHUU'S REAL NAME IS ALSO KIM JI-U

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.020
I'm going to call you KAIST's TARZZAN.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:25.813
TARZZAN, A MEMBER OF ALLDAY PROJECT

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:29.525
I think you'll become famous
as KAIST's CHUU.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.277
KAIST's CHUU. KA-CHUU.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.945
- KA-CHUU.
- Just like Pikachu.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.196
"Pikachu."

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:37.491
"Pika-pika."

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.618
You're so annoying.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.288
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.248
Hey, something's inside.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.084
"Elite League Board Game."

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.086
We can play board games?

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.337
ELITE LEAGUE BOARD GAME

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:54.633
Can we play a variety of games
with that single set?

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.844
"Match and Mix,
Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors."

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:00.473
- Guys, there's "Signal Investigation"!
- Oh, that was my favorite.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.849
What's all this?

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:05.478
I wanted to try the old games.

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.855
It's a worthy investment.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:09.940
You can get four games out of it.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.859
This looks like fun.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.694
The dice
for Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors.

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:15.488
These cards are for Signal Investigation.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.866
- I wanted to play this.
- Me too.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.785
These cards are for Pixel Number.

01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:22.244
I like that game.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:26.165
My favorite is Signal Investigation.
It makes you feel like a detective.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.752
I want to keep one in my student club room
and play with the members.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:31.796
"This is the perk
of having a cast member as your friend."

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.547
- I want to get one.
- What happened?

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:34.632
Did you spill your coffee?

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.468
- I said I wanted to buy one.
- Sorry, I misheard that.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:41.764
I didn't mess up, okay?

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.141
I thought you followed
in Dong-jae's footsteps.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.312
WHILE WATCHING THE ACE MATCH,
PRIMALITY TEST

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:51.482
Are you okay?

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.692
THIS IS WHAT DONG-YEON MEANT
BY FOLLOWING IN DONG-JAE'S FOOTSTEPS

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.069
You must've been pretty nervous.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:58.614
Wait. No, I should be okay.
I doubt that will make the final cut.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.910
I thought someone spilled drinks again.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.912
I'd like to try the games
when this hits the market.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.164
- I'm going to buy it for real.
- Same here.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:10.084
I wonder what kind of game
they prepared today.

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:15.673
I wonder how the games will be affected
now that STEM Division is...

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.092
- Yes, it's 3 teams against 2 teams.
- ...missing a team.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.177
To avoid today's Deathmatch,

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:21.929
- our division has to...
- We must win.

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.264
That's for sure.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:25.391
I really hope
we beat Medical Division today.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.393
I want that so badly.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.436
Can you handle spatial awareness games?

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.813
How about games like Pixel Number?

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.274
I can handle any question
in under 30 seconds.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.193
I love it.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:37.403
We did calculations yesterday,

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:40.322
so our reasoning or memorization skills
will be tested today.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.615
Are you good with sequences?

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.576
- Of course, I am.
- What about you?

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.161
Why don't I quiz you on sequences?

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:49.039
TEAM YONSEI'S SEQUENCE EXERCISE

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.171
I see 9 times 9

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.463
and 9 times 7.

01:17:57.047 --> 01:17:58.883
That approach will take you a full day.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:02.553
I'll tell you the answer.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.472
- No, stop!
- Don't tell us just yet!

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.349
How dare you try to feed us answers?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:12.104
Wait, I see 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.106
- The next should be 64.
- So the answer is 4.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:18.402
A SEQUENCE LISTING POWERS OF 2
IN DOUBLE-DIGIT NUMBERS

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.653
It's actually 41.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:22.656
You're embarrassing us.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:29.663
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:33.083
- Here we go.
- The surviving teams are as follows.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:38.380
In Medical Division, Team SNU in Medicine,
Team Yonsei, and Team SKKU.

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:45.888
In STEM Division, Team SNU in STEM...

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.307
- Our survival is a given.
- Sure.

01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:51.227
...and Team KAIST.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.734
They're our polar opposite.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:18:59.985
I love Team KAIST's energy.

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.946
They're hyped up
after surviving the Deathmatch.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.197
They'd be super pumped.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.032
Team KAIST returns from hell.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.409
Shoot, my throat hurts.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:13.249
We intimidated the others,
but I took some damage in the process.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.294
Today's Ace Selection will test

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:20.047
your reasoning skills.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.423
Reasoning!

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:23.842
Just as you suggested.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.512
The keyword alone doesn't give us
any hints on the game.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.806
It's easy to guess the calculation games.

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:30.683
But this keyword itself
requires reasoning skills.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.519
Reasoning games
may involve numbers like...

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:34.979
Sequence-based questions?

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:37.481
It could be something basic
like identifying a sequence rule.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.275
Remember that game from Season 1

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:41.944
where a set of sentences stated
how many numbers were in it?

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:43.529
IN THIS SENTENCE,
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.863
OF THE DIGIT 1 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 2 IS X...

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.074
We may get a similar game today.

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:49.952
We may get a game using logical reasoning
like back in Season 1.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.955
TEAM SKKU IS MAKING THE SAME GUESS
AS TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:56.208
I think we'll get something
similar to that game.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.793
It's that or sequences.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:58.752
Are you good with that?

01:19:58.836 --> 01:19:59.878
- Sequences?
- Yes.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.381
When it comes to finding rules
like in past Elite League games,

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.633
I'm about as good as anyone.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.176
You're competing today, then.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.721
After all that grumbling,
he crushed yesterday's game.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:12.808
If he feels he's as good as anyone,
that means he has to compete today.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.643
And you, Pikachu.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.103
Go, Pikachu!

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.316
I get the feeling
you're good at reasoning.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:21.525
Logical reasoning?

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.193
It's about time you stepped up, Ji-u.

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.781
I think reasoning can be defined

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:32.661
as investigating various possible cases
to find one fitting answer.

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:34.621
You look especially smart today.

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:36.915
That's the vibe I'm going for.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.292
It's my concept for the day.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.377
I'm saving STEM Division from danger.

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:42.796
We're not in danger yet.
Why do you keep saying that?

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.840
Because my plan today
is to win the main match.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.925
When we win,
we'll be free from the dangers.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:49.053
My plan includes
Team Yonsei getting eliminated

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:51.055
after a Deathmatch with Team SKKU.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:54.099
Team Yonsei may get eliminated
after a face-off with the other Team SNU.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.518
Why do you both say
Team Yonsei will be gone?

01:20:57.728 --> 01:20:59.104
Why regard Team Yonsei as an underdog?

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:01.273
Team SKKU was so impressive yesterday.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.942
By the end of the season,

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.195
we'll have to compete
in games with 3 1-on-1 rounds.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:09.573
Since our strengths differ,
I want us to take turns to participate.

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:12.034
Why don't you compete today?
You said your strength was reasoning.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:13.577
All right.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:19.249
Reasoning and spatial awareness
are the areas I feel most confident in.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.753
Today's Ace Match was reasoning,
so I thought I had a good shot at it.

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:24.296
That's why I decided to compete.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.090
- Good luck.
- We'll do our best.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.841
You've got this.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.260
The time for strategy meeting is up.

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:33.972
The contestants
competing in the Ace Selection,

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.974
please gather in the Main Hall.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:40.687
TEAM SNU IN STEM
HAN JONG-YUN, SONG MYEONG-SU

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.064
Let's go.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.400
TEAM YONSEI
LEE YUN-BEOM, CHOI A-IN

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:47.069
TEAM SKKU
KIM DONG-YEON, LEE DONG-JAE

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.738
The rosters have changed
a lot from yesterday.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.116
One thing's for certain.
They're all yesterday's miners.

01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:54.451
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
KIM MIN-SEOK, JOO MIN-SEO

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:56.120
Every team sent their best miners.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:57.746
TEAM KAIST
KIM JAE-HAN, KIM JI-U

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.290
The second Ace Selection is...

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.629
Between the Numbers.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:08.424
"Between"?

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:10.300
Sequence, right?

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.844
In Between the Numbers,

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.012
your task is to place the numbers
in the empty slots

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.932
while satisfying all of the conditions.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.435
When you place numbers
in the example below,

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:23.522
there should be only 1 number
between the 2 instances of number 1.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:27.443
There should be 2 numbers
between the 2 instances of number 2.

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:31.405
Lastly, there should be 3 numbers
between the 2 instances of number 3.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.117
SAMPLE QUESTION: 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3
ANSWER: 3113

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.121
Hey, there was a similar game.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.331
Yes, it's just like Perfect Number.

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:45.669
Season 1 had a similar game
called Perfect Number.

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:50.132
I remembered solving it very quickly,
so that boosted my confidence.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:53.802
This was the type of game I excel at.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:57.973
I wanted to be my division's Ace player
and leave a strong impression.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.851
Jae-han's gotten more confident.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:01.894
I love seeing it.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:03.187
I trust you, Jae-han.

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.397
He's got a great sense of numbers.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:09.109
We will now begin the Ace Selection,
Between the Numbers.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.236
Here is your question.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:15.991
Just a second.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.659
BETWEEN 1 AND 1, THERE IS 1 NUMBER

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.161
BETWEEN 2 AND 2, THERE ARE 2 NUMBERS

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:20.829
BETWEEN 3 AND 3, THERE ARE 3 NUMBERS

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.122
BETWEEN 4 AND 4, THERE ARE 4 NUMBERS

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:23.415
BETWEEN 5 AND 5, THERE ARE 5 NUMBERS

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:24.666
BETWEEN 6 AND 6, THERE ARE 6 NUMBERS

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:25.876
BETWEEN 7 AND 7, THERE ARE 7 NUMBERS

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:29.463
That's tricky.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.347
It's difficult.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:47.773
We have to start from the condition
with the least possible cases.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:52.361
There were only a few spots
where we could use 7 or 5.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.531
I started shifting the sevens
to look for my answer.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:24:00.327
Now that I know where the 7s go,
I need to place the 5s.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.496
You should start with the sevens.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:04.581
Frankly, there aren't so many options.

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:07.918
The first 7 can only go
in the first 3 slots...

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:11.088
If the first number seven is placed
in the highlighted slot,

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.840
the next number seven has to go
in the next highlighted slot.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:16.510
But since six already occupies it,

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:20.556
the first number seven
can't be placed in this slot.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.517
As such, the first number seven
can only be placed

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.727
in one of the three colored slots.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.187
Using this method,

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:30.857
examine the possible cases
starting from the bigger numbers

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:34.152
to narrow down the options
and find the answer.

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:37.364
I think you've got to place
the bigger numbers first.

01:24:37.447 --> 01:24:40.075
It's best to keep
the smaller numbers until the end.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.661
There's no room for guesswork.
You must use logic all the way

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:45.205
to determine the slots
for numbers 7 and 5.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.125
Once you finish examining
all the possible cases,

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.544
you will see that those are the only slots
for numbers 5 and 7.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:01.638
But they can only use mental math.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.682
Right, they can't make notes.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:06.059
They can only type in the answer.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.186
Cracking all that in your mind
won't be so easy.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.398
It was very challenging

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:14.693
to count the squares by sight
without being able to take notes.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:18.780
Initially, I thought
this was a piece of cake.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.950
I realized it was more difficult
than I had thought.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.247
It's confusing to solve this
relying on your memory.

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:30.125
Please get it, guys.
Let's go, Team Yonsei.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:32.878
We'll secure the benefit,
win the main match,

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:36.131
and avoid the Deathmatch.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.391
Three...

01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:52.022
One contestant submitted

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:54.650
the correct answer
for Between the Numbers.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:55.859
Did someone solve it?

01:25:57.861 --> 01:25:59.863
You've got this, Jae-han and Ji-u.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.823
Medical Division's Ace player is...

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.080
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:13.168
- Yes, that's what I'm talking about!
- What's with A-in?

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.212
That's exactly what I wanted!

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.507
MEDICAL DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER:
TEAM YONSEI, CHOI A-IN

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.179
I placed second in the pre-test.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:26.973
I felt great
when I heard that I got it right.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:30.352
I concluded that reasoning
was my strength, just as I thought.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.064
I think I'll remember the answer
until my dying day.

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:37.275
- She's good.
- I see that.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.486
As expected
of a Sejong Science High valedictorian.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:40.737
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.323
Dong-jae believes Sang-yeon
is Team Yonsei's central figure.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:45.450
He does lead the group, actually.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.244
- He has the experience.
- Yes.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:50.622
I think Sang-yeon lacks flexibility.
But A-in is flexible.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:54.960
- Really?
- I actually see her as more of a threat.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.421
- We'll have to defeat her in the end.
- That's right.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:01.883
STEM DIVISION DOESN'T HAVE
AN ACE PLAYER YET

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.762
STEM people haven't solved it yet.

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:07.055
Yes, they're still working on it.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:07.973
We crushed them.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.558
- It's a landslide.
- For sure.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:12.394
- I'm sending a mental message.
- They wouldn't remember it, though.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.938
- Three, seven...
- They'd go, "Come again"?

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:16.523
I wonder who'll get it first.

01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:18.024
I want our guys to show our strength.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:21.486
My gut says Jong-yun will do that.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.287
STEM Division's Ace player is...

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.748
STEM DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:33.915
...Team SNU's...

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:36.168
Oh, shoot.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.631
...Song Myeong-su.

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.593
- All right.
- Great.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.219
STEM DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER:
TEAM SNU IN STEM, SONG MYEONG-SU

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:49.598
Logical reasoning
has always been one of my strengths.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:53.810
I thought that if I could keep it up,
I could secure the benefit as well.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:55.854
Here's your answer.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.859
That concludes the Ace Selection.

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:03.487
Good luck on the Ace Match.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.198
I'll get us the benefit.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.742
I ranked higher than Myeong-su
in the pre-test,

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.285
and I noticed how long it took him.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:14.664
I felt good about my chances
of defeating him in the Ace Match.

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:18.126
The pre-test and the games
were entirely different matters.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.420
I wasn't worried. I felt pretty confident.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.800
We will now begin the Ace Match,
Three-way Divide.

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:26.760
The game involves the Korean alphabet.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:28.386
Man, that looks like a blast!

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.764
That's an inhuman speed. It's outrageous.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.308
Team SNU's Song Myeong-su.

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:36.019
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.729
I never fall apart.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:40.148
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:41.274
That is correct.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.776
Way to go, A-in!

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:44.277
Today's main match is...

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:47.239
Exit Strategy 3.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.406
What does the hunter do?

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:49.491
Can they remove a piece?

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:50.826
Let's take this.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.118
This is a sure way to win.

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:53.370
We don't need to get intimidated.

01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:55.372
This will be our main battleground.

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.707
We achieved our goal,
and they took the bait.

01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:42.419
