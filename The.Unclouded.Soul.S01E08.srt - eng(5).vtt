[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.710
[Episode 8]

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.130
Don't move.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.560
Can I move now?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.150
How much money would it take

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.600
to buy your smile?

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.800
To smile only for me?

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.530
I got it.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.060
What filth is this?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.640
What filthy thing is this?

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.010
What I need is

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.660
human blood.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.150
I need virgin blood.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.290
Go find it for me!

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.240
You!

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.580
Did you hear me?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.980
The city gates are sealed now.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.880
The Feiyu Guard
is keeping watch there every day.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.870
Let me tell you.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.990
If I weren't waiting for Yunyi to return,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.140
I couldn't hold on anymore, you know?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.760
Do you hear me?

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.190
Honey.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.490
Our Qionghua Sect still needs me now.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.430
We must eliminate evil spirits

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.680
and uphold justice,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.280
have you forgotten all that?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.160
Eliminate evil spirits...

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.630
Yeah.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.860
Then what do I see before me?

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.659
[Yunlai Inn]

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.680
What are you thinking about?

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.870
Madam Jin?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.190
Miss Xiao Yao,
I know I'm being presumptuous,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.240
but I'm desperate about my daughter,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.900
and I hope you can understand.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.640
Could I ask you to guide me?

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.290
I want to find Yunyi and bring her back.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.310
Please come in.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.240
Sit.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.840
All right.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.600
Thank you.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.840
Madam, you must still not trust me yet.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.680
Please don't misunderstand, miss.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.160
I've always trusted you.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.070
It's just that

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.310
our Qionghua Sect

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.720
has many matters to attend to,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.480
and we plan to leave Pingjiang soon.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.410
Even though
Yunyi's eyes are being treated,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.090
you can't wait any longer?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.120
Yunyi has been blind since childhood.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.000
Her father and I

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.950
sought famous doctors everywhere
to treat her,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.280
but saw no improvement.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.990
Perhaps it's not an illness,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.680
but fate.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.180
Madam, what happened here?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.440
Perhaps it was the cat.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.020
Yes, it was the cat.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.670
You look haggard today.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.780
Did you not rest well last night?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.190
I heard that Qionghua Sect disciples

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.320
were patrolling with the Feiyu Guard,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.190
and encountered a great demon last night,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.120
disturbing you.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.920
Last night,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.610
there was nothing unusual.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.750
Perhaps

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.159
I was too worried about my daughter
and didn't sleep well.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:40.669
Indeed.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.600
Without seeing Yunyi with your own eyes,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.400
as her mother,
naturally you can't sleep soundly.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.730
I might as well—

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.330
so I won't be accused
of being an accomplice.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.910
I'll take you to see her later.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.100
-Okay.
-But Madam,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.550
I drank too much last night.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.080
I need some time to prepare.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.510
Why don't you go back and rest first?

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.630
In an hour,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.720
let's meet at the entrance of the inn.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.380
No problem.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.150
It seems Flower Lady misses Yunyi too.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.500
Look, she's so anxious she's scratching.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.320
Stay here, miss. See you later.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.920
All right.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.710
Good morning.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.690
I was just about to look for you.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.220
What's wrong with you?

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.650
I'm smiling.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.920
Why are you smiling?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.230
How much money would it take

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.870
to buy your smile?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.870
To smile only for me?

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.350
It's nothing.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.280
What did you want to see me about?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.410
The real culprit is likely to appear soon.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.750
Li.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.670
Li.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.550
I think I can see you now,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.320
but I still can't see you clearly.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.610
With more time,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.160
you'll see clearly.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.130
Mm-hmm.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.510
I'm not in a hurry.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.580
I've waited so many years already.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.510
Li,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.870
when I can

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.120
finally see clearly,

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.680
will I be shocked?

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.350
Will Dad and Mom

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.370
be different from what I imagined?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.970
But

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.800
you must be exactly

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.070
like what I've imagined—

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.330
incredibly handsome.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.430
I'm very ugly.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.240
You're so good to me.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.990
Even if you're truly ugly,
it doesn't matter.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.910
My disciples.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.740
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.510
It's time again for us disciples
of Qionghua Sect

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.710
to eliminate evil for the people.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.110
Miss Xiao Yao.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.140
I'm sorry.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.480
I originally thought

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.510
just the two of us

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.360
could quietly bring Yunyi back.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.160
But unexpectedly,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.040
my husband found out about it

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.180
and now it has become

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.120
this grand spectacle.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.670
It's all right.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.790
If Yunyi knew so many people
were going to get her,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.120
she would be very happy.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.020
We must eliminate all demons!

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.150
We are

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.050
duty-bound to do so!

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.870
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.910
Yunyi,

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.670
your parents are here to see you.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.310
Yunyi, it's Mother!

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.660
If you hear my voice, please come out.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.330
Lead the way.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.410
I would like to kindly remind you

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.070
this fog can affect your mind.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.610
If your willpower is weak,

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.140
you might even take your own life.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.120
Sect Leader and I will go in first.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.290
The rest of you wait here.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.690
We'll call if we need you.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.390
Master, Mistress, be careful!

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.850
Please lead the way, miss.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.520
Miss Xiao Yao.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.270
Miss Xiao Yao.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.720
Muqing!

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.950
Why have you trapped my soul?

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.560
You demon...

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.240
You hypocritical murderer.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.370
Give me back my life!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.600
Why have you trapped my soul?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.370
You demon.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.000
You hypocritical murderer!

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.200
Give me back my life!

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.020
Why have you trapped my soul?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.740
You demon!

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.690
You hypocritical murderer!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.090
Give me back my life!

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.080
Give me back my life!

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.820
Murderer!

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.730
Give me back my life!

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.600
You hypocritical murderer!

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.760
Give me back my life!

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.030
Give me back my life!

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080
Give me back my life!

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.290
Give me back my life!

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.480
Give me back my life!

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.240
Give me back my life!

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.760
Murderer!

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.120
Give me back my life!

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.270
Give me back my life!

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.210
Impossible!

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.650
Impossible...

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.170
Impossible!

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.300
You're all already dead.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.160
These are just my illusions!

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.000
Impossible!

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.190
Give me back my life!
Give me back my life!

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.360
Give my life back!

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.750
Return my life now!

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.050
Demon!

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.280
Your true colors are revealed.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.960
You pose as a celestial cultivator,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.590
yet blame all your evil deeds

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.870
on demons.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.920
Today, I, a demon,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.710
am ridding humans of a menace.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.460
Wait!

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.810
Let's tie him up
and hand him over to the Feiyu Guard.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.210
Must I follow human rules

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.830
when upholding justice?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.310
Please show mercy!

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.240
Madam Jin?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.910
He acts righteous by day,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.320
but kills and drinks blood by night.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.150
With such evil deeds,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.410
you still protect him?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.600
Muqing became like this

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.750
because of me.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.360
When Muqing first joined Qionghua Sect,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.090
his talent wasn't remarkable.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.200
His cultivation

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.920
was rather slow too.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.180
But among all disciples,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.510
he was the most diligent

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.550
and kindest to me.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.440
I had a heart condition since childhood.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.970
He often practiced with me,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.510
helped ease my pain,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.400
and even transferred his energy to me.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.850
Under his attentive care,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.170
my health gradually improved.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.500
My father saw his sincerity toward me

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.370
and gave me to him in marriage.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.470
On our wedding night,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.960
I finally learned the truth.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.790
Hubby?

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.740
Hubby?

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.560
Honey, be quiet.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.620
Don't be afraid. It's me.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.680
Don't be scared!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.150
Honey.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.600
Don't come any closer!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.120
Honey.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.860
Stay back!

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:18.860
Don't be afraid.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.910
Honey, don't scream.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.420
Listen to me.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.390
It's me.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.670
Don't be afraid.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.410
Don't be afraid.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.080
I lost control of my cultivation

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.520
and my mind...

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.390
my mind went astray

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.910
to find a cure for you.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.320
Believe me.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.370
I never wanted to kill people
and drink blood.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.980
Honey, I have a Soul-binding Spell.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.590
I have a Soul-binding Spell!

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.750
You...

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.200
just stay there and talk.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360
All right.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.140
Lower your voice.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:50.960
Honey.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.320
Once I use the Soul-binding Spell,

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.710
they won't find the bodies, Honey.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.480
Trust me.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Qionghua Sect

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.349
is an orthodox immortal sect

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.680
meant to eliminate evil spirits

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.260
and protect the people.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.790
Look at what you've become.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.550
How will you

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.480
reconcile with yourself in the future?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.000
Are you suggesting

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.660
I should turn myself in to the authorities

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.160
or lose all my powers

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.030
and die in agony?

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.750
Honey.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.360
I truly don't want to kill anyone.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.900
I promise you,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.030
unless absolutely necessary,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.400
I won't kill

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.020
or drink blood!

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.070
Honey.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.700
I truly wanted to save your life.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.440
Rest assured,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.590
I will help these souls find peace

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.850
and reenter the cycle of reincarnation.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.590
Believe me.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.330
I didn't mean to do it.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.020
I didn't mean to do it.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.040
I never meant for this to happen.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.490
After that,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.000
we traveled everywhere with our disciples.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.640
We claimed to be hunting demons,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.370
but in truth,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.750
we were searching for the Yuli Spring.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.510
I know my sins are grave.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.080
I've thought
about ending my life with him.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.880
But then

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.780
Yunyi came into our lives,

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.860
and I couldn't let go anymore.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.510
Yunyi was born blind.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.450
Isn't that a form of retribution?

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.750
But what fault is it of Yunyi's?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.160
So all these years,

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.660
wherever we went,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720
I prayed at every temple.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.050
I just wanted to pray...

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.490
pray...

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.730
for my sins to be lightened.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.350
[Temple of Eternal Life]

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.720
I am burdened with sin.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.830
I beg the Bodhisattva for forgiveness.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.640
I vow to be vegetarian for life,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.510
to guide and save others,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.980
only asking to help the deceased
find peace

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.780
and receive their forgiveness.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.870
May my daughter grow up safely

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.210
and not bear the burden
of her parents' sins.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.310
Have you ever saved a man with a scar

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.540
in a Bodhisattva Temple
on Qingyuan Mountain?

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.040
I didn't save him.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.920
He ate the offerings

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.050
and thus planted good karma.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.920
A mountain elf that is
neither human nor demon

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.790
practices medicine to help others,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.250
yet is despised by people.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.120
The Sect Leader of Qionghua Sect

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.650
has gone astray in cultivation,

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.250
yet is revered by all.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.210
That's what the human realm is like.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.070
Go to sleep.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.590
When you wake up,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.430
your eyes will be able to see.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.590
I can't fall asleep.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.540
Why don't you tell me another story?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.480
I only have a few stories

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.070
and I've told them all already.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.040
I don't care.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.620
Tell me another one.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.410
You can make up a new one.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.850
Once upon a time,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.920
there was a butcher and a monk

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.200
who were good friends.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.450
They woke each other up every morning.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.900
But after they died,

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.200
the butcher went to heaven

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.360
while the monk went to hell.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.380
Because the butcher
did good deeds every day

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.310
by waking the monk to chant sutras.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.510
While the monk woke the butcher every day

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.440
only for him to take lives.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.240
Master.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.310
Master.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.910
Have you found Junior?

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.510
Master.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.510
Master!

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.960
Master!

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.100
Master!

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.200
It's over.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.570
It has finally come.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.370
I beg the Demon King not to interfere.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.010
I will end this myself.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.700
Leave my Qionghua Sect

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.950
with its last bit of dignity.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920
Miss Xiao Yao.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.630
In the future,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.000
if you...

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.350
ever see Yunyi again,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.350
please tell her

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.030
that her parents

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.720
died hunting demons.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.550
I'm sorry

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.110
you were

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.440
wrongfully accused.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.880
Please.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.610
Don't worry, Madam.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.760
Keep your voice down.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.930
Yunyi is asleep.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.920
We found the killer.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.260
It was Yunyi's father,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.310
Jin Muqing.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.160
Yunyi's mother

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.310
once at

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.550
the Bodhisattva Temple
on Qingyuan Mountain

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.150
helped guide a fated person.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.970
She guided many others too.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.760
But she could never redeem
her husband's sins.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.170
Your sins have been redeemed.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.200
That was their own karma—

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.930
It was Jin Muqing's evil deeds.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.190
Madam should never have had
to pay for them.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.860
When Yunyi's eyes open again,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.510
please give her

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.980
a clear world.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.070
Don't let her see

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.090
the suffering of the human realm again.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.470
Let him go.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.900
He wants to protect the person
he cares about most.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.680
Qionghua Sect
has betrayed its own principles

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.720
and harmed innocent people.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.450
The truth has now come to light.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.910
Surrender now!

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.620
Senior.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.070
Senior.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.270
Honey.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.000
Tell them

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.920
I didn't kill anyone.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.860
I'm innocent.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.890
I didn't commit those murders.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.720
I didn't kill anyone!

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.070
You didn't kill them.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.220
Tell them quickly.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.680
Quick...

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680
I'm sorry.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.750
I

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.500
am truly exhausted.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.820
Senior, do you remember

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.580
when we got married,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.390
we promised Father

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.730
to uphold justice for life

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.420
and restore our sect's glory?

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.400
I remember you once said

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.000
you wanted to find a place
with beautiful nature with me

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.530
where we could
live like immortals together.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.170
Don't be afraid.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.860
Our wish is about to come true.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.510
Madam Jin!

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.610
Why?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.900
Have you kept the promise

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.820
you made to me all these years?

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.610
I haven't harmed anyone since.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.160
Very good.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:04.880

Congratulations, My Lord,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.350
for leading the Feiyu Guard
to eliminate this great demon.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.880
The court will surely
reward you generously.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.110
The Qionghua Master
was severely poisoned,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.030
and both he and his wife have perished.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.160
If there's a reward,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.480
we should get the lion's share,
shouldn't we?

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.310
Yes, indeed.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.340
You...

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.000
You Qionghua Sect members
are completely twisting the facts

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.110
and have no shame!

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.110
You're the ones
who forgo honor for profit.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.070
The credit belongs to us Feiyu Guards.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.670
Isn't that right, brothers?

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.630
Li?

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.160
Li?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.290
Li?

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.270
This is what happens
when you don't cultivate properly.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.000
You end up in human hands,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.930
becoming nothing but a plaything.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.910
I think it looks quite happy though.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.510
Yes,

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.200
I think so too.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.920
Master, I'd like to ask...

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.790
In this world,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.590
there are many more girls like you

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.250
who need Li's healing.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.080
If you miss him,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.020
use the eyes he gave you

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.710
to see all things in this world.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.110
He would surely be happy.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.390
But we agreed to see it together.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.030
How could he break his promise?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.640
Because

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.240
he had a more important vow

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.600
to keep.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.460
Can someone keep Flower Lady in check?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.270
What are you doing,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.000
hugging and biting me all over?

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.040
Coming.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.750
She was quite obedient.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.790
Obedient?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.100
Let me tell you something.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.880
When we cultivate...

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.280
What is this?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.120
This is a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.310
When all eight pieces are gathered,

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.610
it will open the path
to Penglang Celestial Mountain

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.140
and lead to the Yuli Spring.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.700
How did it end up here?

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.080
The fragments of the Kunlun Mirror

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.340
are formed from emotional attachments.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.820
The eight pieces represent
life's eight sufferings.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.620
This particular piece is called

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.530
"Lasting Resentment."

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.150
Birth, aging, sickness, death.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.830
Separation from the beloved.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.030
Lasting resentment.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.660
Unfulfilled desires.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.400
Inability to let go.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.510
Mortals

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.010
always chase elusive immortality,

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.040
yet overlook the happiness
right before them.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.320
Come in.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.159
Why are you here?

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.900
This jade pendant,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.730
take it with you.

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.780
Whenever you call,

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.400
I will surely appear.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.070
Thank you.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.850
But no need.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.120
I've been through a lot recently

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.760
and my mind has become much clearer.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
I've realized

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.820
that I must rely on myself

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.720
and not always depend on others.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.000
Even if it's me?

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.810
Even you.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.040
To others,

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.470
I am the Monarch of All Demons,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.920
but to you,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.590
I am just your Hong Ye,

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.500
your eternal support.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.490
Before,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.890
I was wrong.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.350
Let's not mention the past anymore.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.920
What I want is

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.800
to have at least the same level of magic

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.130
as Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.760
Though not as powerful as you—
the strongest in the world—

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.160
but when facing threats,

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.920
I could at least defend myself.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.710
Strong enough to survive

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.070
Hei Wu and Bingzhu,

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.670
while protecting
Dali, Luoluo and the others.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:20.960
Also,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.230
I don't want

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.380
you to be in danger
because of me in the future.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.130
I don't mind,

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.960
no matter how difficult it gets.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.890
All right, I need to go to class now.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.710
That's not right.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.280
What's going on?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.800
Let me do it.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.510
You do it.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.110
You didn't recite the incantation.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:53.920
Didn't I?

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.630
Let's do it together. Let's charge at it.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.430
Ready, begin.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.660
Transform!

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.460
It's not working. Could it be the leaf?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.360
This one looks like it.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.030
Let's try this one.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.550
No.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.150
To have survived
the Demons' Valley disaster—

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.360
you owe your lives

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.280
to the protection

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.070
of countless ancestors.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.360
The humans have retreated for now,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.760
but if they attack again,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.630
with your current power and skills,

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.830
will you be able to protect yourselves?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.680
From today onwards,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.270
classes in Demons' Valley will resume.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.340
The assessments
will also become extremely rigorous.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.200
Everyone must remember:

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840
you must master lethal techniques,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.460
and know sly tricks

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.480
as well.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:48.590
He looks exactly like him!

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.960
Even the clothes are the same.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.230
To subdue humans,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.450
besides absolute power,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.940
you must also manipulate their desires.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.360
And human desires

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.630
are nothing but money,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.760
power,

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.280
and appearances.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.850
Humans are driven by their desires.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.070
Humans

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.230
are nothing but slaves

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.230
to their desires.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.440
It's fake.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.730
If you want humans to obey,

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.090
just give them what they want.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.840
The more they want,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.960
the more willingly

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.450
they'll put their lives in your hands.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.690
Don't be afraid.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.430
Pair up.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.330
Use the hair collected

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.150
during your human realm test for practice.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.590
This is good.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.430
Those who fail to transform today

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.810
will stay after class.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280
Detention again.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.360
So annoying.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.970
Actually,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.860
humans don't live

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.190
solely for power, money,

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.180
and appearances.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.790
For many humans,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.320
these things are far less important
than family and friends.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.940
Yeah.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.320
If we want to understand humans,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.780
we shouldn't generalize.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.470
Actually, humans are like demons,

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.570
they also have emotions and love.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.270
Emotions and love?

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.590
Those are just the most despicable means

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.720
humans use to disrupt our demon realm.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.930
Among the humans we've met,

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.040
how many showed genuine feelings?

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.480
Right.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.470
Is it the hypocritical Qionghua Sect,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.530
or the Feiyu Guard
who plundered Demons' Valley?

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.440
Only enemies

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.900
can see their enemies' weaknesses clearly.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.320
-Xiao Yao...
-Stop talking about this.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.070
She has stayed
in the human realm for too long

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.930
and has been bewitched by humans.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.000
She is punished to copy

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.880
the "Records of Despicable Human Tactics"
10 times after class

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.960
to wake herself up.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.510
But...

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.480
Pair up.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.750
Come get hair samples from me,

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.480
and start practicing immediately.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.640
I'll go first.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.030
Here I come.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.710
Luoluo!

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.370
Your nose is completely gone.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.710
My turn.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.230
I look quite handsome, don't I?

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.900
Yes! You're still attractive as a man.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.240
Poor.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.030
Why?

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.590
I transformed quite well.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.480
-Yeah.
-How can we be Poor?

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.940
-It was good.
-Next group.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:40:59.960
Let me try!

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.360
Wasn't it pretty good?

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:01.840
It was.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.550
This didn't disappear.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.950
Why did you get Poor then?

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960
I couldn't speak.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.190
The Prefect's daughter.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.480
So this is what it feels like
to be fleshy.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.340
I did it!

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.910
Tiger, you're so good.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.380
Tiger's tail.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.320
Very Poor.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.190
Keep practicing.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.290
Why didn't you hide yourself?

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.180
This kind of
Feiyu Guard isn't scary at all.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.590
I'm dying of laughter.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.320
Is it funny?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.460
Yes, it is.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.290
Transform.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.470
Come on!

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.070
Looks exactly like him.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:15.940
Amazing!
