MEDICAL DIVISION
DEATHMATCH

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.565
One of those lamps will be off tomorrow.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.234
Oh, man. If we had to be there now...

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.271
You'd hate to be there, right?

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.276
This is just a chapter
in our epic journey.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.210
Of course.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.713
Be it in the Deathmatch or the main match,
the winner will advance.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.849
- Let's just have fun.
- All right.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.884
The ones having fun will win.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.120
I don't think we'll lose.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.521
- Me neither.
- We'll do fine.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.423
We're not going to lose. Just look at us.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.559
They don't stand a chance against us.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.362
Do you want to compete
if we get a one-on-one game?

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.899
It depends.
If it tests memorization, I'll handle it.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:11.271
Please gather outside your base camps
for the Deathmatch.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.674
- Let's go.
- Shall we do a chant?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.443
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.946
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.847
- Akaraka!
- Akaraka!

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.549
- Let's go, Yonsei!
- Let's go, Yonsei!

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.117
DISAPPOINTED

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.787
- Let's go, Yonsei!
- Let's go, Yonsei!

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.555
They're not in sync at all.

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.390
That was freaking hilarious.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.428
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.232
We will now begin today's Deathmatch.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.803
The two high-ranking teams will survive,

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:46.740
while the lowest-ranking team
will be eliminated immediately.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.443
It finally feels like I'm on Elite League.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.178
- Finally feeling nervous?
- Yeah.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.614
This is the thrill I've been waiting for.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.349
I have faith in us.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.584
- Same here.
- Good.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.253
I can't wait to see who'll go home.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.256
I ran into Sang-yeon in the men's room,
and he looked mad.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.258
He must be very competitive.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.362
I bet Sang-yeon is out for blood.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:14.301
"Anyone who messes with my team
will be sent home."

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.737
That was my resolve going in.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:18.438
Today's Deathmatch is...

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.511
Mystery Poker.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:27.848
We're playing poker?

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.183
- Poker?
- I've been dying to play poker.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.485
You any good with poker?

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.453
- I'm pretty good.
- Really?

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.857
What's the mystery element?

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.793
Do you think
they'll be given sequence quizzes?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.662
For Mystery Poker,

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.931
you will study the submitted cards
and the winning hand

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:51.004
to identify the rule for victory.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.873
They won't know the rule at first?

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.841
No, their task is to deduce it.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.777
We must figure out the rule.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:57.678
Rules?

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:00.380
It's a reasoning game.
Guys, I've got this.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.050
Once the game begins,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.986
each team will receive 2 sets of 9 cards.

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:06.987
REUSABLE AT EACH TURN

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:09.423
1-MINUTE DEADLINE
After deciding on the order,

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.159
all teams will take turns
to submit a pair of cards.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.830
Then, the host will make
the fourth and last submission.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.900
Each round has
a predetermined rule for victory,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.169
which will remain a mystery.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.504
After the four submissions are made,

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.040
the mystery rule will be applied.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.510
Then, the winning hand of that turn
will be announced.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.547
As the round progresses,

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:38.151
you must deduce the rule for victory
from the accumulated data.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:43.223
In the case of the example on screen,
the hand with the largest sum wins.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.859
Just the winner and nothing more?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.394
How do we deduce the rule?

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.628
That's rough.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.933
After the winning hand is announced,
you will be given two minutes.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.470
You can submit your answer
any time during this window.

00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.007
They can use the two minutes
to deduce the correct answer,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.543
or select the cards to submit
on the next turn.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.049
The submitted answers
will not be shared with your competitors.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.653
While there is no limit
on the answer submissions,

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.622
a wrong answer triggers a penalty,

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:20.560
banning your team from submitting answers
for the next two turns.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.628
How cruel.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.498
Just 1 turn can be critical,
but they're banned for 2 turns?

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.467
Whether you decide
to take a guess after the first turn

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.103
or only after the second turn
can make a world of difference.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.305
A wrong answer costs you two submissions.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:38.044
Out of a total of 5 rounds,
the first team to win 2 rounds survives.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.747
They will be relieved
from the Deathmatch immediately.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.750
The remaining two teams will continue,

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:47.687
until one of them wins two rounds first
and secures their survival.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.357
Win two points first, and you're safe.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:54.494
How would their strategy meetings go?
Would they brainstorm for bizarre rules?

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.997
The most creative team would win.

00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.600
The card selections can't get you so far
because those are shared.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.135
It's all about creativity.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.905
I hope Ji-hu's team survives.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.607
- To take him down yourself?
- Of course.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.442
I chose him as my nemesis.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.678
The rules will be pretty complex.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.382
We can't pinpoint the rule
simply based on one winning hand.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.284
I think we've got this.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.319
- It doesn't seem so daunting.
- No.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.921
We're wiz with numbers.

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.691
All teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:28.028
You'll be given 20 minutes.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.564
All right. I feel pretty good about this.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.670
I think the cards we submit
will play an important role, Sang-yeon.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:39.206
What if we get to go first early on?

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.975
Shall we hand in 1-1 in that case?

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.844
- Let's go with 1-1.
- You want 1-1?

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.745
Yes, then they can't learn anything.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.515
We should think about the cards to submit

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:50.383
- when we go last.
- Definitely.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.753
Which hand would give the others
as little information as possible?

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.422
We should check their hands first.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.992
Let's not worry about others
getting ideas from our submission.

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.961
We'll prioritize finding answers.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.397
- Let's submit a pair we're curious about.
- At the end of the day,

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.867
- we can get ahead if they get wrong.
- Exactly.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.035
- If they don't, that can't be helped.
- Right.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:13.340
The others might not catch on
even if we openly carried out our plan.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.542
So we decided against limiting our options

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:20.013
in consideration of our competitors.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.083
- I doubt the rounds will go on for long.
- Really?

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.218
- Will we find the rule soon?
- I think so.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:29.189
I think the first few rounds
will have an easy rule.

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:32.459
Our best bet is to score two points
and get the heck out quickly.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.527
Okay, any ideas on the rules?

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.730
- Are you ready to share?
- Give me a minute.

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:38.732
Simple operations?

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.067
Division? No, let's go with remainders.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.869
- Hey, that could work.
- Right?

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.572
I think there's a high chance
a remainder will pop up.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.074
What are the possibilities
apart from the four operations?

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.377
Here's an idea.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.279
"Take the cards as a double-digit number.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.582
Multiply the ones place by three.
Which hand has the largest result?"

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:57.817
That's a possibility.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.021
Would they ask us to convert the numbers
using the binary system?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.423
"How many ones does it have
after the conversion?"

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.261
- You never know, so I'll write it down.
- Please do. Let's not take any chances.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.199
"How many primes are there
between the numbers AB and BA?"

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.235
COUNT THE PRIMES
BETWEEN THE NUMBERS AB AND BA

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:16.603
That's a possibility.

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:19.272
Here's my approach.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:20.840
If one of them submits 1-6,

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.376
we can submit 6-1 to see
if the mirror version also wins.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.445
Yes, I think that's worth trying.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:27.380
It works for us
if both hands turn out to be winners.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:33.520
Symmetric pairs such as 1-6 and 6-1

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.291
may get the same results
depending on the rule for victory.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:42.395
For example, if the rule for victory
uses multiplication of two numbers,

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:47.667
the hands 1-6 and 6-1
both yield an identical result of six.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.936
Now, consider the case

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:53.406
where the rule asks you to divide
the first number by the second one.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.343
The two hands
would then have different results.

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:59.346
Since this is the case,
submitting symmetrical pairs

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:03.717
can give you an important lead
in identifying the rule for victory.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.287
How's this? Let's say we think
it's the number of factors.

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:11.858
Since we have that general idea,
we'll have our answer sheet ready.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.626
Then, we can submit 7-2.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.862
Since 72 is 2 to the third power
times 3 to the second power,

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.731
- it has a lot of factors.
- Right.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.599
We can submit the most likely set to win.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.369
Once we learn it won,
we can go ahead and...

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.871
We'll hit the buzzer
and submit the answer sheet.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.574
Ready to crush this, guys?

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.042
I know I'm up for it.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:32.712
The word "poker" made me uneasy,
but the rules restored my confidence.

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:36.216
This will be fun.
I'm pretty psyched already.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:37.917
I've been waiting for a game like this.

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:41.388
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:48.395
It makes no sense for Team SNU Medicine
to be eliminated so early.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:52.532
I was set on teaching them a lesson.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.701
This is our playground.

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.603
We'll enjoy this. It's a fun game.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.338
You can say that again.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.741
If Team SKKU goes home,
we'll be in a better position.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:04.411
- They have strong players.
- Exactly.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.312
They left an impression on Day 1.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.782
Ji-hu even won the Ace Match.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.518
All three teams will now throw a die.

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:14.587
The team with the largest number
will decide the order first.

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:20.593
Team SNU in Medicine
has the largest number.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.196
- Shall we go last?
- Okay.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:24.364
We'll go third.

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.633
Team SNU in Medicine will go third.

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.602
We'll go second.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.404
Team SKKU will go second.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:34.774
That leaves Team Yonsei to go first.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.111
- It's not bad.
- We can leave the Deathmatch first, too.

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.114
Let us begin the first turn of Round 1.

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:42.949
- Team Yonsei will go first.
- I'll follow the plan.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.951
Please show us your cards.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.458
THEY PRESENT 1-1 AS PLANNED

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:54.627
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:56.930
Should we make it hard for them?

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.399
We can spice things up
with two large numbers.

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.367
Two large numbers? How's 8-9?

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.402
I like that.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.675
Team SKKU's hand is 8-9.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.010
They went with 8-9 and 1-1.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.580
Shall we try 9-8?

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:18.585
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-8.

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.253
My hand is...

00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:22.455
Which cards will he present?

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.425
My hand is 2-4.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.396
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.166
I hope it's either 8-9 or 9-8.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.335
Here is the result of the turn.

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:36.769
The winning hand is 9-8.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:39.772
The bigger the better?

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.942
- Looks that way.
- You will now be given two minutes.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.311
We had 8-9 and 9-8, but only 9-8 won.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.180
- So symmetry's not involved.
- Exactly.

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:50.283
Try A minus B.
The one with the largest result is 9-8.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.118
Guys, listen.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.121
- A minus B may be our rule.
- Let's keep our voices low.

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:58.591
- Isn't it too simple, though?
- Still, keep this in mind.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:00.793
They have too little to work with.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.196
Yes, it's impossible
to guess at this point.

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.864
What can they do with that?

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:06.699
Guys, look.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:10.270
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN A IS DIVIDED BY B

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.172
Want to give it a try?

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:14.140
You want to submit an answer now?

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:15.675
What?

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.544
Let's wait for one more turn.

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.647
If we're wrong in the next turn,
we can only submit at the fifth turn.

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:24.083
But if our answer is wrong now,
we can submit again on the fourth turn.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:27.554
Honestly, this is a pretty good guess.
Let's roll with it.

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:29.889
What if we get a major clue
in the next turn?

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.491
Let's still try our luck.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.362
Winning points early on
was critical in this game.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:38.731
I thought it didn't make a difference
whether we used two turns

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:41.768
in testing our theory
or waiting for the penalty to expire.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:46.072
That's why I decided to submit an answer
when I felt it had an 80-90% shot.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.474
He up and did it.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.376
- What?
- He made a submission.

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.745
The game does have an element of poker

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.582
because you need a nerve of steel
to make such a move.

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:58.952
Okay, then. Let's wait it out
until after the third turn.

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:00.687
- We have so many options
- Right.

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.790
like the largest remainder
when AB is divided by nine.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.425
When it is divided by 11, too.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:06.359
TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.928
- It's too early to tell.
- This works as well.

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.097
But a wrong answer costs them two turns.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.866
The odds of getting a conclusive lead
during that time are slim.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.236
Anyhow, he's incredibly bold.
I can't believe it.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.571
Team Yonsei.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:22.275
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN A IS DIVIDED BY B

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.347
Team Yonsei.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.514
That is incorrect.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:34.921
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:36.256
That is incorrect.

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:38.825
- Good.
- They can't do anything for two turns.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.827
Attitude definitely matters here.

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:44.297
- If it had been right...
- It would've been legendary.

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:46.933
The two-turn penalty seems heftier
than I initially thought.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.268
Totally.

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.937
It'd be better to get it right
on the first try.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.172
Let us begin the second turn of Round 1.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.475
Let's target the sum of factors.

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:56.709
A FACTOR DIVIDES ANOTHER NUMBER EXACTLY

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.545
A number with more factors
will probably give us more information.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.447
- This is the sum of 72's factors.
- How's 7-2?

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:02.982
OPTS FOR A HAND
WITH THE LARGEST SUM OF FACTORS

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:06.486
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:07.587
SUM OF FACTORS: 195

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.992
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-3.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.461
All right, then.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.430
Let's go with 7-1.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.933
- No, let's complicate things a bit.
- Team Yonsei?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.468
We'll go with 8-4.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:27.473
Team Yonsei's hand is 8-4.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.175
Check the factors of 84.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.476
What's their sum?

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:31.678
CALCULATING THE SUM OF 84'S FACTORS

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:32.612
- Isn't it 224?
- Yes.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:34.580
They must be thinking
along the same lines as us.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.283
That totals 224,
so their hand's sum outnumbers ours.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.484
BELIEVES TEAM YONSEI HAS THE SAME IDEA

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:41.621
My hand is 9-9.

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:42.789
He went with 9-9.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.890
That's a clincher.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.025
- Let's submit an answer if 8-4 wins.
- What's our rule?

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.694
The sum of AB's factors.

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:49.362
Here is the result of the turn.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:53.132
The winning hand is 8-4.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.169
- Let's try it.
- What are we writing?

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.371
Hit that buzzer.

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.044
Team SKKU.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.446
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST SUM OF FACTORS

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.181
- That is incorrect.
- Shoot.

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.316
Still, maybe we got somewhere close.

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:15.922
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.256
Let's pass this turn as well.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.159
- Wild guesses don't get you anywhere.
- Let's not gamble.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.162
I think we have to be sure of our answer.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.366
Let us begin the third turn of Round 1.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:30.103
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 8-4.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.205
How's this?

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.207
PARK SANG-YEON THOUGHT OF
A SQUARED MINUS B SQUARED

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:35.808
This works.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.210
Oh, I see that.

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:41.948
What's going on?

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.951
- This yields the same result as 8-4.
- Okay.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.521
Team Yonsei's hand is 7-1.

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:53.025
If the rule is A squared minus B squared,
as Team Yonsei predicted,

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.763
Team SNU in Medicine's hand of 8-4

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:59.399
will yield 48.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:02.835
And Team Yonsei's hand of 7-1

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.572
will also yield 48.

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.374
What can it be?

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.043
Let me think.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.079
A squared minus B squared.

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:14.747
- It works.
- A squared minus B squared?

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.048
Yes, it works.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.418
- Really?
- The difference of two squares.

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.619
This could be it.

00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:24.524
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.393
My hand is 7-3.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.798
If 8-4 and 7-1 yield the same results,
the rule is A squared minus B squared.

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:33.633
- When you apply it--
- Both yield 48.

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.535
- Did they go with 7-1 to confirm?
- Probably.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.769
I see.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:40.306
- The two new hands won't affect our test.
- No.

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:43.609
I hope the others won't notice
even if our theory checks out.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:45.545
Especially Team SNU in Medicine.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.581
We need to broaden our options.
What else could work?

00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:50.249
ONLY TEAM SNU CAN SUBMIT AN ANSWER

00:15:51.184 --> 00:15:53.252
What about the difference of two squares?

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.954
Like X squared minus Y squared.

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:56.589
JOO MIN-SEO THINKS OF THE SAME RULE

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.658
- The difference of two squares.
- What?

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:00.159
- I said it works.
- Right?

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.828
Let's test it out first.

00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:03.796
- I'll write it down anyway.
- Okay.

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:07.133
DESPITE FINDING
A PROMISING RULE FOR VICTORY

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.803
THE OTHER TWO TEAMS
CANNOT SUBMIT AN ANSWER

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:15.007
It seems joint winners
will get us big leads.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:17.376
Here is the result of the turn.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:21.314
The winning hands are 8-4 and 7-1.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.782
TEAM SKKU CAN'T MAKE A SUBMISSION

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:23.816
No, stay calm.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:25.618
Just a second.

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:28.788
Hey, wait.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.024
- It's the difference of two squares.
- Lower your voices.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:37.597
THE JOINT WINNING HANDS
TIPPED THE SCALE FOR TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.067
They're making a submission.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:47.640
I'm sure this is it.
Team Yonsei chose 7-1 just to confirm it.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.643
What a good find.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.812
Yeah, you're the best. Well done.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:53.946
Stay on your toes.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.815
- Oh, my heart is racing.
- You struck gold.

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:57.383
- Please...
- You're amazing.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.252
Team SNU in Medicine.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.020
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE
OF 2 SQUARED NUMBERS

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:02.088
That is correct.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.823
That concludes Round 1.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.360
- Great job.
- Round 1 ends in Team SNU's victory.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.730
We shouldn't jump the gun.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:17.670
We should check joint winners
only when we can submit an answer.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:19.505
It's okay.

00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:22.808
Let's smile when we've made it through.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.646
TEAM SKKU: 0, TEAM YONSEI: 0,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.815
Let us begin the first turn of Round 2.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:36.222
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.092
Want to try 2-2?

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.261
- That's not a bad idea.
- All right.

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.133
I'll give it to them
if they can match with 3-3.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.302
That proves that they can read the room.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.242
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 3-3.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.012
- Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 3-3.
- Way to go, guys.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.548
I can't wait to see the host's hand.

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:07.153
- He should go with 4-4. He has to.
- He will if he's tactful.

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:11.023
My hand is 4-4.

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.893
My hand is 4-4.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.562
Vibe check, success.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.032
Way to go, Mr. Host.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.767
Here is the result of the turn.

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:23.803
The winning hand is 2-2.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.173
Where does that leave us?

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.908
Simple operations don't work.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:32.778
What about remainders?
The rule might use it this time.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.181
The smaller the remainder
when divided by seven...

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.350
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.818
What stands out to you?

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.620
This could be about remainders.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.254
I'll work from that angle.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.991
Let us begin the second turn of Round 2.

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.726
Let's go with 5-5.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.962
Team SKKU's hand is 5-5.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.533
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-1.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.204
Let me see. They went with 7-1 and 5-5.

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.641
Let's test our theory this time.

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.275
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:05.211
We need a multiple of seven.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.779
A MULTIPLE OF 7 WON'T HAVE A REMAINDER

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.347
You have 30 seconds left.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.817
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-4.

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.386
IF THIS HAND WINS,
TEAM YONSEI WILL SUBMIT AN ANSWER

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:16.856
My hand is 3-6.

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:20.026
Here is the result of the turn.
The winning hand is 1-4.

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:24.563
You're running with this?

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.565
Why not? We proved our theory.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.534
Okay, then.

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.403
You will now be given two minutes.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.838
- We agreed to do this if it checks out.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:35.207
Team Yonsei, please submit your answer.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:36.876
What?

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.512
They found something just out of this?

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.014
I guess they chose 1-4 to prove something.

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:44.183
But what's their theory?

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.652
Their hand has the smallest remainder
when divided by seven.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:49.955
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE FIGURED OUT
THE SAME RULE AS TEAM YONSEI

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:53.125
The hand with the smallest remainder
when divided by seven. Write that down.

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.497
- If their answer is wrong...
- Go for it then.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:19:59.899
Team Yonsei.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:03.569
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.004
Team Yonsei.

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:06.238
That is incorrect.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:07.606
Again?

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:09.975
Let's take it step by step, guys.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:13.212
That is incorrect.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:16.382
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
HITS THE BUZZER RIGHT AWAY

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:18.551
Team SNU is being proactive

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:21.821
because they won a point
and would like to keep the lead.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.391
But we haven't won any points,
so let's proceed with caution.

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.861
Team SNU. That is incorrect.

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:31.230
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.099
We need a variety of ideas.

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.433
ONLY TEAM SKKU CAN ANSWER
FOR THE NEXT 2 TURNS

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.236
Let us begin the third turn of Round 2.

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:39.839
Here is the result of the turn.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.874
The winning hand is 1-4.

00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:43.943
We have 1-1 and 1-4. What's the rule?

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:45.478
Nothing comes to me.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.047
Why did 1-4 win?

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.750
Did you try swapping the numbers?

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.419
I did, but we still need more
to build a theory.

00:20:54.053 --> 00:20:57.456
- A times B is out.
- The factors won't do either, right?

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.093
Do you think swapping the numbers
will get us anywhere?

00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:03.262
My brain is dead.

00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:07.867
One plus...

00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:10.336
My mind keeps gravitating to remainders.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.470
You know...

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.240
I checked the remainders
when A plus B is divided by six.

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:15.975
Then, the winning hand is 1-4.

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:18.477
Well, that could work.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.980
WINNER: 1-4
REMAINDER WHEN A+B IS DIVIDED BY 6: 5

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.150
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 2.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.887
- Let's go with 1-1.
- We can't answer anyway.

00:21:28.821 --> 00:21:32.158
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:36.362
Team SKKU's hand is 8-2.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:37.296
Let's go with 2-2.

00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:39.331
Is it the best choice for us?

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.333
It'd give them the least information.

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:44.804
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-2.

00:21:46.005 --> 00:21:48.841
TEAM SKKU SMILES
AFTER SEEING TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAND

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:51.243
3 MINUTES AGO
Team Yonsei went for 1-1,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.478
so Team SNU would go for 2-2.

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:53.813
Its remainder is four.

00:21:53.913 --> 00:21:55.147
What has the same result?

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:57.650
There's 8-2. Let's use that.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.251
TEAM SKKU PRESENTED 8-2 ON PURPOSE

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:02.188
Team SKKU's hand is 8-2.

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:04.356
If they both win, hit the buzzer.

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.459
Here is the result of the turn.

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:10.663
The winning hands are 8-2 and 2-2.

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:15.000
- The winning hands are 8-2 and 2-2.
- Let's go.

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.205
- Let's go.
- Why did they clap just now?

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:20.873
Hit it.

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:25.277
What did they come up with?

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:26.946
I'm clueless.

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:29.748
Team SKKU.

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.818
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST REMAINDER
WHEN A+B IS DIVIDED BY 6

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:34.053
That is correct.

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:37.756
What's the rule?

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:38.858
What was it?

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.426
They did an amazing job, anyway.

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:43.596
- You have to give it to them.
- We couldn't have won.

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:45.331
- What was it?
- That concludes Round 1.

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.866
What can it be?

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:49.602
So what's the rule? I'm lost here.

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:52.004
- That was sick.
- Tae-hun.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.840
I'll now reveal
the rule for victory of Round 2.

00:22:55.541 --> 00:23:00.145
It is the hand with the largest remainder
when A plus B is divided by six.

00:23:01.013 --> 00:23:03.249
- Oh, they added two numbers.
- The addition.

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.050
The sum of both numbers.

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:06.585
We can still survive.

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:08.687
All we need to do is win one more round.

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:12.057
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM YONSEI: 0, TEAM SKKU: 1
THE TEAM THAT WINS 2 ROUNDS FIRST SURVIVES

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.627
This might be it for Team Yonsei.

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:17.696
We can win this round
and get back on an equal footing.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.865
Back to square one.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.935
Let us begin the first turn of Round 3.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.037
TEAM SKKU IS GOING FIRST

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.072
Let's stick with 7-2.

00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:31.377
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:34.813
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-1.

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.216
- They love that pair.
- It must be their favorite.

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:39.184
Our favorite is 7-2.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:45.391
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-7.

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.127
They're checking if symmetry is involved.

00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:51.063
My hand is 2-7.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.565
We'll get a mother lode of information.

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:56.402
- Everyone will be ready for that.
- Two mirror images.

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.372
Here is the result of the turn.

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:04.043
The winning hands are 7-2 and 2-7.

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.414
Symmetry is definitely involved.
Let's get to work.

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:11.450
We still need to tread carefully.

00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:15.988
Let's wait for the next turn's result,
analyze it, and then make a submission.

00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:19.124
We'll have to pour our everything
into this round.

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.859
We're going all-in.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:28.767
Let us begin the second turn of Round 3.

00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:33.238
TEAM YONSEI: 6-6, TEAM SKKU: 9-4,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1-1

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.541
My hand is 9-9.

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:37.609
Here is the result of the turn.

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.611
The winning hand is 9-4.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.180
What can this be?

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.282
The bigger, the better, right?

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:45.517
How come 9-9 didn't win?

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:51.857
Let us begin the third turn of Round 3.

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:56.428
Here is the result of the turn.
The winning hands are 5-9 and 9-5.

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:03.669
No, not that one.

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.638
The least common multiple?

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.374
The least common multiple.

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:10.209
THE SMALLEST COMMON MULTIPLE OF 2 NUMBERS

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.343
You have one minute left.

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.313
- That works. The LCM can be it.
- What about this one?

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:17.116
Yeah, you're right. It fits our data.

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.917
We'll need to choose our hand well.

00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:21.820
Yes, let's consider our hand carefully.

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:26.158
All the winning hands had a larger result
when the two numbers were multiplied.

00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:29.028
WINNING HANDS OF THE 1ST TURN IN ROUND 3

00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:31.063
The host's hand was 9-9.

00:25:31.163 --> 00:25:32.931
There were also 9-4 and 6-6.

00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:36.568
I was rather confused
when 9-4 was declared the winning hand.

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:40.005
I assumed 9-9 would win,
so I tried to find out why 9-4 won.

00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:43.709
I noticed that the pair
with the same numbers didn't win.

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:44.843
So...

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.845
6 TIMES 6 AND 9 TIMES 4
HAVE THE SAME PRODUCT

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.914
BUT ONLY 9-4 WAS SELECTED
AS THE WINNING HAND

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:52.217
That's when I was convinced
that the rule was based on the LCM.

00:25:54.253 --> 00:25:55.587
Did we check the LCM?

00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:56.755
What? Hang on.

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.624
- Wait, does this...
- It fits with all the data.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.560
- I think this is it.
- Let's wait for one more turn.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.796
Our only viable option is the LCM.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.764
They wrote down something.

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:07.966
Team SKKU has an answer.

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:09.735
What now?

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:12.171
We have to submit our answer
the moment our theory checks out.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:14.373
Looks like they're ready for a submission.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.743
Team Yonsei has put their answer
in the envelope.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.946
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 3.

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:24.616
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-8.

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:27.920
- The LCM for that is eight.
- Chung-seo.

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:30.823
Can we swap places?

00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.358
Team Yonsei, please show us your hand.

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:36.995
- Let's opt for a pair with a large LCM.
- How's 8-9?

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:39.998
- How about 8-7?
- Let's go with that.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.435
Team Yonsei's hand is 8-7.

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:44.636
THEIR LCM IS 56

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:49.208
- Instead of going for bigger numbers--
- Try something with a smaller LCM.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.576
All right.

00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:52.978
- How's 8-6?
- Let's go with 8-6.

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:53.946
Okay.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.683
THEIR LCM IS 24
Team SKKU's hand is 8-6.

00:26:57.983 --> 00:27:00.586
My hand is 7-5.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.654
My hand is 7-5.

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:05.824
Hit the buzzer if 8-7 wins.
Keep your hand on it.

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:07.826
LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE OF EACH HAND

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:11.497
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.298
Here is the result of the turn.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.971
The winning hand is 8-7.

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.439
The winning hand is 8-7.

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:22.841
The winning hand is 8-7.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:30.415
Team Yonsei, please submit your answer.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:32.017
I should've pushed it quicker.

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.352
Let's wait. It's okay.

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:34.786
Oh, please...

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.588
- I'm sure it's right.
- Please...

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.891
- Our odds are good.
- Just this once.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:40.292
Let's all pray.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.727
- Come on, Chung-seo.
- Christian faith.

00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:44.029
Oh, please. We're a Christian school.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.697
Round 3.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:47.499
Team Yonsei.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.800
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST
LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:49.735
"That is correct."

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:51.003
Team Yonsei.

00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.038
That is correct.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.707
You're overdoing it.

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.209
That concludes Round 3.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.312
- Round 3 ends in Team Yonsei's victory.
- Thank goodness.

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:03.048
- That was a narrow escape.
- Let's go.

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.083
Okay, we've got this.

00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:07.085
We have a tie now.

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.091
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1,
TEAM YONSEI: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

00:28:15.394 --> 00:28:16.995
Don't worry about it.

00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:18.564
We can win the next round.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.735
- That never occurred to us.
- The LCM?

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:27.239
Why didn't I think of that?

00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:30.108
That never came to mind.

00:28:31.343 --> 00:28:33.845
Okay, I'm getting the hang of it.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.084
High five, Chung-seo.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.220
Let's focus.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:46.558
It's neck and neck.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.727
One point each? Oh, man.

00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:50.696
Each team has one point.

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:52.798
- We fight to the death now.
- For sure.

00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:54.600
- Damn.
- Let's get that point.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.501
This is it. Focus for Round 4.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.870
- We're wrapping things up here.
- Okay.

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:03.375
Let us begin the first turn of Round 4.

00:29:04.276 --> 00:29:06.778
Good. Let's start it off with 1-1.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:09.348
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:11.984
- Want to go with 7-2?
- Okay.

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.252
To keep them in check.

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:16.688
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:18.824
- How about 2-7?
- You want 2-7?

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:23.729
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-7.

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.698
My hand is 3-7.

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:30.002
Here is the result of the turn.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:31.570
The winning hand is 3-7.

00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.374
What's this about?

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:37.776
I have zero clue.

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:42.648
We need to come up
with good ideas quickly.

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:45.117
- Keep it calm, but...
- Calm and quick.

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:48.086
Exactly. We need to be calm and quick.

00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:50.188
Let us begin the second turn of Round 4.

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:52.324
Here is the result of the turn.

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.959
The winning hand is 4-9.

00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:57.663
The hand with the largest number
when AB is swapped.

00:29:57.763 --> 00:30:00.432
It might be the hand with the largest
number when AB is swapped.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:03.502
We could get a rule
about swapping numbers.

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:06.471
Let us begin the third turn of Round 4.

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:09.574
Team SKKU's hand is 2-4.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.144
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 1-2.

00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:15.814
Why don't we try this
to keep the others in the dark?

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:18.483
Are we testing the number swap theory?

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.951
- Yes.
- Got it.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.854
Team Yonsei's hand is 3-8.

00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:26.024
My hand is 5-5.

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:27.793
Here is the result of the turn.

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.761
The winning hand is 3-8.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:30.796
See?

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.432
- All this can't be a simple coincidence.
- No.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.866
You think this can be it?

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:37.669
Let's submit it.
You do the honors, Chung-seo.

00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:39.304
- I'll hit it.
- Yes, and go deliver it.

00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:43.041
They must've found something.

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:46.845
It's time to pray again.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:51.149
Please let us survive this.
I don't want to go home yet.

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.353
Team Yonsei.

00:30:54.453 --> 00:30:57.322
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN TWO NUMBERS ARE SWAPPED

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:58.724
That is incorrect.

00:30:58.824 --> 00:31:00.926
This won't take so long.

00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:06.865
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:09.735
- How was it not the answer? What a shame.
- What is it, then?

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.038
What a relief.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.843
Let's hurry, guys.
Run the numbers quickly.

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:19.111
One thing is for sure.

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.747
The second number
must be larger than the first one.

00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:26.518
Let's see.
The second number does matter, but...

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:28.720
For what, exactly?

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.757
The rule might be
a slight variation of our answer

00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:33.959
that centers around B being larger than A.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.262
- You have a point.
- Sounds plausible.

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:40.732
It must have something to do
with the second number being larger.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:47.939
Well, how's this?

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:51.209
Oh, that's a good idea.

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:53.678
How's this?

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:56.581
It's not so random, so this can be it.

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.751
Did you apply it to all the samples?

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:00.952
It checked out so far.

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.220
- All of them?
- Yes.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:05.624
Let's test it first.
We can go for it if our hand wins.

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:08.693
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 4.

00:32:08.994 --> 00:32:11.930
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-2.

00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:14.966
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-2.

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:18.937
Team SKKU's hand is 2-6.

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.907
My hand is 9-3.

00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:26.445
TEAM SKKU PLANS TO SUBMIT AN ANSWER
IF 2-6 IS THE WINNING HAND

00:32:26.545 --> 00:32:27.345
Come on.

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:28.980
Here is the result of the turn.

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:36.621
The winning hand is 2-6.

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.825
This is it, right?

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.295
Wait, I'm getting weak.

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:45.030
Do we scream out loud if we win?

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.832
But won't the other teams mind?

00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:48.767
We didn't even do a chant.

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:50.268
Let's just punch in the air.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.038
- Yelling is just too much.
- That's true.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.745
Please get it wrong.

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:02.747
Team SKKU.

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.783
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST RESULT
WHEN A+B IS MULTIPLIED BY B

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.151
That is correct.

00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:10.789
Seriously...

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:12.524
Well done, you.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:20.799
Team SKKU, safe.

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:22.868
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.604
- I can't even guess the rule.
- What a bummer.

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:33.078
It's okay. Let's get Team SNU eliminated.

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:36.681
Team SKKU won two rounds first

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:39.784
and secured their survival
from the Deathmatch.

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:42.020
Please return to your base camp.

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:43.788
- Let's go.
- Let's tidy up a bit.

00:33:45.257 --> 00:33:46.191
Good luck.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:49.094
You've got this.

00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:51.096
- The winner gets to be our ally.
- You bet.

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:52.697
They'll actually be our ally tomorrow.

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:53.798
You're right.

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:57.002
- Let's relax and enjoy the match.
- I'll sleep like a baby tonight.

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:59.638
- You were all amazing.
- Come here, guys.

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:02.107
I'm stoked!

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:03.742
Seriously, guys...

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:04.910
I love it.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.344
We did great.

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:09.915
I was really relieved
that we didn't get eliminated.

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:14.119
I even teared up a bit
because I felt so happy.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.854
That boosted my confidence again.

00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:18.089
Basically, we defeated
the others in our division.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:23.862
I think we proved that Team SKKU
has a place in Elite League Season 3.

00:34:24.763 --> 00:34:27.532
Deathmatch, Mystery Poker.

00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:31.136
Team SNU in Medicine and Team Yonsei

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.004
will continue with the game.

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:37.776
Both teams will take turns
to present a pair of cards twice.

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:41.313
In total,
we will have four hands of cards.

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:46.384
As Team SNU in Medicine
and Team Yonsei are tied,

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:49.888
the team that identifies
the rule for victory in this round

00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:52.791
will secure their survival
from the Deathmatch.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:58.163
I can't believe Team SNU or Team Yonsei
will get eliminated just like that.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:02.400
It's mind-boggling to think
one of them is going home.

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:04.402
- We've got this.
- Good luck, guys.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:06.705
- We can do this.
- Of course.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:11.643
- The key is to broaden our perspectives.
- Let's be flexible.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.645
No offense to Team Yonsei,

00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:17.282
but we are determined to survive,
no matter what.

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:20.318
Remember. Let's not lose our cool.

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.588
Let's focus, guys.

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:28.660
Team SNU in Medicine had no luck
after winning Round 1.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.896
So I felt sure our chances were good.
I was ready to take them.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:34.499
Let us begin the first turn of Round 5.

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:38.169
Let's go with 9-6.

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:43.475
Team Yonsei's hand is 9-6.

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:48.446
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 4-4.

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.551
Team Yonsei's hand is 6-4.

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:57.489
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 6-3.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.659
Here is the result of the turn.

00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:02.494
The winning hand is 9-6.

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:06.331
Our takeaway for now is,
the bigger the X, the higher the rank.

00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:09.634
Let's stay open-minded,
but the first number should be large.

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:11.970
Are we going to check the factors?

00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:14.105
Does that rule check out?
Keep working on it.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.306
CHUNG-SEO'S GUESS: NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.476
Let us begin the second turn of Round 5.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.246
What should we present?

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:24.115
- Just large numbers?
- Let's go in that direction.

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:27.719
If we get an exception,
we can learn something from it.

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:34.059
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-6.

00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:36.695
I'll go with 2-7.

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:42.701
Team Yonsei's hand is 2-7.

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:45.503
They're avoiding bigger numbers.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.207
Would it be a bad choice to try 7-2?

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:52.544
As in their mirror image?
But we don't have to do that for them.

00:36:53.912 --> 00:36:56.047
I think 2-8 is a pretty good choice.

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.449
- Come again?
- I said 2-8.

00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:58.983
- Shall we use that?
- Okay.

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:02.353
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-8.

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.724
Team Yonsei's hand is 4-3.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.860
Here is the result of the turn.

00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:10.562
The winning hand is 9-6.

00:37:11.863 --> 00:37:14.199
Want to check the number of factors?

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:17.035
How about a hand
with the same number of factors as theirs?

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:20.472
I'm going to check the number of factors,
plain and simple.

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:23.174
- Does it work?
- Well, yes.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.776
Okay, test your theory.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.582
BOTH TEAMS ARE CONSIDERING
THE SAME RULE FOR VICTORY

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:33.218
Let us begin the third turn of Round 5.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.756
Team Yonsei's hand is 4-5.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.059
Why does she have a hand on the buzzer?

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:46.030
I guess it's out of habit.

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:51.136
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-4.

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:56.207
Team Yonsei's hand is 3-7.

00:37:56.508 --> 00:37:57.909
How's 7-5?

00:37:58.877 --> 00:37:59.878
What, 7-5?

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.081
- To aim for joint winners?
- Not bad.

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:07.519
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-5.

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:09.621
- Doesn't 45 have 6 factors?
- Yes.

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.689
- What did they put up?
- They went with 7-4.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.925
- Six and three...
- Three squared...

00:38:13.992 --> 00:38:16.761
Wait, 75 has 6 factors, too.
Should we wait?

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:20.265
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:24.135
The winning hands are 4-5 and 7-5.

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:28.940
That's a big clue.

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.110
- Do we try our luck?
- Should we?

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.312
- Go or no?
- Do we go for it or not?

00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:35.613
- Do it. In the end...
- Okay.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.515
Go for it. But don't share anything.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.853
No, I'm sure they got it wrong.

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:46.825
I desperately hoped
their answer would be wrong.

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.994
Please be correct.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.130
Whichever way I look at it,
this is the only answer.

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:54.732
Team SNU.

00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.802
THE HAND WITH THE MOST NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:38:57.869 --> 00:38:58.937
Please...

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:01.806
That is correct.

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:05.510
Great job.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.181
- Good work.
- Well done.

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.317
- Thanks, guys.
- Good job.

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:13.418
Great work.

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.055
The round ends
in Team SNU in Medicine's victory.

00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:18.389
You were amazing.

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.657
Great job.

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:46.618
Team Yonsei got eliminated.

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.353
Team Yonsei...

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:52.023
You know, I thought they were formidable.

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:02.567
First and foremost,
I felt terrible for my teammates.

00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:03.534
To be honest...

00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:08.039
In my haste to submit an answer
in the earlier rounds,

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:11.376
I hurt the team with the penalty.

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:14.212
I don't think
I was receptive enough to them.

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:17.749
That leaves me with regret
and a sense of shame.

00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:41.973
We let Team SNU in Medicine take Round 1
when we also had the answer ready.

00:40:42.073 --> 00:40:43.908
We could've survived...

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:46.811
I felt terrible for my skilled teammates.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:56.087
I was heartbroken.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:06.864
It's okay.

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:10.935
What do you mean we're going home?
That makes no sense.

00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:14.439
We're losing out big time.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:17.008
Think about all the fun games
they'll get to play.

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:18.609
I feel you there.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:21.279
- We won't get to try them.
- No.

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:24.449
I had so much fun here.

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:26.284
To think it ends today...

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:31.456
We still did great.

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:40.865
The second team to be eliminated
from Elite League Season 3 is

00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:43.001
Team Yonsei.

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:48.973
We have done so well so far.

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:51.109
It's okay.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.044
- We placed fifth?
- It's okay.

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:55.046
That in itself is historic.

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:56.314
It's all my fault.

00:41:58.116 --> 00:41:59.884
Seeing them like this
is just as upsetting.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:02.487
Facing them like this
makes my heart heavy.

00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:05.723
How could Team Yonsei go home so soon?

00:42:06.391 --> 00:42:07.825
This is incredible.

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:11.562
Team Yonsei, please exit the grounds.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.131
Let's go.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.504
Great work, everyone.

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:22.473
We'll get going.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.342
- Good work.
- Well done.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:29.080
We became close
in that little time we had together.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.681
I feel conflicted.

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:39.590
Our team is bound to be the best.

00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:42.360
We should consider that, too. Earlier...

00:42:42.427 --> 00:42:44.328
I think I was too assertive.

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:47.198
I should've been open to your input.

00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:49.734
Why did I have to be so headstrong?

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:54.105
I wasn't ready to listen to others
when I should have been all ears.

00:42:54.205 --> 00:42:57.108
My sincerest apologies.

00:42:57.208 --> 00:42:59.544
We were on our path
to achieve a higher goal

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.814
while resolving our differences.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.951
It's unfortunate
that our journey ended so soon.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:10.254
I was happy to compete
with brilliant friends by my side.

00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:12.423
That looks like fun.

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.126
Isn't it fun?

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:20.198
Sang-yeon, Yun-beom, and A-in
all worked together with me for the games.

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:22.100
I'd like to thank them for everything.

00:43:23.468 --> 00:43:27.205
When we first met, I was struck
by how competent everyone seemed.

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:29.474
Hey, we've got all the top students.

00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.275
I placed second in the pre-test.

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:32.944
I thought we could place high

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:36.948
or even win just as I badly wanted to,

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.584
but we ended up losing by a tiny margin.

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.820
I'm very sad it had to end like this.

00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.556
Okay, I'm getting the hang of it.

00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:47.658
We still did our best,

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:51.963
and I know that the others
gave their all just as we did.

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:55.666
I'm not going to look back
on our journey with only regret.

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:21.058
- It's another exciting day.
- It feels strange.

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:23.027
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:25.496
Our division is more energetic.

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:28.065
The medical teams
fought to the death just yesterday.

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.501
They got all excited
when another team made a mistake.

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.802
Right, that's true.

00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:34.071
Hilarious.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.307
We never argued with Team KAIST.

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.609
We're back.

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.680
It feels like home. Hi, we're back.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.815
I've grown attached.

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:47.752
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:50.655
DANCING MACHINE

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:53.991
- Let's copy her moves.
- She's relaxed enough to dance here.

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.662
Look at Dong-geon.

00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:00.364
You look like a total brainiac today.

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:01.866
I know. I look unreal.

00:45:01.933 --> 00:45:03.234
It's almost incredible.

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:05.536
With my hair parted
and with the glasses...

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.672
I'm like the epitome of SNU students.

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.207
I mean, you look really good.

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:10.474
They say smart is the new sexy.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.009
SELF-ACCLAIMED SMART AND SEXY

00:45:12.243 --> 00:45:14.011
- Yum-yum.
- We got some quail eggs.

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.179
TEAM SKKU'S BASE CAMP

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:19.116
These are so good.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:32.196
A DEEP SIGH

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:35.399
- What's the matter?
- The caffeine's traveling down my veins.

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:37.969
- Did it feel electrifying?
- Yeah, it's insane.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.940
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.610
The surviving teams are as follows.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:46.877
Just four.

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:50.147
In Medical Division,
Team SNU in Medicine and Team SKKU.

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.719
TEAM SKKU

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:57.521
- She moved on so quickly.
- I know.

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.624
We meant to whoop
after "Team SNU in Medicine."

00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:03.794
In STEM Division,
Team SNU in STEM and Team KAIST.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.064
It's 2-against-2.

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.700
Let's do our best today.

00:46:11.736 --> 00:46:14.605
Feels like STEM Division
is better than Medical Division.

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.307
In yesterday's main match,

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:18.142
we just flattened them.

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.977
The stat difference was unbelievable.

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:22.647
Let's win again and avoid the Deathmatch.

00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:24.982
- I badly want that, too.
- Oh, please...

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:26.651
If we can make it through the day...

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:29.620
I've said that tons of times already.
Anyway, it will feel amazing.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.157
We can just keep that mindset every day.

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:35.860
Focus on survival every day,
and we'll be at the finals.

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:40.731
Don't you think we'll have
a full-scale Ace Selection today?

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.834
Because we have fewer people?
We have only eight on each side.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.836
Isn't it about time
they test our memorization?

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:48.973
You have a point.
We haven't had a memorization game yet.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.509
Today's plan. Jong-yun will win
the memorization game as our Ace player.

00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:52.643
Then, we win the main match.

00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:54.345
Nice and neat.

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.216
My gut tells me we'll skip the Ace Match
and do something else.

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:02.620
We could go right into the main match.

00:47:02.687 --> 00:47:03.754
That's possible.

00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:05.823
Yeah, it's just 2-against-2 now.

00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:10.795
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.863
Starting from today,

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:18.502
there will be
no Ace Selection or Ace Match.

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.906
Oh, no.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.809
We will play
the day's main match right away.

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:27.845
I didn't see this coming.

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:30.448
Way to make us nervous from the start.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.083
Yeah, we got no warning at all.

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:34.185
The main match directly?
Man, I'll need to focus.

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:36.821
No Ace Match to wake your brain up.

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:38.856
Let's dive into the main match!

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.624
Does that mean there's no benefit?

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.861
- I think so. Just fair and square.
- No additional setups?

00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:45.463
It's for the better.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.099
How will they manage without the benefit?

00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:49.033
Poor guys.

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.468
Tell me about it.

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.904
I love it. We have a nice diversity here.

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:57.908
Whatever the creators throw at us,
we're less likely to be overwhelmed.

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:00.711
All contestants,
please gather at the main hall

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.913
- for the main match.
- For the main match.

00:48:03.948 --> 00:48:05.249
Let's go!

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.183
Good luck.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.852
- Let's go.
- All right.

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.926
Another day begins.

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.030
I wanted to do well in the main match.

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:21.932
My goal was to avoid the Deathmatch again.

00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:24.702
Let's do our best.

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:25.603
Good luck.

00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:28.973
The finals will be
our one and only Deathmatch.

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:31.242
Now that I've experienced the Deathmatch,

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:34.879
I know about the stress
and the pressure we have to endure.

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.680
We'll make sure that Medical Division...

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.516
We'll win, no matter what.

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.752
- I wonder what the game is.
- I can't wait to find out.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:43.053
I'm dying to know.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.122
Today's main match is...

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:46.757
Just like that?

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.328
...Signal Investigation 3.

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:56.000
TEAM KAIST IS ASTOUNDED AT THE NEWS

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.869
BEFORE THE MAIN MATCH
What will it be?

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.172
- We might get Signal Investigation.
- Definitely.

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:03.307
- Signal Investigation 3.
- Signal Investigation 3.

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.010
My amazing deduction skills.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.547
With a top-class skill like this,
I'd say we won already.

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.482
Wow, this should be good.

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:14.952
- Not bad. It's not a memorization game.
- We need to see what it's about.

00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:17.588
- That's true.
- The setup can change everything.

00:49:17.655 --> 00:49:20.558
Signal Investigation in Season 1
and Season 2 were nothing alike.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.460
In Signal Investigation 3,

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.029
you will have to examine
the sentences and the photos

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:27.031
to identify the culprit.

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.967
There will be a total of two rounds.

00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:31.202
In Round 1,

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:33.938
you will be presented with cards
that have parts of one sentence.

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:36.674
There will be 2 sets of 55 cards.

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:40.444
In other words,
you will receive a total of 110 cards.

00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:43.948
Please note that the numbers on the cards
are in a random sequence.

00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:50.020
During Round 1,
you must make sense of the 55 sentences

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.591
to deduce the eight suspects' professions.

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:56.794
The team that succeeds in identifying
all suspects' professions

00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:01.398
can immediately start their task
for Round 2 and find the culprit.

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:04.768
From that point,

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:08.539
all teams must complete their tasks
in 1 hour and 30 minutes.

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.208
There's a time limit.

00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:16.780
Teams that go into Round 2
will be given a code to the safe.

00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:20.484
Inside the safe, you will find 20 photos
from the security camera

00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:26.190
and 9 photos of the persons of interest,
including 8 suspects and 1 victim.

00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:31.529
The four teams must combine the clues
gathered from the photos and the sentences

00:50:31.629 --> 00:50:33.664
to identify the culprit.

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:35.833
When the game ends,

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.204
the time each teams took to apprehend
the culprit will be added by division.

00:50:40.271 --> 00:50:43.641
The division that apprehended the culprit
in less time will survive,

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.177
while the losing division
will compete in a Deathmatch right away.

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.880
- Everyone has to pull their weight.
- Yes.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.983
Please start discussing your strategies.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.986
You'll be given 20 minutes.

00:50:57.187 --> 00:51:00.824
First, the basic information.
We need to find the eight professions.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.193
Yes, we need to quickly find
what they are.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.564
Let's look for phrases linked to jobs.

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:07.765
Yes, the related phrases.

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:09.900
For instance, keywords about a magician

00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:12.102
or something about a chef.

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:14.538
We get 55 sentences,

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:16.473
- so we should sort them well.
- Agreed.

00:51:16.574 --> 00:51:18.475
We should designate a section for each job

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:22.379
and put all the relevant cards there.

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.014
That's an idea.

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.850
We obviously need to do well individually,
but teamwork will matter, too.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:27.918
That's for sure.

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:29.887
We should assign roles strategically.

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:32.389
My takeaway from Signal Investigation 2

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.258
is that STEM students like us

00:51:34.325 --> 00:51:37.561
tend to lose their way
when they get fixated on conclusive leads.

00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:39.463
We have to play with an open mind.

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.865
We have to let our intuition
guide us sometimes

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.568
to speed through a game like this.

00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:47.104
Intuition always plays a huge role
in logic puzzles.

00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:50.975
Get your mojo up
and send it to your brain.

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:54.745
First off, we need an 8-by-8 table.

00:51:56.647 --> 00:51:59.984
If we feel sure
about a certain person's job,

00:52:00.084 --> 00:52:01.352
we'll use a circle.

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:04.622
If there's a high probability,
we'll use a triangle.

00:52:04.722 --> 00:52:07.591
If something can be ruled out,
we can mark it with an X.

00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:11.328
If there's even the slightest possibility,
we'll use a triangle.

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:14.898
I think the key is to finish
the task for Round 1 as soon as possible.

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:17.101
Reducing time in Round 1
will be essential.

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:20.137
It would give our division a big boost.

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:22.272
Then our division won't lose.

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.608
- It'll be a race to the finish.
- Yeah.

00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:27.211
In a game like this, one mistake is fatal.

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:28.746
We need precision.

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:29.980
CAN'T AFFORD A MISTAKE

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:33.617
When matching a person to a job,
at least two people should confirm it.

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:35.452
- Yes, let's double-check.
- Okay.

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.821
Then let's split the cards.

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.990
- You guys can take Set A.
- Yeah?

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:43.093
First, let's tackle the first set of cards

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.296
- so we can combine the information later.
- Yes, we'll do that.

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.834
A transitive verb
requires a direct object.

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:54.405
If there is a conjunction like "and,"
we'll set that card aside.

00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:56.140
The tense could matter, too.

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:58.375
- If a card has the word "yesterday,"
- You're right.

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:00.844
it should be matched
with a card using the past tense.

00:53:01.412 --> 00:53:03.580
We thought it would be good

00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:08.519
to strategize first
with the grammatical aspects or syntax.

00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:10.354
When sorting out the cards,

00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:13.957
we should see if it only has a subject,
or a subject and an addressee.

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.160
Same with verbs.
Let's see if it needs a complement.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:20.597
We can also get an intransitive verb
or a transitive verb.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:22.366
Let's use this as our guide.

00:53:22.433 --> 00:53:24.735
Once a variety
of specific guides are set up

00:53:24.835 --> 00:53:27.004
- and we keep categorizing the cards...
- We must keep at it.

00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:29.707
- That would help us narrow things down.
- Exactly.

00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:31.909
Even with the system we set up,

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:34.411
we may still miss something
or make a mistake.

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:39.216
So someone needs to examine our work
and check if there is an alternative take.

00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:41.051
I can take on that role.

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:44.154
- I'm often called a skeptic.
- Okay, you can check our work.

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.991
Be critical, okay?
Tell us if anything looks shaky.

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.060
Hit us with everything you can think of.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.731
You have five minutes left
to discuss your strategy.

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:55.766
Let's brainstorm for Round 2 a bit.

00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:59.636
We're getting photos
from the same angle in Round 2, right?

00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:01.839
It will be like those escape room games.

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:04.942
Like, we might have to catch
the changes in item arrangement.

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:09.046
If the events take place outdoors,
we'll have to look for a clock tower or...

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:13.383
We can look at the length of the shadows
if there are no clocks around.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:17.321
Grass on the ground may get flattened
if someone passed that point.

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:21.892
The photos will give us various clues,
such as time.

00:54:21.959 --> 00:54:24.261
I'd like us to log them separately.

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:28.098
I just know that you'll help us out
big time in Round 2, Tae-hun.

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.933
I hope I can oblige.

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.401
Let's go get it.

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:35.305
This is the type of game
we wanted the most for a main match.

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:37.407
I've been hoping for a game like this

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:39.610
because when memorization
or calculation is involved,

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:42.312
- we can't beat the med students.
- We can't beat the med students.

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:44.915
Our odds are better
in strategy or deduction games.

00:54:44.982 --> 00:54:48.118
We won yesterday because the game
wasn't about calculation or memorization.

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:50.954
All of us felt good
about our deduction skills,

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:54.458
so I thought we had the game in the bag.

00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:56.827
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:54:56.927 --> 00:54:58.428
STRATEGY MEETING OVER

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.364
Let's do this.

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:03.801
I'm afraid the STEM guys will kill it.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.503
- No, this is our thing.
- Really?

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:09.973
This tests your sheer analytical skills,
so we get the upper hand.

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:12.676
GOOD LUCK, MEDICAL DIVISION

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.148
What's with the little sexy move?

00:55:19.817 --> 00:55:20.851
Why?

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:22.719
I think I saw some hip shimmies.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.688
He did this yesterday, too.

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:25.856
He did that just now.

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:27.090
He did this yesterday, too.

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.292
Hey, Ji-hu just danced.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.527
This is very unusual.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:34.665
GOOD LUCK, JI-HU AND JI-HOO

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.934
Before we begin the game,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.870
we will give you a summary of the events
leading up to the case.

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:44.541
The events take place in 2075,
the era of commercialized space travel.

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:48.745
Space 7, the perfect artificial
gravity system for space stations,

00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:51.148
simulated Earth's gravity so well

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:55.652
that it became the first major success
as a destination to visit in space.

00:55:55.719 --> 00:56:00.123
Adam, the CEO behind Space 7's success
and the face of space commercialization,

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.360
even ventured into anti-aging research

00:56:03.427 --> 00:56:06.196
using Mars Stone,
a newly discovered substance on Mars.

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:10.834
He supported the research for a new drug
and named the project "Stone of Eternity."

00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:15.706
With the new drug's release approaching,
a commercial was to be shot on Mars.

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:18.709
To oversee the process,
Adam boarded Space 7.

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:22.012
But only a day before the shoot,

00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:27.351
Adam was found dead in his cabin.

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:31.255
Space 7 is an isolated spacecraft.

00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:35.726
Which one of the passengers
is responsible for Adam's death?

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:39.796
One person among the eight suspects
committed the foul deed.

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:42.266
8 SUSPECTS IN ADAM'S MURDER

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.802
We will now begin Round 1.

00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:46.803
IDENTIFY THE SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS

00:56:46.904 --> 00:56:47.905
MAIN MATCH
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 3

00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:53.110
- Let's do our best.
- Let's do this.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.178
- Don't rush. Work at our pace.
- Okay!

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.282
A BOX WITH 110 SENTENCE CARDS

00:56:58.382 --> 00:56:59.716
The 55 cards are all here?

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:00.617
55 IN EACH SET

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.953
55 CARDS OF SET A CONTAIN
THE FIRST HALF OF A SENTENCE

00:57:03.053 --> 00:57:06.790
THEY INTRODUCE THE PERSON(S)
PLAYING A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE SENTENCE

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.192
55 CARDS OF SET B CONTAIN
THE SECOND HALF OF A SENTENCE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:13.430
THEY INCLUDE A VERB,
AN OBJECT, OR A COMPLEMENT

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.633
A TOTAL OF 110 CARDS

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:19.736
That's the A-1 card. Let's look for Set B.

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.638
- Three, two, one. There we go.
- Good.

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:22.773
We'll handle Set A.

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:25.642
KANG JI-HOO AND KIM JAE-HAN ON SET A

00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:27.244
- Dylan.
- Okay, Dylan.

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:28.445
Put Adam cards here.

00:57:28.512 --> 00:57:32.115
GROUPING THE CARDS BY THE NAMES
Christopher. Jennifer.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:37.054
One person can go make notes on the board.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.088
A YouTuber?

00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:39.656
MAKING A TABLE TO LIST
ALL THE NAMES AND THE PROFESSIONS

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:41.925
That person can be the engineer.

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:43.126
Okay, got it.

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:45.629
"Harry's Murder on the Two-lane Road..."

00:57:45.696 --> 00:57:48.332
- I think we have a writer.
- A writer.

00:57:48.432 --> 00:57:51.635
Let's write down everything.
I see there aren't so many jobs.

00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:55.539
10 POSSIBLE PROFESSIONS FOR THE 8 SUSPECTS

00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:57.641
SECURITY GUARD, MANAGER,
ENGINEER, ACTOR, EDITOR, YOUTUBER

00:57:57.708 --> 00:57:59.543
ROOKIE, PHYSICIAN AND RESEARCHER,
CHEF, WRITER

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:02.279
Can you tell me all the professions?

00:58:02.346 --> 00:58:03.347
WRITING THEM DOWN

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.082
Actor, manager.

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.785
Physician and researcher.
That's one person.

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.320
One person with two jobs.

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:13.023
Who would handle patrol duty?

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:15.459
- Head of security, right?
- Yes, it's here.

00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:17.961
Patrol duty. It's the second column.

00:58:18.028 --> 00:58:19.696
SECURITY GUARD

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:23.300
It says someone must check the equipment.
That's the engineer's job.

00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:26.003
ENGINEER

00:58:26.303 --> 00:58:28.171
Let's dig into the YouTuber.

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:29.106
...HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL'S...

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:33.343
If a card uses a verb like "ask," wouldn't
the matching card elaborate on that?

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:34.378
- Of course.
- Right?

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:36.847
- As in, "A asked B to do C."
- Oh, sure.

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.348
FOCUSING ON VERBS
THAT REQUIRE A COMPLEMENT

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:40.050
Grouping cards with similar verbs

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.119
- could be helpful.
- Good idea.

00:58:42.486 --> 00:58:44.688
- Verbs like ask, request, or tell...
- Yeah.

00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:45.856
I'll start from here.

00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:48.692
Verbs that need a complement...

00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:50.994
"Harry messaged his editor..."

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:52.929
- I think this is it.
- Really?

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.464
That's the last one that fits the bill.

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.299
Really? Let's check the verbs.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:58.535
5 CARD WITH VERBS
THAT REQUIRES A COMPLEMENT

00:58:58.602 --> 00:59:01.505
Look for cards from Set B
that might be their matches.

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:02.873
CARDS THAT MAY BE A MATCH

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:03.840
Look at this.

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.743
- This can be the content of a message.
- Right, let's see if someone sent one.

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.512
"That she scraped her arm on the pipe."

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:09.913
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT

00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:11.481
"That he heard Gabriel's voice..."

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:13.183
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.152
"For taking his role."

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:17.020
CARD WITH A PREPOSITIONAL COMPLEMENT

00:59:17.087 --> 00:59:19.589
"With a bottle of wine as a gift."

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:20.690
CARD WITH A PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.326
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT
This here would need a fitting verb

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.529
- because it's a request.
- Right.

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:31.234
We found 5 cards from Set A
and 5 cards from Set B to match...

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:32.769
Wait, we have six cards.

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.372
5 CARDS FROM SET A,
6 CARDS FROM SET B

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:40.110
THE CARDS FROM SET B
OUTNUMBER THE CARDS FROM SET A

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.712
There are too many of them
for us to review.

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:46.783
THE GRAMMATICAL APPROACH ISN'T EFFECTIVE

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:49.119
Are we really going to categorize them?

00:59:49.219 --> 00:59:50.787
Won't that be too difficult?

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:54.658
- Yeah, it's just...
- It's too big a challenge.

00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:56.927
Let's just use our intuition
to match them.

00:59:56.993 --> 01:00:00.263
- Just go with your intuition.
- That might be the right approach.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.299
One more thing.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.768
These cards tell a story together.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.603
B-43 and A-43 both mention
Dylan getting fired.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.737
Judging from that,

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:11.408
we won't need to get fixated
on matching an A card with a B card.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.578
Look at B-25 and B-45.

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.146
They both mention subscribers.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:18.815
They have to be about the same person.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.550
Yes, that has to be the case.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.619
Guys, about that YouTuber.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:23.687
That's Jennifer.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.021
JENNIFER IS THE YOUTUBER?

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.022
- How so?
- Are you sure?

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.425
It says Jennifer filmed
an unapproved location.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:29.693
ADAM ARGUED THAT JENNIFER FILMED...

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.563
Out of all the jobs on the cards,
only a YouTuber would do that.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.499
The YouTuber is a woman.

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:39.503
So the YouTuber has to be
either Jennifer or Christina.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.404
- Only these two are women.
- That's Christopher.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.673
- Jennifer is likely the YouTuber.
- You bet.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.509
There's a high chance
Jennifer is the YouTuber.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:46.810
- She is?
- Yeah.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:48.311
Jennifer enjoys going on trips.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.413
Then, this card about her travel content

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.183
should be connected
to her YouTube channel's growth.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.286
I like this. Can we confirm this pair?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:01.324
JENNIFER BOARDED SPACE 7 TO FILM
THE EXPERIENCE FOR HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:06.296
Bella took care of the equipment failure.
She must be an engineer.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.299
Bella resolved the equipment failure.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:10.467
She's an engineer.

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.736
- So Bella's an engineer.
- Yes.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:17.040
BELLA IS AN ENGINEER ON SPACE 7

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:22.045
We discussed
how Gabriel is likely the physician.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.148
Someone with an injured hand
came to see Gabriel.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:27.184
- Okay, then...
- Should we assume he's a physician?

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:28.451
The physician...

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.021
- Gabriel is a physician.
- He's a physician?

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.389
A-8 and B-9 match.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:33.924
Isn't he the researcher?

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.026
He's a physician and researcher.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:41.031
GABRIEL IS A PHYSICIAN ON SPACE 7
WORKING ON THE NEW DRUG RESEARCH

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.400
...NEW BOOK SET IN A SPACECRAFT...
Harry is writing a new book.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.835
- You're right.
- He's the writer.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.704
Guys, remember that card?

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:50.540
One mentioned Harry's book,
Murder on the Two-lane Road.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.511
I think that should be followed
by how it was based on a real event.

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:56.513
Aren't these two a good match?

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.248
Hey, I like this.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.517
- Harry is the writer.
- Yes, he is.

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:05.088
HARRY IS WORKING ON HIS NEW BOOK
THAT TAKES PLACE IN A SPACECRAFT

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.324
We only have a few jobs left.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.692
Let's look for more.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.260
Any mention of a security guard?

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.196
"Security guard."
We've got a security guard.

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:14.931
One of them must be a chef.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.233
ADAM STATED THAT HE WANTED A NEW CHEF...

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.567
Write down manager.

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.868
- Manager?
- Yeah.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.905
"Edward told his manager..."
It seems he has a manager.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.241
What if Edward is an actor
and has a manager?

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:26.376
So he's an actor with a manager?

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.913
These cards say Edward was enraged
at the rookie Frank.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.449
- Right.
- Doesn't it mean Frank is also an actor?

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:34.618
We must have two actors,
a veteran and a rookie.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.786
That's a possibility.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:39.990
Guys, look. It says Edward
was enraged at the rookie Frank.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.291
What do we make of "rookie"?

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.426
That term is usually associated with...

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:46.396
I'd say he's likely an actor, but...

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.898
Wait, he could be a writer, too.

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.400
He could be new to YouTube

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.469
- or the culinary field.
- Yes, he could be a chef.

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:54.304
- That keyword...
- It doesn't tell us much.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.805
FRANK, A ROOKIE

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.441
WHAT IS FRANK'S PROFESSION?

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:02.445
Let's revisit Christopher and Frank.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.180
- Christopher...
- "When he got no replies..."

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.448
Replies?

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.784
As for messaging back and forth...

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:10.954
I think I saw a couple of cards
about the actor texting people.

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:13.390
Look, he complained
about being insulted "via text."

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.991
Do we know who the actor is?

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.295
Wait, Christopher got overlooked.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.764
- He got overlooked?
- Yes, for promotion.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:24.200
I'd say he's the manager.
But do managers get promoted?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.136
CAN CHRISTOPHER BE THE MANAGER?

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:30.507
Team SKKU's submission...

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:34.611
on the suspect information was correct.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.313
- Which team was it?
- Team SKKU.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.014
Damn it.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.117
I thought we were moving along quite fast.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.486
I was caught off guard
by Team SKKU's quick success.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:47.023
- Shoot.
- Let's get back to work. Nice and steady.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.693
Ji-hu, that little rascal,
got ahead of me.

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:50.960
This was bad.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.431
- That was awesome.
- I killed it, didn't I?

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:57.334
TEAM SKKU SUCCEEDED QUICKLY
THANKS TO SUNG TAE-HUN

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.669
- I can't believe it. What the heck, dude?
- That's insane!

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:01.905
PASSCODE SECURED
It's 18751879.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.909
We owe it to Tae-hun,
from start to finish.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:11.147
He has good intuition,
so he read all the cards by himself...

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:14.184
Guys, I skimmed through all 110 cards.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.819
QUICKLY MASTERED THE CONTENT OF 110 CARDS

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.921
Since we had quite a lot of cards,

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:23.326
I thought it would be too time-consuming
to systematically categorize them.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.896
I realized the importance
of intuition in the game.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:31.868
He went through the cards alone
and told us the profession of each person.

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:35.071
We have a writer,
a security guard, an actor,

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.539
and an engineer.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.576
HE CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED
THE SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS IN ONE GO

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:40.510
PASSCODE IS 18751879

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.512
TEAM SKKU OPENED THE SAFE FIRST

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.047
It's freaking unbelievable.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:48.685
PHOTO OF THE VICTIM, ADAM THE CEO

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:52.956
PHOTOS OF THE 8 SUSPECTS

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.924
AND 20 PHOTOS FROM A SECURITY CAMERA

01:04:55.291 --> 01:05:00.897
WHEN ARRANGED IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE,
THESE PHOTOS WILL REVEAL THE TRUTH

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:05.535
We will now begin Round 2
of Signal Investigation 3.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:08.671
You will be given 1 hour and 30 minutes.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.877
Let's focus on the jobs
and start matching them.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:16.679
- Yes, exactly.
- We've lost focus on the jobs.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.615
MUST COMPLETE THE ROUND 1 TASK
TO TACKLE ROUND 2

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.284
Team SKKU completed Round 1 very early,

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:24.954
whereas we had almost nothing confirmed.

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.290
Does that make no sense grammatically?

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.726
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S ONLY GUIDE
WAS GRAMMATICAL ELEMENTS

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.061
None of us felt comfortable
requesting a new action plan

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.464
with respect to the plan we made
during the strategy meeting.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.433
...on the suspect information was correct.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.600
They're so fast.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.171
Team SKKU's quick success
with the Round 1 task

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:47.444
drove us to take up a new approach boldly.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:51.481
Let's sort out the cards
based on the clues we gathered so far.

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.749
- Agreed.
- Good idea.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:55.251
HARRY, FOR HIS NEW BOOK
I think A-32 and B-13 are a match.

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.420
JENNIFER, UPLOAD SCHEDULE
Here's another set. A-14 and B-6.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:58.788
Is it about Jennifer?

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:01.324
Okay, we're on the right path. Good job.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:02.892
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE PICKS UP THE PACE

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.629
DYLAN TOOK A SLICE OF FRUIT CAKE...
I think Dylan may be a chef.

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.898
Adam wanted to replace his chef
and fired Dylan.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.099
Great job.

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:13.203
- "Dylan protested..."
- He was wrongfully dismissed!

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.638
Basically, Dylan was Adam's subordinate.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.640
- Exactly.
- Adam was his boss.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:22.011
DYLAN WAS A CHEF
WORKING ON ADAM'S SPACECRAFT

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.614
I think Christopher works for Adam, too.

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:27.383
Maybe not, but he wanted to talk to Adam
for being overlooked for promotion.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.019
Do we have more leads
about Frank and Christopher?

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.521
I'll look for them.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:34.290
TEAM KAIST HAS IDENTIFIED
MOST SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.959
EXCEPT FOR CHRISTOPHER AND FRANK

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.195
We thought Dylan might be in security
because we knew he was on Adam's payroll.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.530
It's almost a certainty.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.199
- Only the security guard fits the bill.
- All right, then.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.701
I'll put a circle here.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.003
Who do we have left now?

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.638
Christopher and Frank.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.139
Match chef and manager...

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.208
- With those two guys. Got it.
- Exactly.

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:56.779
Are we sure Dylan is the security guard?

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.515
He's got to be the chef.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.250
- How come?
- What makes you say that?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.785
Just look.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.655
Adam asked Dylan to delay
his usual tea delivery by ten minutes.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:08.258
Dylan has to be the chef.

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:11.227
Maybe Edward works in security.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:14.264
But we know Edward has a manager.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.065
Frank is the rookie, right?

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.835
Frank is the rookie,
and Edward has a manager.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:23.806
Doesn't that make Frank
an up-and-coming actor?

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.808
CHRISTOPHER AND FRANK: N/A

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.911
Maybe Frank is the manager?

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:29.512
The rookie Frank somehow enraged Edward.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:33.049
- Frank is a rookie actor.
- A rookie actor?

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:36.419
- We still have an issue.
- The manager and the rookie actor...

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.821
REMAINING JOBS:
ROOKIE ACTOR, MANAGER, SECURITY GUARD

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.924
I don't think the manager
is in the suspect pool.

01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:41.858
Frank is an actor, then.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.593
Where did this manager come from?

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:47.530
One card mentions
Edward complaining to his manager.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:51.200
But the manager can have
nothing to do with the murder.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:55.772
- One mention doesn't make you a suspect.
- The manager might not be on Space 7.

01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:57.607
We have two actors in the suspect pool?

01:07:58.141 --> 01:07:59.142
That seems likely.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:00.710
FRANK: ROOKIE ACTOR
CHRISTOPHER: SECURITY GUARD

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:02.912
I think Edward and Frank may be actors.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.449
This card says Edward was enraged
at the rookie Frank for a reason.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.484
We can match these two, no?

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:09.953
EDWARD WAS ENRAGED AT THE ROOKIE FRANK...

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:10.954
...FOR TAKING HIS ROLE

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:13.022
- We have two actors.
- See? I told you.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.325
But the veteran
was replaced by the rookie.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.459
That seems to be it.

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:20.797
EDWARD AND FRANK ARE ACTORS
WHO BOARDED SPACE 7 TO SHOOT A COMMERCIAL

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:22.432
CHRISTOPHER

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:25.335
TEAM KAIST ONLY HAS TO DEDUCE
CHRISTOPHER'S PROFESSION

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:29.706
Because we were making steady progress,
I thought we could come in second.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:33.710
In essence, being overlooked for promotion
means not becoming the head of security.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.279
I think Christopher is the security guard.

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:37.814
That's the only possibility.

01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:39.182
- Got it.
- Great.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:43.086
CHRISTOPHER IS A SECURITY GUARD ON SPACE 7

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.789
TEAM KAIST SUBMITS THEIR FINDINGS
ABOUT THE SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:49.659
Team KAIST's submission
on the suspect information

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.828
was correct.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.464
...on the suspect information was correct.

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.800
THE WINNER IS DECIDED
BY EACH DIVISION'S TOTAL TIME SPENT

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.002
...was correct.

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:00.470
They did it.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.205
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE GROWS IMPATIENT

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.173
That added a sense of urgency.

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:07.110
I thought that I should be more alert.

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:11.648
We have to rearrange them, right?
Can you sort these out in order of events?

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:16.352
20 PHOTOS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA
ARE MIXED RANDOMLY OUT OF ORDER

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:20.623
THEY CAN FIND THE CULPRIT BY COMBINING
INFORMATION FROM THE PHOTOS AND THE CARDS

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.026
"While leaving Adam's cabin, Frank..."

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.327
Why was he there anyway?

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:27.463
PHOTO OF FRANK
STANDING OUTSIDE OF ADAM'S CABIN

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.400
Pretty much all the suspects visited Adam.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.004
CHRISTOPHER THE SECURITY GUARD
DISCOVERED ADAM'S CORPSE

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:39.409
SUSPECTS SEEN LEAVING ADAM'S CABIN
ARE AS FOLLOWS

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:42.412
EDWARD THE ACTOR

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:45.415
JENNIFER THE YOUTUBER

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.418
HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.952
GABRIEL THE PHYSICIAN AND RESEARCHER

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.522
Why was Gabriel there?
Was there a mention of him going in?

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:55.591
Adam was trying to push
the launch of the new drug,

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.795
so the physician and researcher, Gabriel,
wanted to stop that.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.396
GABRIEL'S PERSUASION ATTEMPT

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:03.166
So Adam and Gabriel didn't get along.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:06.135
- Everyone would have beef with him.
- Of course.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.237
Everyone has to have a motive for murder.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.240
By the way,
multiple people were out to kill Adam.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:15.078
- Yeah, there's a handful.
- Exactly. He made a lot of enemies.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:20.283
SUSPECTS WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST ADAM

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.619
These are just smoke screens.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:27.423
Many cards mentioned people
being upset by Adam's actions.

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:31.527
But I thought those were just
game devices to trick us.

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:35.631
I believed that our investigation
should be based on solid evidence.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:40.403
Dong-yeon, out of the events in the cards
that you have been reviewing up to now,

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:44.006
can you tell me the ones
we know exactly when they happened?

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:47.043
This happened at 10:50 p.m.,
and that happened at 11:10 p.m.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.478
These are all between that time.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.214
- Let me take notes.
- Okay.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.548
ANALYZING THE TIME DATA

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.653
I thought we needed
the estimated time of death first.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.457
TEAM SKKU TRIES TO PINPOINT
ADAM'S TIME OF DEATH

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.326
When did Adam have his chamomile tea?

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.596
One of the cards mentioned
the time of the usual delivery.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.132
Found it. The chef has
to give him the tea at 10 p.m.

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:12.902
- The delivery was made at 10:10 p.m.
- At 10:10 p.m.

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:16.906
AT 10:10 P.M., DYLAN THE CHEF BROUGHT
TEA AND CAKE TO ADAM'S CABIN

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.343
Look. Harry had an appointment
with Adam at 10:55 p.m.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.278
to gather material for his new book.

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:26.282
AT 10:55 P.M., HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER
VISITED ADAM TO INTERVIEW HIM

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.618
We could use a timeline on the board.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.686
- Okay, one second.
- Let's use that to catch our killer.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.989
The solar flare occurred at 11:10 p.m.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.893
AT 11:10 P.M., BELLA THE ENGINEER HAD
TO EXAMINE EQUIPMENT DUE TO A SOLAR FLARE

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.262
EMERGENCY LIGHT WAS ON AT 11:10 P.M.

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:42.832
Team SNU in STEM's submission
on the suspect information was incorrect.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.534
Please try again.

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.936
Chin up, guys!

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:50.139
We still don't know
if Frank is an actor or a manager.

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.340
We're sure about this.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.775
ONE MORE FAILURE
WILL TRIGGER A 10-MINUTE PENALTY

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.143
Well, about Frank...

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:59.015
We wrongly assumed
that everyone had a different profession.

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:02.185
I'm still haunted by the conundrum
of Edward and Frank both being actors.

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:04.387
How do we resolve this?

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:07.290
This card says he valued his integrity
as a physician and researcher.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.992
I think this physician and researcher
must be Gabriel.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.030
ONLY BELLA'S PROFESSION
IS LEFT UNDETERMINED

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:18.034
WHICH TEAM SNU WILL SUCCEED
IN DEDUCING THE PROFESSIONS FIRST?

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.403
Team SNU in Medicine's submission

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:24.006
on the suspect information was correct.

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.275
...on the suspect information was correct.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.577
- There we go!
- See?

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.345
- You were right.
- He's an actor.

01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:34.483
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
OBTAINED ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:38.487
These photos are a treasure trove.

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:41.958
I was convinced
the photos would give us key leads.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.360
When I studied them closely,

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:47.563
I noticed that focusing on items
placed on the trolley alone

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:50.066
told us the basic timeline.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:53.502
9 PHOTOS WITH THE TROLLEY

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:57.907
A CUP OF CHAMOMILE TEA ON THE TROLLEY

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.377
PHOTOS WHERE THE CUP IS FULL

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.881
PHOTOS WHERE THE CUP IS EMPTY

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:09.151
We could get the perfect sequence
of events based on that alone.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:13.022
ORDER OF EVENTS ARRANGED
BY THE CUP OF CHAMOMILE TEA

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:25.735
I examined the photos alone
while my teammates reviewed the cards.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:30.339
Then I shared the information I learned
with my teammates.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.809
Type in actor next to Frank.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.212
Edward is an actor, and so is Frank.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:39.582
Why did we think
one of them had to be a manager?

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.084
We believed
that one of the suspects was a manager,

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.954
but we realized our mistake later on.

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:48.557
The manager was only a recipient
of Edward's text messages.

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:51.127
We finally corrected our mistake.

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:54.463
Team SNU in STEM's submission
on the suspect information was correct.

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.799
- See? That did the trick.
- Darn it.

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.402
No, it's okay. We can catch up with them.

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:03.739
One, eight, seven, five,
one, eight, seven, nine, hash.

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.076
We can still turn it around.

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:10.212
I'll place all the matched pairs
on this side.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.815
I think this happened first.

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:15.618
- Frank and Edward's visit.
- How so? On what grounds?

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:17.453
First off...

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:19.155
Dylan heard Gabriel's voice.

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:20.623
DYLAN SAID HE HEARD GABRIEL'S VOICE
IN ADAM'S ROOM

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.925
That would be because Gabriel was inside.

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.660
- Dylan heard Gabriel's voice?
- Yes.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:27.396
So he decided to leave the items outside.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.531
Then, Gabriel came out.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.966
GABRIEL THE PHYSICIAN LEFT ADAM'S CABIN

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:30.866
In this exact sequence.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.068
The actors went in. Frank left.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.103
Gabriel went in as Edward left.
Then, he left.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.973
To explain the trolley,
Dylan should've come before Gabriel left.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.545
Let's remove the unlikely suspects.
Frank couldn't have done it.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.080
He returned to his cabin.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.614
WHEN EDWARD ASKED FOR PRIVACY,
FRANK RETURNED TO HIS CABIN

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.451
- The YouTuber didn't do it, either.
- No?

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.452
Adam was still alive.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:51.287
Hey, that's right.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:52.254
He was alive.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.856
ADAM PLACED THE EMPTY CUP ON THE TROLLEY
AFTER JENNIFER LEFT

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.858
Dylan can't have done it, either.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.694
No one answered the door,
so he didn't enter the cabin.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:04.100
DYLAN, JENNIFER, AND FRANK ARE EXCLUDED

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.501
One thing's for certain.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.838
Adam was alive until Dylan returned
to collect the trolley.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:11.040
- That's true.
- He was seen leaving his cup outside.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.111
GABRIEL IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE HE LEFT
BEFORE THE TROLLEY WAS REMOVED

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:18.681
GABRIEL IS EXCLUDED

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.984
Don't you think Adam's face
could be deep purple from suffocation?

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:23.119
It makes sense, no?

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:28.124
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ASPHYXIATION

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.726
That's a match.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.661
- He must've died around 11:05 p.m.
- Around 11:05 p.m.?

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.563
That's when someone lowered
the oxygen level to 10%.

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:37.400
By the way, who adjusted the oxygen level?

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:41.037
"Only the engineers verified by biometrics
can make remote adjustments."

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.738
Wasn't Bella the engineer?

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.006
Can she have done it?

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:46.842
DID BELLA THE ENGINEER MURDER ADAM?

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.578
What happens
when the oxygen level is lowered?

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.047
People die.

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:53.315
When the oxygen level goes below 10%...

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:56.185
See? If that state continues
for ten minutes, people die.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:57.787
That should last for at least ten minutes.

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:00.623
Okay, here's my take.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.691
Someone lowered
the oxygen level at 11:05 p.m.

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:05.227
The emergency lamp lit up
because of the solar flare at 11:10 p.m.,

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:08.597
- so the tampering occurred before that.
- Oh, then it couldn't have killed him.

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:12.435
Once the emergency light is on,
all cabin settings are reset.

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:15.805
When that happens,
the oxygen level returns to 21%.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:19.208
There is no way the oxygen level
remained low for more than ten minutes.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.210
Low oxygen level
wasn't the cause of death.

01:16:21.277 --> 01:16:25.648
SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE LOW OXYGEN LEVEL
CAUSED ADAM'S ASPHYXIATION

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.383
My money is on Harry.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.584
- The killer?
- Yes.

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.719
- Why?
- I'm not sure yet. Give me a minute.

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:33.656
Harry's movements are
too disconnected from the other events.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:36.659
I know. There is no lead
pinpointing when he came or left.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:40.229
NO OTHER PEOPLE OR ITEMS
ARE SHOWN IN HARRY'S PHOTOS

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.099
Team SKKU's submission...

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:48.070
on the culprit...

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.841
was correct.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:56.779
Did Adam die
because of the low oxygen level?

01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:57.780
No.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.216
Someone snuffed the life out of him.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.851
Adam fought back.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:05.688
We know he managed to scratch the killer
from the blood under his nail.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.824
We should take a closer look
at the injured people.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:11.627
Those with a visible scar
are Edward, Harry, and Bella.

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.996
3 SUSPECTS WITH A SCAR

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.832
Edward met the physician at 10:50 p.m.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.635
He couldn't have been hurt by Adam.

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:24.773
EDWARD IS EXCLUDED AS HE LEFT THE CABIN
WHEN ADAM WAS STILL ALIVE

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.643
The killer was inside Adam's cabin.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:31.046
BELLA THE ENGINEER
NEVER CAME OUT OF ADAM'S CABIN

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.682
When we removed suspects
from our pool one by one,

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:34.984
only Harry remained.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.585
SOLE REMAINING SUSPECT WITH A SCAR
HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.621
HARRY VISITED ADAM AT 10:55 P.M.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.022
ADAM WASN'T HURT BEFORE HE MET HARRY

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.490
Harry had to be our guy.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:45.494
Not everyone has an alibi,

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.963
but based on the evidence,
only Harry fits the bill.

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:50.733
- Let's submit our answer.
- Okay, I'll do it.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:53.369
Please be right.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:54.637
WHO IS THE CULPRIT?
HARRY

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:57.873
Team SKKU's submission...

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.178
on the culprit was correct.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:04.914
TEAM SKKU IS THE FIRST
TO APPREHEND THE CULPRIT

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.816
IT TOOK THEM 41 MINUTES AND 37 SECONDS

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.451
- Good job.
- What the heck, Tae-hun?

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.654
- My gosh, Tae-hun...
- You're our hidden ace.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.556
You were amazing. Kudos.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:17.226
I think the four of us
can take on any team

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:19.929
in games where all members participate.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.764
The culprit has to be Harry.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.566
- Why?
- Consider the timeline.

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:26.735
I think we got the timeline correctly.
This far, that is.

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.337
Only Harry was seen leaving Adam's cabin.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.339
After that, there was no time
for anyone to go back in.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.675
The emergency light turned on
at 11:10 p.m.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:34.376
HARRY LEFT BEFORE 11:10 P.M.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.478
- Do we type in Harry?
- Yes, we've got to.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.547
Team SKKU up and did it,
and our guys will need more time.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:39.648
I'll go with Harry.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.050
SUBMITTED HARRY AS THE CULPRIT

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.685
Oh, please. Let's pray, guys.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:47.656
Team KAIST's submission on the culprit

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.325
was correct.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.694
TEAM KAIST APPREHENDED THE CULPRIT

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.764
THEY TOOK 46 MINUTES AND 25 SECONDS,
ROUGHLY 5 MINUTES MORE THAN TEAM SKKU

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.935
- Good job, Team KAIST.
- They're fast.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.705
Team SNU in Medicine
has to beat the other Team SNU.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.206
If Team SNU in STEM finishes first,

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.941
our guys have to follow
in less than five minutes.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.142
That's right.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.245
Let's hope for Team SNU in STEM's success.

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:10.446
Come on, guys.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:14.350
We have to pray for Team SNU in Medicine.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.986
They'll do fine.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:20.222
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE VS TEAM SNU IN STEM

01:19:20.623 --> 01:19:22.458
Shall I gather the cards with time?

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:24.927
Collect all the cards
that have numbers on them.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.596
According to these,
Adam always replied within five minutes.

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.299
When Adam was still around,
he would reply to any messages

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:33.302
- No reply suggests...
- within five minutes.

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:34.737
These are also important.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.772
Bella received an answer
to her 11 p.m. text.

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:38.974
That means Adam was still alive at 11 p.m.

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:43.779
"Blood likely belonging to the culprit..."
That must be the culprit's.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.781
We have to know more about this blood.

01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:47.149
Who got injured earlier?

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:48.584
Someone bled, didn't they?

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:50.619
- Who was it?
- Harry.

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:53.489
Harry is probably the one
who entered the cabin last.

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.424
My gut says he did it.

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.760
- It's very likely.
- Let's try our luck.

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:00.429
- What if he did it?
- Hang on!

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.565
HAN SEO-YEON AND JOO MIN-SEO POINT
THE SAME PERSON AT THE SAME TIME

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.001
We don't know when he left.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.338
He's the only person who could've been
in Adam's cabin in the time window.

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:10.973
It's Harry.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.775
- Murder solved!
- I think you got it.

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.276
- I'll go with Harry.
- Do it.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.111
- Tell me what to do.
- Do it!

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.479
Okay. One, two, three.

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:18.414
CULPRIT'S NAME SUBMITTED

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.483
Let's go with Harry. If it's not him,
we'll accept the Deathmatch.

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:25.054
CULPRIT'S NAME SUBMITTED

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.223
Suppose Harry is our killer.
What's his motive?

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.059
- What's his motive?
- I wonder.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.994
Same. That's what I'm dying to know.

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:34.697
Here's an idea.

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:37.833
Harry's bestselling book
was based on a murder case.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.636
- What if he's an actual murderer?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:43.539
So his novel was based on a true crime?

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:46.342
Yes, but he'd be the one
carrying out the crimes.

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:50.813
He told his editor that the manuscript
would be ready after his trip.

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.147
He's a nutjob.

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:55.150
- Yes, he's a weirdo.
- Right. He assured his editor, see?

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:58.253
That concludes Signal Investigation 3.

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.456
CULPRIT APPREHENDED

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.891
The result will now be announced.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.628
Team SKKU apprehended the culprit

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.731
in 41 minutes and 37 seconds.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.901
Team KAIST apprehended the culprit

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.937
in 46 minutes and 25 seconds.

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:21.110
Team SNU in Medicine and Team SNU in STEM

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.745
apprehended the culprit.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.646
Now, for the final results.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.016
Medical Division
took 99 minutes and 8 seconds in total.

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.251
STEM Division...

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:34.390
STEM Division

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.558
took 106 minutes and 36 seconds in total.

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.762
Medical Division won the match.

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:41.530
MEDICAL DIVISION
WINS SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 3

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:42.664
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.766
TEAM SKKU

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:44.900
TEAM SNU IN STEM

01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:46.034
TEAM KAIST

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:49.271
Team SKKU managed to deliver
good performances back-to-back.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.507
That filled me with pride.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:55.244
I thought it was such a relief
to have Team SKKU in my division.

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:59.214
I was pleased
that my team survived another day.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:04.253
In light of STEM Division's defeat,
Team SNU in STEM and Team KAIST,

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:07.423
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.060
We lost face to Team KAIST big time.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:15.130
If we had apprehended the culprit
faster than Team SKKU,

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:18.434
we could've advanced
regardless of Team SNU in STEM's results.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:21.003
It's such a shame we hadn't.

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:23.338
We promised
to advance to the finals together.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.474
It was heartbreaking
to see our dream shatter.

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:29.945
But I told myself that the experience
of the Deathmatch would strengthen us.

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.948
Today's Deathmatch is

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:35.017
Lucky 21.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.251
It's a memorization game.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.619
Let's go get them.

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:40.022
We have to carry the torch
for STEM Division.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.825
KAIST is the best in STEM.
We can't lose this match.

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.259
Excuse me.

01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:45.961
We're splitting the prize, remember?

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.565
Why does Team KAIST look so relaxed?

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:52.334
They've experienced this before.

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:54.670
- We can win and be done with it.
- Sure.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.506
We'll now begin Round 1 of the Deathmatch.

01:22:57.606 --> 01:22:58.907
The match we've been waiting for.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:01.677
- I'll obtain it.
- I'll take a pass.

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:04.913
I'm a wreck now. I can't stand this.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.114
Hang on.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.983
What was that?

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:09.318
I guess something went wrong.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.019
That was a mistake.

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.287
I'll obtain it.

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.501
