00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.760
News of the Xies' break
with the Chen royal family

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.480
has spread.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.519
King Liang has made his move.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.280
It's all under control.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.799
Everything

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:20.560
will proceed exactly as you wish.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.879
Seventeenth Prince,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.319
haven't you gotten what you wanted?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.239
The title of Crown Prince of Qi State

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.480
is now secure.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.239
Your Majesty,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.079
your heart is truly merciless.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.852
(One year later, Imperial Study)

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.879
King Liang of Qi State

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.200
believed Chen State would weaken
after losing

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.719
the Xie and Huo families.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.040
Little did he know he fell
into your scheme.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.319
Since last month's battle
at Poshan Pass,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.480
Qi's elite forces
have been utterly decimated.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.000
Our lost territories

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.840
will surely be reclaimed shortly.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.159
After the Sheng army's name was cleared,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.920
their morale has soared higher.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.719
Since the Grand Princess returned,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.000
the Chen court has been
profoundly shaken.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.439
Many neighboring states

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.439
all submitted memorials
expressing goodwill.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.719
This way,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.360
King Liang poses little threat now.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.319
Everything is normal on Sister's end?

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.560
Yes.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.199
I occasionally go
to organize her incense.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.599
The Grand Princess still prays
day and night.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:40.840
Furthermore,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.280
she has lit an eternal lamp.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.280
She still refuses to see me.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.759
Everyone in the palace knows

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.360
you cherish the Grand Princess most.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.120
For over a year now,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.599
you've scoured for treasures
to send to Weiyang Palace.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680
Maybe

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.000
the Grand Princess
remains melancholic...

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.960
(It's been a year.)

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.319
(How naive I was)

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.879
(to believe Sister can let him go)

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.879
(and accept me.)

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.639
(This was merely my own longing.)

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.840
(My Late Husband Xie Fei)
(After I left in my previous life,)

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.919
(Huaiyong, what state of mind
were you in?)

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.319
(Now I finally understand it all.)

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.439
Your Highness,

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.840
good news for Chen State.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.319
Victories keep coming along the border
against Qi State.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.800
They will soon sue for peace.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.439
We will reclaim its lost lands.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.520
Chen State...

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.919
Chen State approaches
a golden age of prosperity.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.719
Both palace insiders and outsiders say

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.439
His Majesty is truly a wise ruler.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.560
(Huaiyong,)

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.960
(did you hear this?)

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.199
(Within this palace and court,)

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.240
(nothing remains to hold my concern.)

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.759
Her Highness locked the door.
Refusing all visitors.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.079
This is utterly agonizing.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.560
Did she say anything?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.060
Well...

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.240
She kept repeating

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.079
that "Nothing remains
to hold her concern."

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.480
Could she

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.079
have taken her own life?

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:27.204
(Weiyang Palace)

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.720
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.959
What are you waiting for? Break it down!

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:31.920
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.279
Sister,

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.120
is Xie Fei truly that important?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.839
While you were gone,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.959
did you ever think of me,

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.040
waiting for you in this palace?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.920
You've resided in Weiyang Palace
for over a year,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.839
yet refused to see me.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.439
I wish you'd

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.000
look at me like you used to.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.040
I wish we could

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.759
live together eternally in the palace.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.000
Sister,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.480
now with all matters settled,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.079
if you desire regency authority,

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.160
I'll grant it now.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.439
Should you accept,

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.439
I offer the throne as a gift

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.839
and name you Empress.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.600
Do you truly believe
I covet this throne?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.519
I once stood atop power's pinnacle,

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.680
surveying all below.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.720
I've also been trampled underfoot,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.959
brought near death's edge.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.040
I was forged within life's tempests,

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.879
never knowing a moment's peace.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.759
This past year, I often wondered.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.959
What purpose does my existence
truly serve?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.079
In my youth,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
I was cherished by everyone.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.279
I lived only to see
the vast sky and sea,

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.319
free and unrestrained.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.079
Then came a time

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.879
when Chen Ye betrayed us.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.360
When we fell to Yeyou Court,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.120
I ceased living for myself.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.319
The cold waters of Yeyou Court

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
washed away all my willfulness.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.279
I lived for you.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.519
Later, when I rose to power,

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.959
I lived for Chen State.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.439
After Weiyang Palace coup,

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.160
by heaven's grace, I was reborn.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.120
I lived for revenge.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.319
Only Huaiyong...

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.199
Only before him

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.759
could I be my true self.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
But he died.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.759
He died.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.160
He died.

(Deep in the Rainy Alley of Jiangnan)

I was wrong.

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.864
(For Grand Tutor Xie Only)

00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:47.440

Your Majesty.

You'll be busy for a while.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.240
So the fact is

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.720
you feigned poisoning.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.360
Xie Fei faked his death

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.200
and led troops to battle.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:02.279
First,

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:03.639
it flushed out the palace faction.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:04.840
Second,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.759
it put down King Liang on the border.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.360
Brilliant strategy!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.240
If word gets out,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840
I won't stay uninvolved

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.480
in Qi State's affairs.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.840
Okay.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.240
I've been played

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.399
by you and your sister.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:37.279
(Securing peace at home
and abroad is my sister's wish.)

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.360
(The Grand Princess sacrificed herself
for the realm.)

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.840
(She passed suddenly.)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.360
(My heart grieves deeply.)

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.120
(To honor her legacy,)

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.799
(I decree amnesty.)

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.120
(This expresses my sorrow.)

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.639
(May the Grand Princess's spirit)

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.240
