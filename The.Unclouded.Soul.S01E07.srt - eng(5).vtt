[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670
[Episode 7]

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.759
I'll take them all.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.710
Please deliver them
to the magistrate's office.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.390
No problem.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.310
You are...

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.320
What are you doing here?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.560
Why are you and the Feiyu Guard
going to Misty Forest again?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.090
It's none of your business.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.830
Protecting the demons
is my responsibility.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.470
You are

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.730
no exception.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.380
Who do you think you are?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.230
Coming and going

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.070
as you please.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.630
I, Xiao Yao, have been wandering
the martial world for a long time.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.820
I don't need anyone's protection.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.500
Let me go!

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.850
Xiao Yao.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.130
Stop making a fuss.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.100
Me? Making a fuss?

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.030
Fine.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.630
I'm the one making a fuss.
It's all my fault.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.890
Can you release me now?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.260
It's really dangerous
for you to go in alone.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.540
It's none of your business!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.210
Let go!

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.190
Xiao Yao.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.030
The Misty Forest
is the mountain elves' lair.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.579
That masked man
is the rare thousand-year mountain elf.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.540
He is neither human nor demon,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.540
existing outside the Three Realms.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.190
You can't handle him alone.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.720
A mountain elf?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.660
Come back with me.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.120
I'll explain everything.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.650
My Lord.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.690
Do you still want the rope?

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.820
Where's that girl from just now?

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.980
She left with that gentleman.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.640
Gentleman?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.420
What kind of gentleman?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.480
How was he dressed?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.170
He was tall

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.620
with fair skin.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.390
Tan'er, the great demon
is right before us.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.790
Can't you sense it?

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.230
Twenty years ago,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.950
the Hefeng Tribe rose to power
in the Northern Prairie.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.470
The tribe leader,
imitating the Emperor of Tiansheng,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.180
sent a fleet to search
for the Penglang Celestial Mountain.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.030
But the fleet encountered a storm at sea.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.070
Only one small boat remained,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.270
drifting aimlessly.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680
By chance, it reached Penglang

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.260
and found the Yuli Spring.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.260
The crew on the boat

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.980
were all loyal warriors
of the Hefeng Tribe,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.100
extremely faithful,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.630
who dared not drink it themselves

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.540
but wanted to bring it back
to their leader.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.260
Little did they know
that on their way back,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.100
they encountered another storm,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.579
which blew their boat
into Tiansheng territory.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.510
The Emperor of Tiansheng

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.510
wouldn't miss such an opportunity.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.870
He immediately mobilized the Feiyu Guard
and various sects

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.820
to seize

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.140
the Yuli Spring at all costs.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.840
You have all been deceived!

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.880
The spring water

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.490
is the tears of a demon,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.660
drawing out the raw essence
of human nature and desire.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.250
What you call immortality

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.519
is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.000
an eternity of suffering!

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.400
The Hefeng Tribe was slaughtered.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.820
But one young warrior survived.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.409
For revenge,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.130
he swallowed mud mixed with water
from the Yuli Spring,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.190
prayed to demons for power,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.080
and transformed into a mountain elf.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.950
Why do you know so much about this

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.080
as if you've seen it with your own eyes?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.950
It's all recorded in the Baize Drawings.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.010
You didn't do your research properly

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.820
and you have the nerve to ask?

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.200
[Taotie]

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.340
[Mountain Elf]

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.340
He killed many people

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.310
for revenge.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.380
Many sect leaders died by his hand.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.010
He has a blood feud with humans

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.070
but nothing with demons.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.070
Later, all major sects
were forced to unite.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.040
And rumors about the elf
gradually disappeared.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.300
We thought he was dead.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.510
Unexpectedly,
he's been hiding in the Misty Forest

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.570
living eternally.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.880
All his loved ones are dead.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.120
What's the use of immortality?

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.670
Each day must feel like a year to him,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.870
unbearably painful.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.190
It's not surprising that he kidnapped

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.900
the Qionghua sect leader's daughter.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.560
This is the consequence
of humans' own actions.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.740
No.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.630
The grievances of the previous generation

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.820
shouldn't fall on the next.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.430
No matter how deep the elf's hatred is,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.290
that girl shouldn't be involved.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.140
This matter doesn't concern demons.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.990
Demons never enter
the Misty Forest either.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.220
Even if someone needs to be rescued,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.700
humans should save their own.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.870
Xiao Mu, be quiet!

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.140
My Lord, I...

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.310
My Lord.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.920
My Lord, you really cannot go.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.900
If it's about Luoluo and Dali,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.630
all the more reason
you don't need to get involved.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.580
I can resolve this
with one trip to Pingjiang.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.830
A mere mountain elf

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900
is no match for me.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.780
Why are you trying so hard to stop me?

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.040
All the demon subjects

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.190
hope you can become powerful again,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.310
leading us to find the Yuli Spring.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.650
If you go to save humans

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.470
at this critical moment,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.140
do you really want Hei Wu
to get the Demon Heart?

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.400
Luoluo and Dali are trapped among humans

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.860
in danger because of this.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.170
If we abandon them,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.990
how can we restore the Demon Heart?

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.310
No.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.810
My Lord, you cannot go.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.130
No, no!

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.750
My Lord!

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:54.800
You cannot go!

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.360
Xiao Yao.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.570
Step aside.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.070
If you won't save them,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.110
I'll go myself.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.950
You don't need to worry about me.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.820
I have my own plan.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.480
Move aside.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.630
I won't worry about you.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.030
I'll listen to your plan.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.590
I'll do whatever you say.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.890
What's in this bag?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.810
The smell is so strong.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.320
It's so stinky.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.030
Of course dried fish stinks.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.420
But it can lure cats out.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.610
We can bring the leftovers back
for Xiao Ming.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.740
He'll like them too.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.830
Are you sure?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.700
What about this hemp rope?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.570
What's it for?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.910
We can't go in together

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.460
so we don't frighten the girl.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.340
I'll go in first.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.220
If I encounter any danger,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.550
I'll tug the rope twice.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.740
If I don't pull the rope,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.740
it means it's safe,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.340
and you can let the rope down.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.150
Xiao Yao.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.870
Why don't

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.160
you wait for me here?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.990
I'll go bring that girl back.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.030
How will you bring her?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.560
Kidnap her like the elf did?

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.700
Fine.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.700
I won't say anything more.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.030
Let's follow your plan.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.220
That's our only option anyway.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.580
Since the jade pendant was taken back,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.910
we can't use the summoning spell anymore.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.450
Let me do it.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.670
Don't tie it too loose,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.800
or it might fall off.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.500
Don't tie it too tight either.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.460
I'm afraid of being strangled.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.460
I haven't even started tying it yet.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.470
Then hurry up.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.150
Done.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.990
Xiao Yao!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.420
Be careful.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.150
Kitty.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.090
Little Kitty.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.310
Xiao Yao!

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.070
It loves these dried fish the most.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.270
You can feed it these.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.860
Nobody ever comes here,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.030
it's so lonely.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.850
It's so nice that you're here.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.820
Xiao Yao.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.210
Why did you come in?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.630
Weren't you supposed to wait outside?

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.820
I noticed something strange with the rope,

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.820
so I came to check.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.740
You were worried I might be in danger.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.190
No,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.900
you were worried
my face might be in danger.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.540
Earlier, Flower Lady ran away,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.150
and I came out with Li to look for it.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.220
He said he was in the forest

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.680
and encountered a couple,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.960
whom he frightened.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.960
He was talking

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.590
about you two, wasn't he?

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.280
Since we've found the person,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.080
let's go back.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.080
Why such a hurry?

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.820
Why?

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.570
I came to this place by my own choice.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.980
Li knows medicine

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.440
and can heal my eyes.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.150
In just a few more days,

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.950
my eyes will be able to see again.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.030
Please tell my parents

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.550
that there's a very nice person
taking care of me

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.010
and they shouldn't worry.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.020
You don't believe me?

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.820
Let me take you to Li

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.530
so he can tell you himself.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.510
Which way?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.800
This way.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:02.750
Let's go.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:03.700
Wait.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.620
Ignore him.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.190
Let's go.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.860
Every plant and tree here

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.320
is Li's friend.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.060
We're here. It's right here.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.320
Let's go.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.310
I know you're annoyed.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.440
Li.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.680
Li, we have visitors.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.090
Li.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.910
Li.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.310
He was just here

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.730
but now he's gone again.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.950
Don't touch that!

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.130
Li.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.980
I brought two friends to see you.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.190
My parents noticed I was missing

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.800
and got worried,
so they sent them to find me.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.550
Why are you wearing a mask again?

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.610
Didn't we agree you wouldn't wear it?

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.180
Flower Lady.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.460
Don't be scared.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.430
Don't be scared.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.220
Thank you.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.970
Can't you see?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.270
I've been blind since childhood.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.470
I can't see anything.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.790
What happened

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.590
to your hand?

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.220
My hand...

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.520
is gone.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.690
You're so pitiful.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.750
Let me touch your face.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.460
I should at least know

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.190
what the person
who saved Flower Lady looks like.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.070
Why...

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.840
Why do you wear a mask?

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.300
I'm ugly.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.930
I can't see.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.480
You don't need to wear
a mask in front of me.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.550
What's your name?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.430
Li.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.860
Li.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.600
My name is Yunyi.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.790
My parents always say
it's dangerous outside.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.520
They never let me go out to play.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.960
This time they brought me to Pingjiang,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.200
but I'm still trapped indoors all day.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.620
Li.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.650
Take me out to play.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.740
Otherwise, when my parents wake up,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.400
I won't be able to go out again.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.450
Li, please,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.730
take me out to play.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.090
This place feels so different

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.800
from where I live.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.390
It smells so nice.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.970
Old Pagoda.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.720
You tripped my friend.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.560
Is there someone else here?

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.560
Old Pagoda is this big tree beside you,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.300
an old friend of mine.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.970
Then,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.150
take me to greet your old friend.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.230
Let's go.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.770
Your good friend must be very tall,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.810
very big,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.200
with many birds
making homes in its branches.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.420
From now on,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.369
Old Pagoda,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.890
you're my good friend too.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.750
It seems like it's talking.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.110
It says your eyes

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.780
can actually see.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.030
Really?

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.020
You can understand what it's saying?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.060
It also says

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.670
you just need the first dewdrop

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.070
from the forest at sunrise
to wash your eyes

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.430
for half a month continuously,
and you'll be cured.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.390
That means

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.560
I can hang out here for half a month.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.520
Great!

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.640
Your family will be worried.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.430
It's fine.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.630
My parents are usually very busy.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.110
They don't have time for me.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.820
Besides,

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.590
if my eyes are really cured,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.850
they'll be overjoyed.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.220
Good.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.110
From now on,
come with me daily to collect morning dew.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.960
Wonderful!

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.330
If my eyes really heal,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.260
I'll see my parents with my own eyes,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.190
then look at you,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.160
and see all the beautiful sights
in this vast world.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.270
Your face must be good looking,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.880
but you always wear a mask.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.460
Since the first time I met you,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.790
you've been wearing it.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.310
Xiao Yao, Hong Ye,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.540
please tell me,

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.870
is Li's face good looking?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.120
Yes, it is.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.430
I knew it.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.000
Yunyi, go sit in the sunshine for a while.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.390
It will be good for your eyes.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.850
Mm-hmm.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.260
Xiao Yao, come on.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.400
I'll take you to have some fun.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.120
Let's go.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.090
Demon King.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.590
You are the mountain elf.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.160
Did you kill the human ladies

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.140
by the lake?

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.790
No.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.480
Who did then?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.840
Find out yourself.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.350
You're a Demon King.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.640
Why did you come to my forest

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.950
these many times?

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.590
I'm here to look
for that little girl just now.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.010
A demon like you

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.580
is meddling in human affairs?

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.830
Why do you

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.670
keep her here?

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.040
To heal her eyes.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.810
Do you know she's the only daughter
of Qionghua's sect leader?

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.300
Years ago,
all major sects and the Feiyu Guard

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.510
nearly wiped out your kind.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.190
Do you truly want to heal her?

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.190
I did this

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.150
to atone for my sins.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.630
The mountain elf is born of revenge.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.960
What is this atonement for?

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.870
My father once said,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.670
the Yuli Spring is the tears of demons.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.290
What you call immortality

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.590
is just endless suffering.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.060
For revenge,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.790
I swallowed the mud
containing Yuli Spring water

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.570
and became a mountain elf,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.830
killing countless people.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.510
But I suffered the backlash
of my inner demon.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.540
I'm neither dead nor alive;

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.710
neither alive nor destroyed...

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.390
suffering unbearably.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.720
[Temple of Eternal Life]

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.260
We should pay respects at this temple too.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.470
Go get the offerings.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.630
Yes, madam.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.850
Madam, this temple has been abandoned
for over a decade.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.950
The deity's true form
has probably long departed.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.870
Why don't

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.130
we go to the Yanhua Temple ahead instead?

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.340
I made a vow

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.140
to worship at every temple I encounter.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.740
You don't need to come in with me.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.930
Clean up the rest.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.430
Yes.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.960
♪ Cliffside streams flow, pine scents

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.500

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.630

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.860
Though I'm blind,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.090
my heart sees more clearly than yours.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.920
He's very similar to Li:

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.770
cold on the surface,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.640
but his heart cares about you.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.590
He just thinks

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.450
I look like someone from his past.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.220
If he truly cared,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.190
how could he say hurtful things
so casually?

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.190
When he hurts you,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.460
perhaps he feels even worse than you do.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.700
Like when I was little

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.030
and almost hurt myself,

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.660
mother beat me severely
when she found out.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.040
But then she cried even harder than I did.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.020
Are you really not coming back with us?

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.670
My eyes will heal soon.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.270
I can't give up now.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.670
This is the longevity lock

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.590
my parents made for me personally.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.650
There's no other like it in the world.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.910
Give it to my parents,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.820
and they'll believe what you say.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.520
That's not enough?

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.480
Then how about this:

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.640
take Flower Lady back with you

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.160
and let my mother feed her.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.190
Now they should believe you, right?

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.060
Still angry?

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.120
You haven't even apologized.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.950
Why should I speak kindly to you?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.140
I'm sorry.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.420
What did you do wrong?

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.970
My mistake was

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.030
not having the chance

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.950
to tell you what I want to say.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.460
Go ahead.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.750
I know you and Ning'an
are not the same person.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.550
That day in the Misty Forest,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.020
I dispelled Ning'an's illusion
with my own hands.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.180
At that moment, I knew

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.480
the past had become like drifting clouds.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.190
And now before me

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.260
is you,

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.200
Xiao Yao.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.360

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.070
I am not that princess.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:27.950
I know.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.550
I just want to tell you

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.750
I protect you

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.590
not because of anyone else.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:42.950
From now on, don't

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.880
compare me to that princess again.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.680
I don't like hearing it.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.380
All right.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.390
Say it again.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.470
All right.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.250
You said

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.540
Yunyi doesn't want to come back?

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:08.260
Yes.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.430
Her eyes will heal in a few days.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.350
She wants to wait
until her eyes are better

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.080
to come back
and see her parents with her own eyes.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.260
Nonsense!

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.820
My daughter was born blind.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.230
I've searched for the best doctors

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.070
but none could cure her.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.020
You think you can fool us with just a cat?

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.340
Oh, right.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.290
She also gave me this.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.020
She said you would believe me
if I showed you this.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.920
Is my daughter dead?

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.990
Where have you hidden her body?

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.590
Tell me!

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.380
You keep saying your daughter is dead.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.390
Don't you want her to be alive?

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:54.860
You...

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.670
Stop!

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.110
Stop!

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.750
Miss Xiao Yao.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.590
From your description of her behavior,

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.830
it is indeed my daughter Yunyi,
without a doubt.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.630
I believe you.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.350
When her eyes are healed,

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.350
we can go bring her back, can't we?

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.110
He has never liked cats.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.170
It doesn't matter.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:38.940
Let's go.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.610
Now do you believe

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.360
Hong Ye is not the murderer?

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.300
Whether you believe it or not
is not my problem.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.230
Catching the killer
is the Feiyu Guard's job anyway.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.270
But I hope
you won't implicate the innocent

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.110
and can help prevent more
young women in Pingjiang

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.440
from dying needlessly.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.830
The city gates have been closed for days.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.940
Citizens keep
their doors and windows shut.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.630
The Feiyu Guard patrols day and night.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.290
No one else will die unjustly.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.020
If the city gates remain closed,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.670
won't people starve to death?

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.460
True. People fear starvation,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.130
and so does the killer.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.500
You mean...

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.950
As long as he still craves blood,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.590
he'll eventually slip up
and reveal himself.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.320
So what we need to do now is to...

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:38.780
Wait.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.070
Lower your voice.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.300
Don't let everyone in Pingjiang know

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.700
you killed those people.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.980
I'm here.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.500
Thank you for escorting me back.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.260
Xiao Yao.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.210
The city is still not safe.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.740
Stay safe.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.670
Of course.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.220
I hope you can find the killer soon

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.020
and restore Pingjiang's peace.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.870
Of course.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.230
Tan'er.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.690
Hong Ye is clearly in there.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.719
Why won't you come out of your sheath?

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.860
Don't tell me
you've taken a liking to that—

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.150
Just kidding.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.260
Just kidding.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.409
That Feiyu Guard has left?

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.130
Mm-hmm.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.310
He didn't want to chat with you
any longer?

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:46.949
He did.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.030
But there was nothing to talk about.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.260
The wine from the human realm

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.690
is quite interesting.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.290
I am the Demon Lord,

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.270
above all demons.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.750
Similar to your human emperor.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.830
I may seem noble,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.860
but I'm actually lonely.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.530
I have no friends to drink with.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.710
Isn't it just that you don't trust others?

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.640
You make it sound

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.390
so fancy.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.180
I've been sincere before,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.030
and have trusted people too.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.320
But in the end,

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.960
it became a weapon for others to hurt me.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:39.910
Since then,

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.980
I've been unwilling to trust again.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:46.980

become cold-hearted.
