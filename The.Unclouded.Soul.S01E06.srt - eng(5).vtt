[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.600
[Episode 6]

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.680
Mr. Liu,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.070
could you let us
make your two daughters as bait

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.039
to lure out the Demon King

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.200
and rid the people of this menace?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.220
Absolutely not!

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.759
I...

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.920
The Feiyu Guard here,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.050
so don't worry, sir.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.150
We will make sure she's completely safe.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.870
This great demon is way too rampant.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.350
If we don't figure out a way to kill it,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.840
-Xiao Yao, let's go.
-more people will die.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.000
There's still no way!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.680
These are my only 2 precious daughters.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.789
I can't just watch them
go to their deaths!

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.350
How do you know your family won't be next?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.690
My family will definitely not be next.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.560
Tan'er wants to see you.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.470
Tan'er?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.120
Any updates on the great demon?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.920
Hong Ye wasn't the one behind it.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.890
You heard it all?

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.790
How do you know it wasn't him?

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.230
I just know.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400
You saw him today?

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.110
Nope.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400
You did see him.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.890
Tan'er, why didn't you summon me?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.000
Sir,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.710
she's that female swindler from before!

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.360
She stepped on and damaged the tiles
of my office in broad daylight.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.680
This is illegal!

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.190
I came with good intentions to be bait
in place of your daughters

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.720
to lure out the great demon.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.810
Okay, step wherever you like.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.140
Tell our men to fall back a bit.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.470
Yes.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.240
This mist

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.329
doesn't seem quite right.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.520
Xiao Yao!

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.850
Xiao Yao!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.310
Xiao Yao!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.860
Come back quickly!

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.560
You go find boats now to cross

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.600
the river and catch up with me.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.260
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.070
Guys, take our time to look for boats.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.890
No rush.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.030
Hong Ye?

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.190
Xiao Yao?

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.000
Tan'er,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.800
which direction is it exactly?

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.159
Lord Bingzhu!

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.030
Lord Bingzhu, this way!

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.750
Xiao Yao?

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.270
Come on!

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.670
There you are.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.060
I have been waiting for you all this time,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.520
waiting for you to find me.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.830
You've been waiting for me?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.360
Ever since you left Demons' Valley,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.180
I've been waiting for you,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.700
waiting for your return

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.650
to my side.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.600
Why are you suddenly telling me all this?

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.200
I don't know why,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.030
but seeing you

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.530
always makes me feel so happy.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.809
The moment we part,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.179
I just can't wait to see you again.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.130
What about you?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.750
Do you feel the same way?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.010
I don't know why I like you,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.600
but I know

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.320
that with you around,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.680
I can't see anyone else.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.390
Xiao Yao,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.940
from now on,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.720
we'll be together.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.490
I'll stay by your side,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.000
cherish you,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.540
watch the sun rise
and set with you every day,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.670
and even reach for the stars
and the moon for you.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.800
Would you like that?

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.520
I want to be with you forever.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.150
But,

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.020
there's one final condition.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.260
What condition?

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.560
You have to become a complete demon,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.510
feed on human blood

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.740
to increase your power,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.060
and never return to the mortal world.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.530
Xiao Yao!

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
Brother!

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.780
Brother!

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.640
Save me, please!

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.500
Brother! It hurts so much!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.720
Tan'er?

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.170
Did you really

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.600
kill those women?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.830
No, I won't eat humans.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.100
Absolutely not.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.880
If you don't eat them,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.250
you just can't become a pure demon.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.170
You'll also have to die like those women

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.190
at the bottom of the lake.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:30.960
No.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.500
You're not Hong Ye!

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.600
You're not Hong Ye!

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.320
Who are you?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.240
I am Hong Ye.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.630
-Let go of me!
-Don't you recognize me?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.010
You're not Hong Ye!

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.300
Bingzhu!

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.000
Help!

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.320
Bingzhu.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.360
Hurry!

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.140
Save me!

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.030
It really hurts so much.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.600
Bingzhu...

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.120
Help me.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.200
Bingzhu!

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.010
Is that you?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:06.960
Help me!

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.680
Tan'er?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.920
Stop running.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.450
You don't need to exhaust yourself
on the run anymore.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.660
Anyway, you're never needed as a human.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.810
Why not just turn into a demon

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.030
and return all your sufferings

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.930
to those who bullied you?

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.570
Xiao Yao?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.830
Xiao Yao!

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.100
You should call me

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.600
Ning'an.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.930
Why are you afraid to look at me?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.320
Hong Ye,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.470
you once said

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.710
that you would

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.990
die for me.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.270
If you love me,

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.860
then give me your life.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.700
Xiao Yao!

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.030
My Lord!

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.490
My Lord!

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.480
My Lord!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.320
Are you real or an illusion?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.170
My Lord! My Lord!

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.840
It's me,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.430
Ji Yan.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.550
If you're real,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.090
then retreat.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.780
Go back the way you came.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.240
Pardon?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.790
Retreat!

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.960
Yes.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.200
Xiao Yao!

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.150
It's me.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.230
Don't touch me!

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.500
Don't touch me!

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.510
Go away!

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.640
I'm the real Hong Ye.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.080
-You summoned me with the jade pendant,
-Let go of me!

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.210
so I came to find you.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.190
It's really me.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.520
No matter what happened to you just now,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.060
it was just a dream.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.890
It's over now.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.840
You're Hong Ye for real?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.390
You are

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.200
the real Hong Ye?

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.390
No.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.360
I'm the old demon.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.360
There, there.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.030
Don't be afraid.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.640
I thought I was going to...

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.980
It's okay.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
It's all over now.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.430
This outfit was a gift from you.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.260
I can give you another one.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.910
I have plenty of money anyway.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.530
Money, money, money.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.160
All you think about is money.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.440
Money can't get you everything.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.210
At least it can get me clothes.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:12.720
Fine.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.210
Buy whatever you want since you're rich.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.109
You might as well
buy me several more outfits

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.109
for you mess up with your tears, huh?

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.400
This time, I really needed help
to save my life.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.220
I didn't summon you for no reason.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.520
I wasn't blaming you before.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.580
Where are we?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.400
It looks like an ordinary forest,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.110
but somehow everything feels so weird.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.740
This is the Misty Forest.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.400
What you saw earlier were

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.330
all illusions created by the mist.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.070
It can reflect the deepest desires

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.070
buried inside you

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.540
and manipulate your body and mind.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.260
Xiao Yao,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.930
from now on,

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.170
we'll be together.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.640
I'll stay by your side,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.760
cherish you,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200
watch the sun rise
and set with you every day,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.700
and even reach for the stars
and the moon for you.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.830
Would you like that?

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.940
What did you

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.160
see just now?

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.110
Nothing.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.240
I saw nothing.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.170
What about you? Did you see anything?

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.350
I...

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.840
I saw nothing but you
as soon as I entered here.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.900
Well, then,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.270
perhaps we should...

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.000
We should get out of here first.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.830
Mm.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.050
Stay behind me.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.440
Did you see anyone else

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.790
besides me in this forest just now?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.960
-No.
-Nope.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.920
My Lord,

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.590
did we lose

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920
that girl?

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.700
She must still be in this forest.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.150
But this mist is so spooky

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.250
that it can manipulate one's mind.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.810
We can't let our men take this risk again.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:36.920
Yes.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.370
Little kitty, why are you here alone?

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.100
Are you lost?

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.720
Flower Lady!

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.300
Flower Lady,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.940
where did you go again?

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.440
I hear you.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.610
Come on over.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.890
Flower Lady!

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.400
Flower Lady.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.350
You naughty thing,
I told you not to run around.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.200
Stop meowing.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:48.800
Li?

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.240
Why are you here?

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:51.990
I've found Flower Lady.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.360
[Li]

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.260
Let's go back.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.590
Let's go.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.080
We made it out.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.460
Let me take a rest.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.750
We're finally out of there.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.750
What a creepy place.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.770
That girl just now

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.530
seems to be the Qionghua Sect's heiress.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.270
It's all your fault.
I didn't even get to ask her properly

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.800
before you dragged me away.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.920
This forest is so eerie that you are

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.350
lucky enough to have made it out.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.310
Yet you're blaming me?

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.450
You're a man.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.030
In the human world,
even if women speak recklessly,

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.430
men shouldn't talk back.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.200
Fine. I won't argue with you.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.580
That masked one,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.180
is he a human or a demon?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.180
Why did you look

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.180
so alarmed?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.730
I'm not quite sure either.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.750
I could only sense

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.820
a very different aura around him.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.440
He's not like a demon,

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.490
and even less like a human.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.640
Neither human nor demon?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.580
Isn't he basically the same as me?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.240
By the way,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.300
where are Luoluo and Dali?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.230
In Pingjiang,

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.720
at the magistrate's office.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.920
They've been caught?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.320
Did you come here

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:23.720
because of them?

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.030
No.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.530
Actually...

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.810
My feet fell asleep.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.500
Six girls died in Pingjiang.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.440
And the Qionghua Sect's heiress
has gone missing.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.240
They all say you're the culprit.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.550
I just want to prove to them

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.530
that you're not.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.530
Come on,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.330
go back to Demons' Valley with me for now.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.370
Hold on.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.010
What about the blade?
We haven't got it yet.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.680
I had Xiao Mu mention stealing the blade

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.400
just in order to give you
a chance to leave.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.930
Demons' Valley is safe now.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.740
You can do anything as you wish.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.090
What about Luoluo and Dali?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.130
Don't worry.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.260
After ensuring your safety,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.390
I'll go pick them up.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.390
Also...

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.830
What about the charges I brought upon you?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.490
Demons' Valley has its rules.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.370
We can't risk our people's lives

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.400
just because of Hei Wu's assertion.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.000
My body has fully recovered,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.410
with my power greatly boosted.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.440
If they dare disturb the order again,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520
I will definitely banish them
from Demons' Valley.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.120
By the way,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.960
Bamboo is still young.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.640
Don't take his behaviors personally.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.500
When I return,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.530
I'll make sure he treats you well.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.410
Does this jade pendant

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.140
stop working in water?

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.320
No.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.960
Then why didn't you come
when I almost drowned

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.890
last time?

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:09.500
You came?

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.270
You did come!

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.100
So you were the one who saved me
last time, right?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.400
Mm.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.770
That blade also attracted
the Feiyu Guards.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.660
I didn't want to fight them
in the human realm.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.590
Seeing you safe,

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680
I just left first.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.510
What about that time at the inn?

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.830
I summoned you in water at the inn, too.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:34.720
Mm.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.070
So that means you...

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.750
I didn't.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.680
I saw nothing.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.400
I just hid behind the screen.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.880
I haven't even said what it was,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.550
but you already know
what I'm talking about.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.380
That means you did see me!

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.240
-I...
-You saw me!

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.550
Xiao Yao,

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.740
i-it was you who summoned me.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.510
But...

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.280
But you did see me, didn't you?

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.160
Xiao Yao, I really didn't see anything.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.890
I only saw you in the wooden tub.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.370
No, I mean...

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.160
I-I didn't see the wooden tub.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.480
I did see the wooden tub.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400
I just... I just didn't see you.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.310
Then I totally freaked out

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.870
and hid inside the wooden tub...

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.470
I just hid behind the screen.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.680
I really didn't see you.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.540
I could only...

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.200
Not mad anymore?

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.630
Mm, not mad anymore.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.080
Not anymore.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.270
Stop!

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.200
Who allowed you to shoot?

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.060
There's still a human on the boat!

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.130
Xiao Yao!

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.660
You've already lured out Hong Ye,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.480
proving that you're a human, not a demon.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.680
Jump off the boat now!

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.960
My Lord,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.030
give the order to shoot.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.200
Forget about Xiao Yao now.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.000
Lord Bingzhu,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.920
Hong Ye is not the culprit.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.960
It's someone else!

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.590
The Qionghua Sect Leader's daughter is
still alive.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.750
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.960
Who else could pull that off
other than him?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.480
Demons are always despicable.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.920
Don't be threatened or bewitched by him!

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.680
Bewitched?

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.020
You say I'm the culprit.
Where's your evidence?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.840
Shoot!

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.690
Another round!

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.380
Lord Bingzhu, you can't kill the innocent.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.440
Hong Ye, tell him

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.750
that you didn't harm those girls.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.590
Say it now!

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.840
I don't need to explain myself
to the Feiyu Guard.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.650
I'll take that as a confession.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.790
Let go of Xiao Yao

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.350
and fight me.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.070
Okay.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.210
Lord Bingzhu,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.350
you keep saying he's the culprit.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.750
Do you have any evidence?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.410
What more evidence do we need?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.880
The massacre in the imperial palace
a century ago

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.540
and Princess Ning'an's death

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.440
both involved him!

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.120
My past is

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.410
none of your business.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.910
If you dare say one more word,

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.350
I'll make sure
you die the most terrible death!

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440
Die!

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.110
Tan'er.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:32.320
Tan'er!

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.850
Lord Bingzhu,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.910
no matter how deep the enmity
between humans and demons runs,

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.360
if Hong Ye is not the culprit,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.170
he should not bear this unjust blame.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.720
I hope you can judge fairly

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.690
and hurry to find the real culprit.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.130
The real culprit?

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.000
Very well.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.790
When I get to the bottom of it,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.100
I'll make sure you die fair and square.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.000
My Lord, you used retreat to advance.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.210
What a wise move.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.080
Retreat.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.760
Are you alright?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.130
My Lord.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.210
See if you want the memorial
to go like this.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.400
"The Feiyu Guards surrounded

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.680
the great demon, Hong Ye, at the lake

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.140
and fought him for 4 hours.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.100
Hong Ye was severely wounded.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.640
Though he made a narrow escape,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.510
he was already at death's door,

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.040
unable to harm anyone else.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.370
The Feiyu Guards

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.440
have mobilized Zhou City's officials
to pursue with full force

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.450
and will eliminate the demon soon."

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.520
Do you want to bring
even more shame on us?

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.480
Commander Ji,

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.310
please tell our men to keep

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.210
what happened at the lake today

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.550
a secret.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.060
Understood.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.340
Give His Lordship some space.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.240
Take a break, guys.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.330
Tan'er,

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.880
what's wrong with you today?

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.470
Do you also believe

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.770
that Hong Ye is not truly an evil demon?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.240
Princess Ning'an died because of you.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.710
Is that true?

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.810
Xiao Yao,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:46.600
don't ask.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.070
I must look like her so much

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.460
so that you mistook me for her when you

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.810
saw me for the first time.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.440
If I looked nothing like her,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.710
would you still protect me like this?

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.310
You're not saying anything.

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.180
At first, I did mistake you for her,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.530
but later I realized
you're not the same person.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.140
Now,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.440
no matter who you are,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.080
I will...

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.910
There's no "before"
or "after" about my identity.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.570
My name is Xiao Yao.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.200
I've been called Xiao Yao my entire life,

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.350
not some "Ning'an."

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.550
I know you're only nice to me

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.700
because I look like Princess Ning'an.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.690
I've accepted it to stay alive.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.130
That's it.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.880
I'm just curious

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.240
about what exactly happened
between you two.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.150
Just asking.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.130
Looks like

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.940
this is really not something
I can ask about.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.970
Forget I said anything.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.780
Just some bygones. There's

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.500
no need to bring them up again.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.960
I suppose this jade pendant wasn't

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.510
meant to protect me, either.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.160
In all my travels,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.020
I never did anything I regretted.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.100
But now, my greatest regret is

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.760
that I accidentally woke you up.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.960

Bad demon, shady demon.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.590
Selfish!

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.770
Left without hesitation.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.240
These are chaotic times indeed.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.770
Demons have even infiltrated
the magistrate's office.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.500
Exactly.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.880
No wonder they've failed to catch any!

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.310
Yeah.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.680
Aren't they deceiving and betraying us?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.590
Let's go to the magistrate's office.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.920
Let's go!

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.380
-Go take a look.
-Let's go.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.780
Dali, Luoluo...

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.510
We've searched the entire city
with talismans only to find nothing.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.510
So the demons were

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.480
hiding in the magistrate's office!

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.710
Can't believe

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.880
the dignified government office
harbored demons!

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.800
Were it not
for the Qionghua Sect's intelligence,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.320
how long would you plan
to keep them hidden?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.239
The Feiyu Guards ordered us to hide them.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.670
It has nothing to do with our office!

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.320
Are you saying

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.409
that the Feiyu Guards,

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.230
whose job is to catch demons,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.920
actually

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.770
keep minor demons?

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.920
I didn't say anything just now.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.280
Kill him!

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.510
Kill him!

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.190
Slay the demons!

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.840
Kill him!

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.710
The Feiyu Guards have kept
these 2 minor demons

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.370
to help investigate the case.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.300
Master Jin, why make such a fuss?

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.320
Are there any discoveries?

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.980
Another day has passed,

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.710
and I still don't know
whether my daughter is alive or not.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.030
Since you, Feiyu Guards, are
so out of your mind,

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.160
our Qionghua Sect will uphold justice

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.180
and execute them

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.860
right here and now!

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.520
Luoluo! Luoluo!

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.800
Luoluo.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.710
Stop it!

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.420
I've found your daughter.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.480
She's still alive.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.060
Where is Yunyi?

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.440
Release my 2 friends,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.040
and I'll take you to find her.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.820
Your friends?

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.280
Though they are demons,

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.740
they have never done any evil things.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.960
The one who took your daughter isn't

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.150
Demon King Hong Ye.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.160
I saw it myself.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.470
-My daughter... Where on earth is she?
-Nonsense!

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.190
This woman clearly has a demonic aura,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.120
and she's even protecting demons.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:51.990
Master Jin, please calm down

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.670
and don't hurt the innocent.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.840
Qionghua disciples!

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.890
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.190
Does your daughter have a cat

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.250
named Flower Lady?

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.230
Only I know

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.360
where your daughter is.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.480
If you kill us,

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.010
you'll never see her again.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.530
Honey.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.630
You've already exhausted yourself

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.590
worrying about our daughter.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.920
Don't force your core energy,
or it'll hurt your meridians.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.590
She's my only daughter.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.860
If anything happens to her,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.190
there would be no point in me living.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.710
Put away your swords!

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.590
As long as Yunyi can return
safe and sound,

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.120
I'll release your friends.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.240
Good. It's a deal.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.460
I'll give you 3 days. Three days at most.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.700
Deliver meals twice a day.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.030
Don't let any unauthorized persons

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.890
approach here.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:36:59.420
Yes.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.550
Luoluo has a big appetite.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.360
Dali needs plenty of water

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.170
and sunlight.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.710
Change the meals to 3 deliveries a day.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.030
Prepare a large water tank in the room

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.510
and allow them out for half an hour daily.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.960
Yes.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.190
Follow me.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:12.820
Move aside!

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.960
Xiao Yao,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.670
be honest with me.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.710
Do you really have

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.040
the confidence to bring her back
in 3 days?

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400
I think I can do it.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.590
Do you know that your escape
from that forest today was

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.650
pure luck?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.400
[Pingjiang Prefecture] [Misty Forest]

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:40.800
Here is

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.590
the Misty Forest.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.880
It's not large, only about 666 hectares.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.840
But it's shrouded in mist all year round

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840
with no sunlight.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.210
Locals don't dare to enter it

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.630
because once they go in,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.160
almost none can make it out.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.110
Occasionally, some do escape,

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.710
but they never remember
what happened inside.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.940
It's not as terrifying as you say.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.840
If I could escape once,

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.070
I can make it again.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.880
By the way,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.160
today you said

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.600
you saw the person who kidnapped the girl?

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.070
Yes.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.660
What does he look like?

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.310
He has an iron hand

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.910
and also a mask on his face.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.450
But strangely enough,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.730
he seemed to mean no harm to the girl.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.810
Instead, they appeared quite close.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.910
Has this forest always been so peculiar?

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.660
Not really.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.820
Twenty years ago,

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.800
a tribe called Hefeng
from the Northern Prairie

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.560
grew increasingly powerful

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.510
and had frequent conflicts
along our Tiancheng Kingdom's borders.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.620
So they sent an assassination team

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.030
into our territory,

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.440
intending to assassinate His Majesty.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.710
They were discovered by us

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.240
and pursued relentlessly.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.080
Ultimately, they ended up being

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.520
eliminated in this forest,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.030
with their bodies cremated.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.010
Perhaps those assassins' resentment was
so strong

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.440
that it gathered
to form this mysterious mist

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.770
that never dissipates.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.200
So this place became a forbidden area.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.630
Is what you're saying recorded in books

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.230
or...

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.110
It's recorded in the confidential scrolls
of the Feiyu Guards.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.310
Fine, fine. The Feiyu Guards' records.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.900
But when I entered this forest today,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.110
it felt

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.900
like someone had set up a barrier.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.360
This barrier is similar to...

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.990
It's like the one in Demons' Valley.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.670
Where there's a barrier,
there must be a passage.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.130
That makes things easier.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.910
[The news of the demon devouring humans
has spread throughout Pingjiang.]

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:44.760
[Suddenly,]

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.000
[all the girls started
fleeing from the city.]

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.600
[The families
who didn't have time to escape]

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.030
[just had their daughters either hidden]

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.650
[or disguised as boys]

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.770
[to avoid being found by the demon.]

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.440
Dad!

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.650
Mom!

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:56.230
My dear.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.460
I don't care!

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.990
Just listen to my advice.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.360
Staying home every day is
driving me crazy!

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.480
-Yeah! I want to hang out!
-So boring!

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.080
It's still better to be bored

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.640
than get eaten by a demon.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.510
You know what?

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.760
That demon

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.200
only goes after
beautiful young ladies like you.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.220
If you die,

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.410
handsome Lord Bingzhu

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.340
will belong to someone else.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.920
Anyway,

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.550
crying and making a fuss won't help.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.510
Honey,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.000
nail these doors

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.490
shut completely.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.110
From today on,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.020
before the culprit is caught,

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.320
no one is allowed
to step outside this room.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.010
My Lord, you seem a bit out of sorts.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.360
Did you

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.160
have a fight with Xiao Yao again?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:50.890
"Again"?

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.940
I mean,

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.320
having a fight isn't a big deal.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.290
The main issue now is
that Luoluo and Dali

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.000
have ended up in human hands.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.030
What should we do?

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.990
Their lives are not in danger for now.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.510
And Xiao Yao

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.560
will work it out on her own.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.920
With her half-baked demonic power,

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.610
she'll probably just get herself killed.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.550
Miss, do you want to buy hemp ropes?

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.550
Are these all the hemp ropes you have?
Do you have any more?

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.230
Yes, we have more! How many do you need?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.620
I'll take all you have.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.030
Please follow me to the back warehouse.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.890
We have plenty.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:29.710
Wait.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.090
What do you need so many ropes for?

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.840
There's only one way
to enter the Misty Forest.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.770
Wait for me here.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.590
No,

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.100
I must go to Pingjiang City myself.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.430
No, you can't.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.240
My Lord, you can go if you want to.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.780
I'll wait for your return.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.510
No...

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.440
See? I was right on the money.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:54.960
I'll take them all.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.710
Please deliver them
to the magistrate's office.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.440
No problem.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.070
Who are you?
