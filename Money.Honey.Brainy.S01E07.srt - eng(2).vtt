00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.880
What?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.079
Family dinner.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.359
I'm not going.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.399
Kexin.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.479
How's your father been lately?

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.240
My dad?

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.320
Same as always.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.759
I remember...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.320
The last time I saw you...

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.039
You were still in middle school, right?

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.280
She's blossomed beautifully.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.439
I heard from our Pei An...

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.399
that you two get along very well.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.960
Has this kid...

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.479
been bullying you?

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.640
No.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:03.840
The two of us...

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.879
have mutual respect.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.680
To be honest with you...

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.280
Since he was born...

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.359
I haven't really looked after him much.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.200
Nor have I looked after this family much.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.079
Darling.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.719
This glass of milk...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.799
you can't drink.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.359
This milk contains...

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.519
wheat bran.

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.120
Aren't you gluten allergic?

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:50.640
Give this one to me.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.400
You drink this one.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.519
Our Pei An's birthday is next week.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.519
Do you two...

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.760
have any plans?

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.799
Uncle...

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400
I think you might be mistaken.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.920
Pei An's birthday isn't for...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.280
another two months.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.760
I've already secretly...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.319
started preparing for him.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.000
I originally intended...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.680
to give you a little surprise.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.199
You two...

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.919
graduated from the same school, right?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.479
Yes.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.199
But...

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.360
during my studies...

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.479
I went to Italy for a two-year study tour.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.280
After all...

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.240
my family is in the clothing business.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.120
So...

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.840
I went there...

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.280
to study fashion design.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.560
Fashion design?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.439
Italy.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.120
Which fashion designer do you like most?

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.360
Rei Kawakubo.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.800
I like the revolutionary...

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.360
new dressing philosophy she advocates.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.919
Good, good.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.240
Pei An.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.280
You two...

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.960
get along well.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.599
So?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.479
My performance today...

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.560
does it deserve a raise?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.840
When did you learn Italian?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.240
I used to...

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.080
love watching Italian movies.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.000
Like Federico Fellini...

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.240
and Antonioni.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.680
I watched every single one...

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.319
of those authentic old films.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.199
Without realizing it...

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.360
I learned authentic Italian.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.599
What a coincidence...

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
that it came in handy today.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.719
Today's date...

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.000
can count as triple pay.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.759
Not triple.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.039
I want you to do me a small favor.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.520
Go ahead.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.719
I'll help you.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.520
I want...

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.800
to borrow your body.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.000
What do you mean?

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.560
Will you marry me?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.079
You're not even trying.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.639
Marry me.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.399
You clearly look disgusted.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.040
Who proposes by shoving the ring in someone's face?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.639
Just try a different way.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.879
Will you marry me?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.319
That's a bit interesting.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.519
Remember this feeling.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.560
Hold it.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.639
This is my first big-name ad campaign.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.480
Originally...

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.560
I wanted to spend a fortune...

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.160
to hire a model to shoot it.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.720
But then I thought...

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.720
this...

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.279
with such a handsome guy right in front of me...

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.920
why would I look for a model?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560
How silly of me.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.639
I can't do it.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.879
I can't show my face.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.639
I didn't say show your face.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.120
You owe me this.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.360
Fine.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.759
One hour max.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.399
Two hours.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.920
It's settled then.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.000
I'll go freshen up.

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.800
How much longer?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.920
I'm in a hurry.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.319
Coming, coming!

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.240
What are you looking at?

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:01.959
Just sit here.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.560
Right on this chair.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Aren't you in a hurry?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.000
Wait.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.920
Let me get some handsome lighting on you.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.279
One, two, three.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.959
Good.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.600
This is interesting.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.000
Okay.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.680
Here.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.160
First, put this ring on.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.079
Like this first.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.160
This spot is good.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.720
Yes.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.800
Just...

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.600
That's the idea.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.040
Come on.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.519
Ready.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.319
Three.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.480
Two.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.120
One.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.639
Another one.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:50.439
You...

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.199
like this.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.920
Yes.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.639
Yes.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:54.680
Hold here.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.240
Then I'll hold here.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.399
This looks good.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.000
Here, here.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:01.720
Take a look.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.959
Beautiful.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.720
Let's take another one standing up.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.439
Stand up.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.319
Put your hand on my shoulder.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:27.480
Like this?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.839
Okay.

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.959
Hold still.

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:31.839
Let me check the framing.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.800
Good, good, good.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.879
So handsome.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.480
Look at me.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.839
Look into my eyes.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:56.800
Imagine...

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.040
that the person in front of you...

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.720
is your company's financial statements.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:02.759
Profit or loss?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.959
Profit.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.040
Now try imagining a loss.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.199
I mean...

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360
a loss so severe...

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.120
it's beyond recovery.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.759
Why do both expressions look the same?

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:32.159
Profit and loss, to you...

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:32.720
both...

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.960
cause no emotional ripple.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.440
Then look at me.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.120
What would you imagine me to be...

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.559
to make your eyes...

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.519
fill with...

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:42.279
love?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.159
Interesting.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:01.639
Let me see.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:03.879
Not bad at all.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.200
Take off your jacket...

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.879
and lend it to me.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.120
Then what do I wear?

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.120
You're covered up so much.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.200
What's the point of asking you to take it off?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.000
With a body like that...

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.639
you should show it off.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.759
So sexy.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:31.399
A hint of skin.

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:31.879
Just like that.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.559
First shot.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.159
Three.

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:37.399
Two.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:38.159
One.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:05.600
Okay.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:06.559
Ready.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:07.279
Three.

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:08.399
Two.

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.519
One.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.080
Turn your head toward me.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.840
Yes.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.519
And...

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.759
You can also do this.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.240
Your hand...

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:26.320
grab my hand.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:29.399
Show it.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.279
No.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.559
This is the feeling.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.600
Let's go.

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.080
Three.

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:42.799
Two.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.399
One.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.759
That's it.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.039
Let me see.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.360
You...

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.440
are really good at this.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.600
A natural talent.

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:56.440
You've even learned to pose on your own.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.200
Alright.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.440
Thank you for today.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.679
You should see a Chinese medicine doctor.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.679
Why?

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:06.120
Your hands are a bit cold.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.200
Anyway, thanks for your great help today.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.399
Let me buy you a drink.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.960
No, thanks.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.200
I'm a bit tired today.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.440
I'm going up to rest.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:19.879
Don't go.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.639
You just don't get it.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.080
Drinking...

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.399
is the best kind of rest.
