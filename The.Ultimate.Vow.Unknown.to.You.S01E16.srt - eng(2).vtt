00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.900
Yuwen Que led his troops
to massacre my entire family.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.459
What's there to explain?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.360
It's not like that.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.679
Your mother was called
a boat courtesan,

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.520
but she was actually the Emperor
of Cangzhou's favored concubine.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.579
The prince Yuwen Que

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.220
was not your mother's true enemy.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.363
Impossible.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.349
But I clearly saw him.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.961
Back then, your mother was set up.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:25.912
That's why...

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:27.907
Could it be that all these years

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.900
I've hated the wrong person?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.659
Young Lady Shen,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.340
what you saw was not the truth.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.500
The one who truly harmed
your mother is someone else.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.882
So it really wasn't him?

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.019
Then tell me,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.379
who was the real culprit?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.939
This...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.418
Say it.

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:46.220
Young lady, the buns are ready.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:51.579
The buns are here.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:04.899
Young lady,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.060
it's getting late.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.258
Let's go back.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.299
You go ahead.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.459
I'll take a look around.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.300
Young lady,

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.379
I want to tell you something.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.300
What is it?

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.500
Since you've already heard it,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.740
I want to tell you the truth
about your origin.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.160
(Your father is the Emperor of Cangzhou)
Young lady, this letter

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400
was given to me by your mother
before she died to pass on to you.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.589
So it turns out

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.979
I am just an abandoned child
of the Emperor of Cangzhou.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.778
No wonder my mother said before she died

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.060
not to hate.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.939
Young lady,

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.058
your mother was
also powerless back then.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.500
Powerless?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.338
Then why did he abandon me and my mother

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:49.845
in Cangzhou?

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.419
Why?

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.979
Why did he let Yuwen Que's
family try to exterminate us?

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.145
Do you know

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.780
why she told you not to hate?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.699
Because she knew

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.459
your father was also powerless.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.180
Is it just because he's high and mighty?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.857
Because he's the Emperor?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.020
Do you remember those people
who protected you on the road?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.979
Those people were probably secret guards
sent by His Majesty.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.180
Even so,

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.979
then why does he never appear?

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.819
Maybe

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.459
he's afraid you would hate him.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.979
I think even as an Emperor,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.060
he has attachments he cannot let go of.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.220
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:42.245
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.979
(Mother.)

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.699
(Should I)

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.539
(take this step?)

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:11.618
(Emperor of Cangzhou)

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:12.740
Qingru.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.780
Hearing Your Majesty

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.139
call me this is really intimate.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.459
Over the years...

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.657
Your Majesty, show restraint.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.859
You're not worthy to be my father.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.299
Qingru.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.380
Back then,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.619
I had no choice.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.940
Had no choice?

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.099
Then when my mother
was being chased and killed,

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.539
where were you?

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.739
When we were hiding,

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:48.020
where were you then?

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.361
Qingru,

00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:55.899
hold on a little longer.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.699
Mother,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.419
I want my father.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.218
Be good.

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.499
Hold on.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.845
(Apothecary)

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:03.757
Yes.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.032
You are the Emperor of Cangzhou.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.858
How could you ruin your reputation

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:11.220
for a boat courtesan

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:12.978
and her daughter?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.539
That's not how it was.

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:17.059
I sent people to search for you.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.099
Then why didn't you
go find her yourself?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.220
Why did you let her
bear everything alone?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.380
Do you know?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.659
When I was little,

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.659
every time I saw other children
cherished by their fathers,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.419
I would wonder

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.499
why didn't my father want me?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.900
Qingru.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:37.738
Qingru.

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:39.179
Before my mother died,

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.870
she was still making excuses for you,

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:44.520
saying you truly loved her.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.095
But your love

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.380
was watching her die with your own eyes.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.979
As your father,

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.539
I am sorry to you both.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.332
One "sorry"

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.020
and you think it erases 18 years?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.179
Qingru.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.020
Let me make it up to you.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.380
From this day on,

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.819
you will be the Princess of Cangzhou.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.900
I don't need it.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.619
Qingru.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.780
You may hate me,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.298
but please give me one chance.

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:17.619
Do you know?

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:18.739
I keep thinking

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.340
if back then,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.020
you had stood up to protect us,

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.260
maybe my mother wouldn't have died.

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:30.700
Maybe

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.359
I wouldn't have taken this path either.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.245
(Mother.)

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.099
(Isn't it ridiculous?)

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.499
(The one
who should have protected us most)

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.260
(became the most cowardly of all.)

00:07:01.662 --> 00:07:05.020
(Cangzhou)

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:12.140
Young lady.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:23.460
Di.

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.470
Tell me,

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.778
who are you really?

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.739
Why do you know so much?

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.380
Young lady.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.738
All these years, I have been acting
under the Emperor's orders

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:37.357
to protect you and your mother.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.259
So these ten-plus years of affection

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.940
were merely duty?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.140
No.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.299
I never...

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.499
Cui Di.

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.460
Whatever bond we had

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.940
ends here.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.979
Young lady, listen to me.

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:57.140
From this moment on,

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:58.940
we are no longer friends.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.700
I truly cared for you.

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:22.218
Your Highness.

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:23.379
Let us charge in together

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.419
and rescue Her Ladyship.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.340
No.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.859
We won the first battle

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.179
during the war with Cangzhou.

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:30.700
We must remain vigilant.

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:32.580
I'll go alone.

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:37.620
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:42.019
Your Majesty, urgent report!

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.220
Speak.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.940
In the battle of Mobei,
our army suffered a crushing defeat.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.330
The Eighth Prince

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.739
fell on the battlefield.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.607
What?

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.739
This...

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.339
The Crown Prince of Mobei,
Yuwen Que has arrived outside the city.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.779
He requests peace talks.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.859
My son...

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:12.178
Did he come alone?

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:13.139
Yes.

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:14.540
Open the city gates.

00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:16.259
Your Majesty.

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.779
Go summon the princess.

00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:24.899
Who is there?

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.259
Ru, I've come to take you away.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.219
Yuwen Que.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.019
You're not capable of that.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.420
You used me.

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:58.859
The arrow is poisoned.

00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:01.099
What a perfect trap.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.220
Today will be your death.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.178
It's too dangerous.

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:05.220
Go, now!

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.940
Loose the arrows!

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:19.499
Don't move!

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:24.660
Ru.

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:26.379
Why did you save me?

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.259
If I let you die so easily,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.739
wouldn't that be letting you off?

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:33.460
I haven't taken my revenge yet.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.660
Ru!

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:36.979
You even kill using
such despicable means.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.139
Emperor of Cangzhou.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:43.499
I will repay tenfold

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.379
for today's hatred.

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:51.486
♪Counting in solitude alone♪

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:54.178
♪Counting the cold in your eyes♪

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:55.820
What have I done?

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:58.859
What have I done?

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.739
Chase them! Don't let them escape!

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.499
Yes!
