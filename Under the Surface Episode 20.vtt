Ms. Ye.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.840
Where were you on August 27th

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320
between 6 and 9 PM?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.080
Do you mean

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.840
last Friday evening?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.960
Yes.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.530
I was having dinner with Xiangyang

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.200
and some of his friends

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.720
at Yufeng Restaurant.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.180
Do you have witnesses?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.240
Yes.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.540
Xiangyang,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.920
Mr. and Mrs. Sun,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Mr. and Mrs. Wang -

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.640
they can all testify for me.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.760
Go verify the time.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.720
Okay.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.160
Then where were you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.040
on June 1st at 6 PM?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.000
That was too long ago.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.450
I can't quite remember.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.370
Take a careful look.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000
Is this masked woman in the footage you?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.160
That's not me.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.940
You're so certain?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.450
Because that day

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.120
I was learning to cook at Xiangyang's sister's home.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.480
Xiangyang called me

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240
saying Rachel was hospitalized,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360
so we rushed straight to the hospital.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.720
So Xiangyang and his sister,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.480
as well as the doctor on duty,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800
can all vouch for me.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.120
Then why did you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.250
check the surveillance footage at Yunduan Restaurant?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.400
Rachel

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.720
was my former agent.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.400
She had an allergic reaction to medication due to drinking

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.460
and collapsed in front of Xiangyang.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.560
Before she died, she said

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.880
she went to Yunduan Restaurant,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.720
met a friend,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.250
and had some drinks.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.090
So Xiangyang wanted to know

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.050
exactly how much she drank,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.820
so he checked the surveillance footage.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.860
And the result?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.450
So this woman is...?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.130
I don't know her.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.880
But you're the police.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680
Shouldn't you be the ones investigating this?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.979
Shelly was your college roommate

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.040
and has come looking for you several times.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.440
What's going on with her?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.340
She's a drug addict

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.130
so she's been borrowing money from everyone.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.560
And not just from me,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
she also asked Xiangyang for money.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.000
By the way,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.160
Shi Xiaodi said

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400
she went missing last month.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.920
As for whether she borrowed money from Xiaodi,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm not sure,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.560
but it's highly likely.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.970
Go verify what she said.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.960
I've confirmed it.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.960
She definitely wasn't at the scene.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.000
Don't worry.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.100
I'm in good health.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.000
I'll be fine for sure.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.840
Since we're at the hospital,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.690
you should get checked too.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.140
That would put my mind at ease.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.720
Okay,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.800
I'll do whatever you say.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:14.839
Actually,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.040
you shouldn't have

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.920
done that yesterday.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.240
Done what?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.540
You clearly can't swim at all,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.480
yet you gave me the life ring.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.460
Why did you do that?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.290
Actually...

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.800
I had a dream last night.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.420
I dreamed about Hong Ming.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.560
Hong Ming?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.050
Hong Ming died by accident.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.600
In my dream,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.480
everything was so vivid.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.040
So,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.210
what exactly

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.080
happened that day?
