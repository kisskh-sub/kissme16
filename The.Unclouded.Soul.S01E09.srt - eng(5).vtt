[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.789
[Episode 9]

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.400
I'm dying of laughter!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.310
Is it funny?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.920
Yes.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.350
Change your form.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.240
You can do it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.790
Looks just like him!

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.680
Amazing!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.400
I once experienced life
in the human realm,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.470
and I witnessed joy and sorrow,
partings and reunions,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.240
and the depth of parental love.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.560
To say humans have no true love

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.180
is plainly biased.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.560
Xiao Mu is naturally eccentric.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.520
I usually

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.470
take the blame for him.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.250
What he said just now was ill-chosen.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.810
Everyone, just listen and let it pass.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.840
Please don't take it to heart.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.680
Meow.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.840
-That's just like him!
-That's just like him!

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.370
Go to the cliff now
and reflect on your faults.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.210
Anyone who pleads for her

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.110
will be punished as well.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.530
Admit your mistake,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.090
and I will let you go.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.430
Fine.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.079
Apologize to me,

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.880
and I'll let bygones be bygones.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.930
What did you say?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.800
You told us to change our forms,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.400
and I did it better than anyone.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.730
Why am I being punished?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.560
You openly spoke for humans

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.310
and broke the demon rules.
You deserve severe punishment.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.800
Letting you reflect here

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.000
is already leniency.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280
And you still dare to push your luck?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.210
Everything I said is true.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.400
You may have your stance,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.910
but you shouldn't have ignored the facts

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.570
and smeared humans like that.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.520
You were misleading the minor demons.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.150
If this continues,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.870
they will only hate humans more,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.560
and the conflict
between the two races will never end.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.360
Whether you're human or a demon,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.840
the demon realm cannot tolerate
divided loyalties.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.000
Since you are in the Demons' Valley,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.730
you can only stand with demons.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.120
Even His Lordship no longer demands

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.080
that I choose one side or the other.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.810
Why are you pressing me so hard?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.520
Ever since I entered the Demons' Valley,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.030
you've been targeting me at every turn.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.960
I have swallowed my pride
and tried to appease you,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.290
yet you only escalated.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm going to speak with His Lordship
about this.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.660
you stubborn old fool.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.390
You've been poisoning His Lordship
with your heretical ideas.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.329
Today I'll teach you a lesson.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560
You're actually used...

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.070
Yes.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.250
It's the Demon-binding Rope.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.650
Remember this, Xiao Yao.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.190
As long as I'm here,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.430
I will never allow you
to disrupt Demon Hearts.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.630
When you sincerely admit your mistake,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.720
the Demon-binding Rope
will release itself.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.120
I've done nothing wrong!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.190
I've done nothing wrong!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.360
If Xiao Dadan knows

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.870
I'm being bullied like this by a cat…

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.100
Are you cold?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.430
Are you hungry?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.020
Who are you?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.840
Are you Xiao Ming or Xiao Mu?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.800
Xiao Mu punished you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.560
only to teach you a lesson.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.890
How about this?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.360
Starting today,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.720
you'll water the camellias

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.920
on the back hill for 3 days straight,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.520
and we'll let this matter go.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.159
It's getting late.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.310
Go back and get some rest.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.770
Since when do you care so much
about flowers?

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.120
Every flower and blade of grass has life.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.659
Of course I care.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.950
Don't you only care about His Lordship?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.350
Yes.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.070
But

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.270
His Lordship protects all living things.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.240
What I am doing
is helping ease his burden.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.830
Don't overthink it.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.430
Let's go.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.950
You're so beautiful.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
Right?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.450
I knew that today, I...

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920
I've been exposed.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.520
By whom?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.360
How could she tell
when you're so convincing?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.680
I know.
I thought I looked very convincing too.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.040
Have you ever seen a cat demon
that cares about camellias?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.560
No.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.580
Neither have I.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.380
You should have tried
to be more convincing.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.800
Right?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.560
Next time.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.630
Let's go.
Xiao Mu has gone into cultivation.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.560
Go back and get some sleep.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.070
He definitely won't find out.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.670
Watch out!

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.159
The Demon-binding Rope?

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.760
Why such a heavy punishment?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.980
If I could leave on my own,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.970
would I need you
to risk yourselves to rescue me?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.310
Alright. Go now.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.770
If Xiao Mu discovers this,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.630
you will be punished just like me.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.270
Hurry. Go.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.190
What are you doing?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.800
You're just leaving
because she told you to?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.430
She didn't...

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.700
Let's think of another way.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920
Don't come back.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.700
Try to make yourself comfortable, okay?

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.890
Let's go. Let's go.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.720
Stop shushing me.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.010
So annoying.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.160
This Demon-binding Rope
can not only trap demons

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.750
but also suppress their spiritual power,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.680
making the captive feel like

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.680
their internal organs
are being crushed by boulders.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.360
What should we do?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.110
Xiao Yao said

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.120
she's fine.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.040
Luoluo,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.120
Xiao Yao only said that to reassure us.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.850
How could she possibly be fine?

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.580
Well...

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.990
what should we do?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.640
With our power,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.850
we can't undo the Demon-binding Rope.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.190
Let's go to Youning Cave.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.270
What for?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.480
To find help.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.490
Help from whom?

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.670
His Lordship. Who else?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.600
My Lord?

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.310
Stay away from me.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.080
When did I

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.190
displease you, My Lord?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.590
You know perfectly well.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.360
I asked you
to teach the minor demons magic,

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.970
not to treat them as enemies.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.340
Xiao Yao's power is still weak,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.440
yet you punished her
with the Demon-binding Rope.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.770
Even a great demon could not endure that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.630
How can she?

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.270
My Lord,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.240
Xiao Yao has grown reckless

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.250
because of your favoritism.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.800
If we don't restrain her now,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.790
what if something goes wrong
in the future?

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.000
Are you going to

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.510
put yourself at risk again?

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.170
Put myself at risk? Nonsense!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.150
I told you to undo it.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.440
Xiao Yao spoke openly for humans today.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.540
Aren't you even a little worried?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.950
What is there to worry about?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.150
Xiao... Xiao Yao...

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.300
has lived among... humans for years.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.240
Of course she has...

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.120
Of course...

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.880
she has more...
experience than the minor demons.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.320
I-If she said... something wrong,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.150
it... was only normal.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.080
N-No need to take it seriously.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.540
You're right, My Lord.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.420
I was being unreasonable.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.330
If you're truly worried about Xiao Yao,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.790
I can

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.630
accompany you to untie her.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.480
That... that...

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.460
That won't... be necessary.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.480
Well... we...

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.600
Don't say anything.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.820
Just run!

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.730
These students today—

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.070
I really can't teach them anymore.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.910
Little grass,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.790
I'm glad I still have you
to keep me company.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.840
Otherwise, this night would be so boring.

With these top marks,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.820
should I report to His Lordship

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.280
and ask him
to undo this Demon-binding Rope?

No.

Going to him for help now

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.770
would be too embarrassing.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.120
You're a minor demon.

he just didn't want to spend money.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.270

Perhaps we should call it a day.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.160
It's getting late. Let's get some rest,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.920
shall we?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.060
One ingot of silver per taste,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.470
until the taste is right.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.310
Deal!

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.750
Xiao Yao.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:44.720
Wake up.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.550
A full day and night should be enough

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.450
for you to reflect on
where you went wrong, right?

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.440
If you admit your mistake,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.300
I'll let you go,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.680
so you won't suffer
more than you can bear.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.790
What did I do wrong?

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.480
I'm doing just fine here.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480
I'm quite at ease.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.970
If you have any more tricks,
bring them on.

You may go.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.640
You're naturally intelligent,

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.500
but you act far too unrestrained.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.040
Plus, you're different
from both humans and demons.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.270
If you do not restrain your nature

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.730
and discipline yourself,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.610
I'm afraid you'll one day
become a calamity to both realms.

Are you leaving or not?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.480
If I truly had the ability
to bring ruin to both realms,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.350
you would not be able to defeat me.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.270
A calamity?

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.830
A calamity can last for ages.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.270

Does it matter?

It does. So last night...

of the 12th lunar month.

Xiao Yao's birthday is coming up.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.620
What do you think we should give her
as a gift?

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.440
I already have it prepared.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.350
I've saved up
lots and lots of delicious treats.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.510
I'll give them all to her

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.510
and let her pick whatever she likes.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.030
You always talk about food.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.640
Once food is eaten,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.480

give her what I think is the best.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.310
You're certainly sincere with Xiao Yao.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.680
You're never willing to give me treats.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.270
If you like them, I can give you some too.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.870
Just keep them for yourself.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.800

is the birthday of an important person.

What a coincidence.
It's a double celebration.

Today

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.350

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.030
on my precious daughter's birthday,

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.429
I would bring her here
for a bowl of noodles.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.400
Her favorite is these

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.980
fried eel noodles.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.360
This is expensive.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.199
How could I afford it?

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.030
I'd buy just one bowl for her to eat.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.440
I told her I didn't like noodles,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.570
and she said, "Dad,"

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.400
"if you don't like noodles,"

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.030
"you can eat the toppings."

in them."

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.960
I knew she was being filial,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.400
and I wanted her to eat more

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.670
and grow up quickly,

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.429
so I pretended to be angry

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.780
to make her eat.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.880
Then she insisted that I eat.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.670

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.960
With one egg,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.710
she ate the yolk

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.510
and I ate the white.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.630
I don't know why,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.440
