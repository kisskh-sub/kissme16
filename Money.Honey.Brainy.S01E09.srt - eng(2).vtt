00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.640
Thank you

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.359
for letting bygones be bygones

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:41.960
and giving me a ride

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.560
You

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.439
what are you doing at Four Seas Tower?

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.479
If it's inconvenient for you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.479
just drop me off at the subway station ahead

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.560
I can get there myself

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:50.359
It's okay

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.640
It's on the way

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:56.399
You still haven't told me

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.479
what you're going there for

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:59.880
I'm going to work

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.760
My boss

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.400
is just a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.799
stupid

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.959
little bastard

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.959
Thank you

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:41.439
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.359
Sorry, sorry

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.519
Why are you here?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.120
I am

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.799
the new

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.599
President's

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.079
Assistant

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.520
Assistant

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.159
This is our President

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.639
Hello, President

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.240
I am Rico from Marketing

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.479
Good

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.599
Let's start the meeting

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.960
Today, you two

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:30.800
are both late

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.680
Don't let it happen again

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.719
Wait a minute

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.520
What's your situation?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.479
When did you come to

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.719
our company to be an assistant?

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.719
First day on the job

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.879
Probation isn't over yet

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.319
Meeting

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.719
Quick

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.639
Rico

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.840
you grabbed some too, right?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.840
Hurry and make him print more

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.520
The village toilet has been out of paper for ages

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.960
Rico

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.120
what do you think of this plan?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.120
It's fine

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.360
Just these few points

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.159
Sorry, sorry

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.159
Sorry

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.680
The President is here, the President is here

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.479
That's not right

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.960
Why is the boss sitting here?

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.400
Strange

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.639
Hello everyone

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.439
Today's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.439
meeting content

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.560
is to discuss with the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.120
colleagues from Marketing

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.039
together about

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.080
Q3 and Q4 product supply

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.560
and marketing

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.639
So first

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.840
let's invite Asher

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.000
to introduce the product supply

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.520
In Q3 and Q4

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520
there are many festivals

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.639
We plan to base it on the festival livestream themes

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.479
and launch some specialty foods

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080
As for the trendy Heritage Food series

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.439
we plan to choose

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.039
Paoda Food Group's

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.319
xiaolongbao and shaomai

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.759
Such an obvious problem

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.960
can't you see it?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.319
Understood

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.959
Heritage Food

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.199
This is a very good approach

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.720
It has selling points

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.720
It has highlights

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.040
And it's delicious

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.839
I really like eating it

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.879
This idiot

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.800
Do you have any

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.360
ideas?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.800
Good morning, everyone.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.639
Regarding the product operation plan,

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.720
I have a few

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.839
minor

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.600
objections.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.600
Is this still the domineering Galileo I know?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.199
Isn't it your first day at work?

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.439
What objections could you possibly have?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.720
What do you know?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.439
Paoda Group's heritage cooked food is indeed good,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.680
but their production methods are completely different.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.879
They only kept the superficial resemblance

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.319
but completely forgot about

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.399
its inner soul.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.959
So my proposal is

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.879
to switch to a different company.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.040
I didn't expect this guy

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.079
to have really done his research.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.480
What do you think?

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.439
I completely agree with your idea.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.720
I think the same as you.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.680
Just as I thought,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.439
this incompetent president

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.480
will definitely run the company into the ground.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.399
As for the dessert series,

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.120
we plan to continue our cooperation with

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.439
Mizhi Group.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.040
No.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.720
Mizhi Group's products

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.120
did indeed sell well in the past,

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.560
but their recent flagship chocolate series

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.240
has mediocre, old-fashioned packaging.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.319
It doesn't match our Four Seas

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.720
newly proposed youthful

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.600
and fun brand identity.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:45.759
Moreover,

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:47.800
they replaced the original dairy cream

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.519
with cheap vegetable cream.

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.519
So,

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:55.800
what's your view?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.639
I also think

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.680
it's not suitable.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.079
Then we can switch to another one.

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:03.920
For example,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.360
Taoyuan Desserts.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.240
Taoyuan Desserts just raised their prices this year.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.279
And then there's

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Lexiong Group.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.680
Lexiong's food safety lawsuit is still ongoing.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.959
Their credibility is low.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.519
This guy is way too bold.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:23.759
In front of so many people,

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.920
directly challenging his own boss.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.160
Impressive, impressive.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.480
He made that little turtle

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.120
look like a total weakling.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.600
As for me,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.040
I've also gathered operational ideas

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.519
for other products in Q3 and Q4.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.800
I'd like to share them with everyone.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.879
First of all,

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.199
we must ensure the use of dairy cream.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.240
This way we can retain

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.680
the majority of our users.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.360
So,

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.240
isn't he handsome?

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.240
I actually think

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.279
this little assistant is more

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.399
handsome.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.839
Little assistant,

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.120
don't you think he talks too much?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.560
Our

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.959
Four Seas Group

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.240
needs a straightforward assistant like him.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.519
Stop arguing.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.839
These two

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.319
I don't get either of them.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.160
So,

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.439
my acting wasn't bad, right?

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.439
A few moments ago were pretty intense.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.399
Good thing our teamwork was smooth and seamless.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.560
I didn't feel it was smooth at all.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.160
So,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.800
why is Xin Tong at our company?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.879
Xin Tong is Rico.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:36.639
Did you know?

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:37.319
I didn't know.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.399
Didn't I ask you to investigate?

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.360
I couldn't find out.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.279
Then why

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.519
don't you want her to know

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.600
that you're the president?

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:05.040
Sis, I keep my promises.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.279
I'll treat you to a big lunch.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:11.920
You're smiling.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.160
That smile of yours is not normal.

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.439
Am I smiling?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.240
Yes.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.240
Happily

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.319
and creepily.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.519
Wen Pei'an,

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:26.920
I'm telling you for sure,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.399
you're in trouble.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:41.080
Hello.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:46.639
So,

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:50.679
working stiff?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.159
Homemade hot pot.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.879
This is the big meal you promised?

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.639
And this is the upgraded version.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.480
Sit down, quick.

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.399
Smell it.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.240
Doesn't it smell good?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.000
Isn't it especially fragrant?

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:17.720
You

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.960
Why did you suddenly come to our Four Seas Group

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.159
to be the President?

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:24.080
No.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.399
To be the President's Assistant.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.399
Isn't your family super rich?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.879
I am.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.440
Don't tell me.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.919
Let me guess.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.279
It must be...

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:39.679
Your dad gave you some kind of mission.

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.440
Tell me.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.720
Wen Pei'an,

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.840
you must find a girlfriend

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:48.559
to inherit our family business.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:49.440
So,

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.799
you found me to be your contract girlfriend,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.559
and you're lying low at Four Seas Group

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.960
to learn,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.600
then go back

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.840
and take over your own group.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.360
Right?

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:01.679
Right.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:05.039
This Four Seas Group

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.840
must be your competitor.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.000
You're here as a mole.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.200
To learn,

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:11.799
mainly to learn.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.639
Well, you picked a really bad time.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.399
Our newly appointed President

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.960
is clearly just a

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.799
hopeless loser who can't be helped.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.559
Being by his side,

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:23.000
you won't learn a thing.

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:26.679
So,

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.039
how's the taste?

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:29.000
Not bad, right?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.960
As long as it's delicious.

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:33.759
As for me,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.679
there's something

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:36.879
I'd like to ask of you.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:39.440
Go ahead.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.879
As long as it's within my power,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.759
I'll definitely help you.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.720
Do you know Qi Xing?

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.200
You mean that

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.600
internet celebrity Qi Xing?

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:51.159
Yes.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.039
I want you to help me persuade that little bastard

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.759
to sign this Qi Xing,

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:57.960
or at least

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.240
do a few live streams with her.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.759
What do you say?

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.960
But I heard she

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.600
lives abroad year-round.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.480
Isn't that just a plane ticket away?

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:08.639
Look at you,

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.799
you're already right there

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:11.720
as the little bastard's assistant.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.720
When you have time, just help me

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.480
put in a good word.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.639
About this matter...

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:17.720
Hold on a second.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:24.919
Qi Xing is back.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.720
What's wrong?

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.480
The little bastard is looking for you.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.080
Well,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.799
then you should eat quickly.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.480
He really holds a grudge.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.000
It wouldn't be good to offend him.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.200
She's really so beautiful.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.799
So gorgeous.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:54.960
Good luck.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:01.399
Does Wen Pei'an know I'm back?

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.120
Of course.

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:03.440
Your every move

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:04.759
is under his control.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.919
Then he must be very nervous.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.120
After all,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.879
I'm his little nemesis.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:16.200
Why come back at this time?

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.639
Is she planning to cause trouble again?
