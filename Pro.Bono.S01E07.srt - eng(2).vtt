PRO BONO

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.021
-I got it!
-My goodness!

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:43.231
You scared me!

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.440
You got what?

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.317
You're innocent.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.486
Of what?

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.822
You're innocent, Mr. Kang! Innocent!

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:56.119
What?

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:00.165
Innocent?

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:01.624
EPISODE 7

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.501
-What do you mean, Gi-ppeum?
-What?

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:07.839
Did you do something wrong?

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:12.093
Why say he's innocent while holding
checkup results? What does that mean?

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.804
Innocent! There's nothing wrong…

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:17.390
No symptoms! I'm clean.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:20.894
She was saying the results
of my colonoscopy came out clean.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:23.813
I recently told Ms. Park

00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:26.107
that I'd been having trouble in my gut

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:28.026
and maybe I got sick
after joining this team.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.736
-So maybe I thought …
-Colorectal cancer?

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.571
-What?
-Cancer?

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:34.157
Cancer all of a sudden?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.035
It's… it's all right.

00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:38.953
The result came out clean.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.665
Maybe I was too stressed
about Kaya's case.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:43.875
Right, Ms. Park?

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:45.627
I'm glad you're okay.

00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:49.213
Were you always that close
with Gi-ppeum though?

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:50.340
What?

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:52.634
You two seemed pretty distant recently.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.595
That's nonsense!

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.599
Ms. Park got worried
and was paying attention to my health.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:00.934
Right, Ms. Park?

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:02.518
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:03.811
That's right.

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:05.521
Yes.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:10.443
It must have been hard
keeping it to yourself

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.612
to not worry the others.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.990
I don't have colorectal cancer
so don't worry.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.245
Hey, you… I mean, Ms. Park.
Why don't we have some coffee

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:21.788
on the rooftop?

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:23.706
Sure.

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:28.419
That was very awkward.

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:29.963
That was very strange.

00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:31.714
What was?

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:36.469
Disband Team Pro Bono.

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:38.513
Father.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.144
Why are you doing this suddenly?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.399
We need Team Pro Bono
to build a new Oh & Partners--

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:52.360
Don't get confused.
You're not my only child.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:58.324
From the cornerstone
to each pillar and brick,

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:02.120
I built Oh & Partners with my own hands.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:05.957
It's the first child I bore and raised
long before you came along.

00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:09.002
Right.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.797
And I'm trying
to turn your precious Oh & Partners

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.342
into a firm that is beloved
by people around the world.

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.971
We can change the firm's image
by using public sentiment a little--

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:21.264
"Beloved"?

00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:22.807
Does that make money?

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.441
Here are the pro bono request statistics.

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:34.819
Ever since Kang joined,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.697
they've increased twentyfold.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.949
They'll complain if we ignore them all,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:44.495
so we have to increase
the number of cases we accept.

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:50.376
Love from the people
who could never become our clients?

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:53.921
That's just cost, not profit.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.216
I only trust the numbers.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:03.389
How much has that team contributed
to our income statement?

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:07.477
How much?

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:23.993
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:28.289
Why don't you just tell the whole team
that I took the apple box with cash…

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.084
They'll be thrilled to see the video

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.795
of me receiving
the apple box full of cash.

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:37.048
Nan-hui would especially make a fuss
and call the cops at once.

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.216
What…

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.636
-I get it now.
-About what?

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.722
No wonder something felt off
every time I watched that video.

00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:48.267
I knew I'd seen something similar before.

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:50.895
What do you mean?
We only met recently.

00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:51.854
Forget it.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.107
Think carefully

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.235
about the endoscopy you got
during your checkup.

00:04:58.194 --> 00:04:59.195
Why?

00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:02.865
Everyone, I'm an attorney.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.326
You have to tell me
the exact size and length

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.413
-of the camera that'll go into my body--
-Is it your first time?

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:11.707
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Everyone's scared their first time.

00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:13.876
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:17.338
Okay, here comes the anesthetic.

00:05:17.422 --> 00:05:19.590
-Ten.
-I'm pretty sensitive.

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.175
-Nine.
-So the anesthetic won't…

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:23.386
Eight.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.513
Seven.

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.557
Six.

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:29.308
Five.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.728
Four, three…

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.063
See?

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.941
My body doesn't respond…

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:38.443
What doesn't respond?

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:42.780
Ms. Park.

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:46.951
You're not getting the endoscopy?

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:52.999
We've already returned to work
after finishing our checkups.

00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:56.669
You're the only one who's late
after making a big fuss.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.758
Gosh, it was so hilarious though.
It's a shame only I saw it.

00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:05.178
What are you talking about?

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:07.597
What?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.390
I was asleep for two hours?

00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:12.518
Did I really get the endoscopy?

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.020
During the whole time,

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:17.356
you made a fuss about suing the doctor
and you thrashed around.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.400
I heard you were very animated.

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:21.527
Did I really sleep here

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:24.030
for two hours?

00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:26.240
But I don't remember a thing.

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:29.952
Right. That was a bit weird,

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:32.663
but what does that have to do
with the apple box?

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:34.582
That's the key.

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:36.542
-A time slip.
-A time slip?

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:40.546
You said you didn't remember anything
about making a scene.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:42.298
I didn't make a…

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.344
I swear I was being put under,
and then I woke up in the recovery room.

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:48.221
That's how anesthesia is.

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:49.805
-What?
-It doesn't make you

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.057
completely unconscious.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.725
It sedates you briefly,

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.728
so you won't remember
what happened during the examination.

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:57.980
It's retrograde amnesia.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:03.444
Are you telling me…

00:07:03.527 --> 00:07:06.864
When you came out of the endoscopy,
you were a total mess.

00:07:08.324 --> 00:07:10.243
-Your face and gestures were peculiar.
-Come on.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:13.663
I had never seen you like that,
but it felt strangely familiar.

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:16.541
I laughed about it back then,
but I get it now.

00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:18.334
The way you looked in that moment…

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:21.879
was just like this.

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:27.552
That's how I looked

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:30.346
-under anesthesia?
-Yes.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.933
My father was exactly like this
after he was put under too.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.519
He wasn't his usual self. He looked drunk.

00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:38.563
Look, Mr. Kang.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:39.730
You're in his arms.

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:43.150
You're practically being carried by him,
as if you're totally drunk.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:46.862
But I did get drunk that night
after a few drinks.

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:50.283
No, you don't completely let yourself go
even when you're drunk.

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:54.579
At our after-work gatherings, your eyes
were always alert even when drunk.

00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:56.414
They kept observing others.

00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:00.209
Is that how I was?

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:02.461
Yes. You have that disturbing stare.

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.505
And look.

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:07.550
You usually don't make
such big gestures when you're drunk.

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:10.469
You always do those kinds of petty moves.

00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:11.429
Like this.

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:13.097
And like this.

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.975
-Like this.
-Come on, "petty" is a bit…

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:18.185
Look again, Mr. Kang.

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:21.731
You never smile this brightly.

00:08:21.814 --> 00:08:25.192
The corners of your mouth
don't go up this high.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:28.154
You've been observing me pretty closely.

00:08:29.071 --> 00:08:30.323
Of course.

00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:31.782
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:08:33.284 --> 00:08:34.952
As you know, my parents are deaf.

00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:36.829
Right.

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:40.249
They talk with their hands
and facial expressions.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.335
If you want a real conversation,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.005
you have to look at others carefully.

00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:48.382
Like this.

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:51.218
I see. So that's why.

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:52.720
Yes.

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:56.557
But the anesthesia for endoscopies

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.643
usually makes you
just talk gibberish in bed.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:01.687
I don't know if it can make you
move around like this.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.692
Maybe it's a similar substance
but more powerful.

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:10.446
So instead of just talking in your sleep,
it makes you sleepwalk.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:16.035
Instead of being drunk from alcohol,
I was drunk from sleep?

00:09:17.662 --> 00:09:21.165
This means he approached you
after researching your childhood.

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:24.585
Who would go to such lengths to do this?

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.753
For what?

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:27.797
Isn't there anyone you suspect?

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:32.968
I think about it
every moment of every day.

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.220
But there are too many.

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:38.224
In the end, being a judge means
you brandish a knife at others.

00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:40.518
There's likely a long list of people

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:42.645
who hold a grudge against me.

00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:45.564
It must've been hard
to deal with that alone.

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:49.193
Well, I've dug around as much as I could,

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:52.071
but things haven't changed much.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:54.573
It's as if I'm in quicksand.

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:56.617
But one thing has changed.

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:57.535
What?

00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:00.121
We're on the same team.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:02.540
Let's find out together.

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:07.461
Not everything is as it seems.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.218
What's with that look?

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:17.346
Did you just swear at me?

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:20.057
I think you did.

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:21.434
Let's go.

00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:23.394
The team will get suspicious of us.

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:29.567
Mr. Kang!

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.944
What took you so long?

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:33.154
What?

00:10:33.863 --> 00:10:37.908
Geez, what's with you?
I said I don't have colorectal cancer.

00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:39.493
What do we do?

00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:41.954
What's going on?

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:44.290
Nan-hui, what is it?

00:10:44.373 --> 00:10:46.792
Why are you overreacting so much?

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:50.045
What? Did someone tell us
to break up the team?

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.093
If no one answers, then that means…

00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:58.345
They do want us to disband.

00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:00.890
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang made the decision himself.

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:01.974
What?

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:03.309
The founder of this firm?

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.939
Then, are we being transferred
to a different team that's profitable?

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:10.232
As if!

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:13.778
They're going to fire us all.

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.071
starting with you, the team leader.

00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:17.281
Da-wit, what do we do?

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:20.326
I have nowhere else to go.
Please go up and say something!

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:21.577
Get off me!

00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.998
ENDING AND DISBANDMENT OF TEAM PRO BONO

00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:27.625
Damn it.

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:35.883
What's the reason?

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:38.344
You can't do this.
You have to make an appointment first.

00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:43.098
Are you Judge Kang?

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.683
I'm sorry, Dr. Oh.

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:45.768
It's all right.

00:11:46.894 --> 00:11:48.229
You can go, Ms. Seo.

00:11:48.312 --> 00:11:49.438
Yes, sir.

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:03.619
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,
the chair of the bar association.

00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:07.081
The founder of Korea's biggest firm,
Oh & Partners.

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.502
The giant among giants who controls
the legal world from the shadows.

00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.504
No, not a giant. A monster.

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:18.384
I wanted to thank you earlier
but you were on a business trip overseas.

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:19.468
Sure.

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.929
I allowed you to register as an attorney

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:25.724
because Jung-in kept pestering me to,
which was unlike her.

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:29.270
Then, why are you kicking me out now

00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:30.604
after taking me in?

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:32.439
You know,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.777
I've worked my whole life
in the legal industry,

00:12:37.403 --> 00:12:40.864
and I don't want it to be a place
where corrupt judges and prosecutors

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:42.157
can resign and hide.

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:45.619
I can't bear to watch it anymore.

00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:48.205
Of course, I'm talking about the video.

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:55.421
You know that's not it.

00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:00.634
You knew about the video from the start.

00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:05.014
How did you know he came to see me?

00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:12.229
Ms. Seo, I need to see you for a moment.

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:20.154
Did you ask for me, sir?

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:21.989
Thanks for everything.

00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:25.743
-Today will be your last day.
-Pardon?

00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:28.245
-Sir!
-Call the security team

00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:32.666
so they can take back your laptop
and other equipment

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.709
within 30 minutes.

00:13:34.627 --> 00:13:36.378
Did I do something wrong?

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:39.673
You'll have to hurry to pack your stuff.

00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:42.635
Yes, sir.

00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:55.981
Was that really necessary?

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:57.900
You know very well

00:13:57.983 --> 00:14:01.320
I love receiving information
about other people.

00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:03.781
But I despise employees

00:14:03.864 --> 00:14:06.867
who tell others about my visitors.

00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:26.011
What on earth could be the reason?
We've been doing great lately.

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:27.429
Exactly.

00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:29.974
We've been on a winning streak
since Mr. Kang's been here.

00:14:30.057 --> 00:14:32.226
Pro bono cases
have never been this popular.

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:34.144
Other pro bono attorneys
are so happy, so why?

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.146
That could be the reason.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.232
What do you mean, Mr. Jang?

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:40.985
Hey, what did you mean?

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:44.279
Why are you cleaning wheels right now?

00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:49.243
I heard attorneys from other teams
have been speaking ill of us.

00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:51.954
They didn't like
that we used the firm's name

00:14:52.037 --> 00:14:53.789
because we don't have
elite qualifications.

00:14:53.872 --> 00:14:56.792
"We can't have those losers
keep representing our firm on the news."

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.254
That's embarrassing for them.
Did they really say that?

00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:02.548
Well, they're not totally wrong.

00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:06.927
-Hey!
-Also, Ms. Oh made our team.

00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:10.431
Do the other partners really want us…

00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:12.933
to succeed?

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:17.062
But still, she is Dr. Oh's daughter.

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:19.565
Why would he do this
to a team his daughter made?

00:15:20.232 --> 00:15:23.068
You took Mr. Kang in
despite knowing everything.

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:25.446
Please reconsider your decision.

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:35.080
His team is in charge of the entire firm's
mandatory public service hours.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:37.958
Do you know how much money
we save from that?

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.209
That's not the problem.

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:41.754
The more high-end a brand is,

00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:46.050
the more they make people wait
to even enter and look around the store.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:49.178
When it's less accessible,
we get to control the price.

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:51.055
What empowers us

00:15:51.138 --> 00:15:55.142
is jealousy, envy, and fear,
not love from the people.

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:58.145
But you're making it easier

00:15:58.228 --> 00:16:01.732
for people to bring up
our firm so casually

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.401
by gathering low-class losers

00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:07.821
to represent a dog, a kid with disability,

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:10.741
and an illegal alien.

00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:14.495
I thought I'd taught you enough
about how power works.

00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:17.122
Are you dumb?

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.751
Or have you become weak
like your dead mother?

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:27.257
I'll prove it with numbers.

00:16:29.176 --> 00:16:31.178
-What?
-I just need to show you

00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:33.097
that we can be profitable, right?

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.264
How about this?

00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:37.768
Baekseung Law Firm has been
close behind Oh & Partners in revenue.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.479
What if we can take away their clients?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.065
Mr. Kang.

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:44.733
Hey, Judge Kang.

00:16:44.817 --> 00:16:47.402
I like to gamble too,

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:52.157
but one needs something at stake
to make a bet work.

00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:54.159
I've already ordered the disbandment.

00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:58.747
If we lose,

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:03.127
we'll disband the team for free.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.419
For free?

00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:06.380
If you force us to disband,

00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:09.550
I'll immediately sue you
for wrongful termination.

00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:13.428
And of course,
I'll drag it out as much as possible

00:17:13.512 --> 00:17:14.805
until your costs pile up.

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:17.808
How interesting.

00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:27.901
Please let me know. I'll wait.

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:33.115
Also,

00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:35.576
let me correct one thing.

00:17:36.326 --> 00:17:38.745
The person we represented, Kaya,
wasn't an illegal alien.

00:17:39.413 --> 00:17:43.125
She came to Korea legitimately
with a marriage visa.

00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:48.547
I was taught that fact-checking
is a basic requirement for any attorney.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:56.972
A bet?

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:00.726
Sounds good.

00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:08.942
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

00:18:09.026 --> 00:18:10.903
Don't worry. You trust me, right?

00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:12.362
Yes.

00:18:15.073 --> 00:18:16.742
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:21.747
-By the way, Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

00:18:22.414 --> 00:18:24.708
You're so handsome.

00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:29.922
What?

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:34.760
Hey, handsome lawyer man.

00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:37.554
Why are you blushing?

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:39.181
Well, I'm not ugly.

00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:41.433
-My goodness.
-Yeong-sil.

00:18:43.435 --> 00:18:45.020
She's Song Ji-hye, isn't she?

00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:46.939
I heard a social worker sent her to you.

00:18:47.022 --> 00:18:50.150
Yes. Ji-hye has
a Grade 3 intellectual disability,

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.736
and her parents passed away
from a car accident.

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:53.987
Goodness.

00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:55.113
Really?

00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.493
Gather around.

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:01.578
I have something to tell you.

00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:04.957
A competition?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.127
We're pro bono attorneys.
We're people who defend the weak.

00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:11.713
Baekseung only handles cases
with tax-evading chaebols

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:13.715
and corporate raiders
who conduct mass layoffs.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.342
You want us to take that kind of case?

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:18.387
Do you know who Mr. Jang
just agreed to represent?

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.180
An abused intellectually disabled person.

00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:23.267
We're attorneys
who help those kinds of people.

00:19:26.228 --> 00:19:30.315
We're the ones getting laid off here.
We're the weak.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:33.193
Can't you think of it
as defending ourselves?

00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:36.530
But you should've made a bet we could win.

00:19:36.613 --> 00:19:38.073
If we lose this epically,

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:40.409
someone like me
won't be able to find another job.

00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:42.244
We'll just win then!

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:51.420
Yes, this is Team Pro Bono. Sorry?

00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:54.047
Yes.

00:19:56.174 --> 00:20:00.470
Mr. Bae wants all of us
to come to the conference room at once.

00:20:00.554 --> 00:20:01.638
Right now?

00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:05.392
It's almost time,
so take care of it quickly.

00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:11.606
-Hello.
-Hello, sir!

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:12.524
Hello.

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:15.277
Why did you need us so urgently?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.905
Attorney Kang, I heard you made
an "adorable" proposal to Dr. Oh.

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:21.992
You promised to beat Baekseung
to secure a case?

00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:27.414
Yes, "whatever" case that maybe.

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:31.001
Really? "Any" case, right?

00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:35.172
How may I help you?

00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:37.424
We have an appointment
with Oh & Partners at noon.

00:20:39.885 --> 00:20:40.886
You mean her?

00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:58.278
We happen to have a meeting today,
so give it your best.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.572
They're coming here
after meeting with Baekseung.

00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:03.492
You suddenly called us here
to meet with a client?

00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:05.535
What? The first meeting's
only for introductions.

00:21:06.953 --> 00:21:10.040
You made a bet with Dr. Oh
without even having that much confidence?

00:21:10.665 --> 00:21:13.794
Keep your word and disband the team
without any complaints if you lose.

00:21:15.212 --> 00:21:16.671
They should be here by now.

00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:18.632
-Why are you standing like that? Sit.
-Right.

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:19.800
Behave yourselves.

00:21:19.883 --> 00:21:22.052
Don't make a scene or scream.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:23.720
Scream?

00:21:24.346 --> 00:21:25.430
Hello.

00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:26.473
It's Elijah.

00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:34.106
Oh, my gosh! It's Elijah! I'm a big fan!

00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:35.774
Elijah!

00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:38.985
-What's going on?
-Sir, Elijah is here.

00:21:39.528 --> 00:21:40.654
-Elijah?
-Yes!

00:21:40.737 --> 00:21:41.905
-"Korea's sweetheart"?
-Yes!

00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:43.407
Let's go take a photo!

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:45.951
They must be here.

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:48.036
Goodness, welcome.

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:49.913
Hello.

00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:52.582
No way.

00:21:54.918 --> 00:21:57.379
It's Elijah. What is she doing here?

00:21:59.047 --> 00:21:59.923
I'm sorry.

00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:03.552
Mr. Hwang's a big fan,
so he must've gotten excited for a moment.

00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:06.054
-I'm not late, am I?
-No, it's all right.

00:22:06.763 --> 00:22:10.142
Hello, I'm Attorney Bae Yong-hun
of Oh & Partners.

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:11.059
Nice to meet you.

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:12.769
-I'm Cha Jin-hui.
-Hello, sir.

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.314
By the way, who are these people?

00:22:16.398 --> 00:22:18.108
-Right.
-Hello.

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:22.404
I'm Attorney Kang Da-wit,
former chief judge

00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:25.240
of Seoul Central District Court.

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:26.241
I see.

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:28.201
Hello, I'm Park Gi-ppeum.

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:29.244
Okay.

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:31.329
I'm Hwang Jun-u. I'm a big fan.

00:22:31.413 --> 00:22:34.624
I'm Jang Yeong-sil.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.795
Geez. Why do I smell oil?

00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:41.673
I'm sorry. I was in the middle of work
before I came.

00:22:42.257 --> 00:22:46.970
-I'm sorry.
-The vibe of Oh & Partners' attorneys is…

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:49.848
very colorful.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.685
Everyone at Baekseung Law Firm
went to SNU Law School.

00:22:53.768 --> 00:22:56.438
Their team leader is
a former CID prosecutor from the SPO.

00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:58.690
The SPO's
Central Investigation Department?

00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:01.067
Mr. Woo Myeong-hun?

00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.277
Yes.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.114
I assume you obviously went to SNU
if you're a former chief judge?

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.079
Am I wrong?

00:23:14.998 --> 00:23:19.419
I specifically asked for a team
with the best attorneys.

00:23:19.502 --> 00:23:22.380
Ms. Cha, this team's been
on a roll these days.

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:25.425
You must've seen them on the news.
Team Pro Bono.

00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:27.802
Team Pro Bono?

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:30.972
From that abandoned dog case?

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:33.016
-That…
-Yes!

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:36.186
Yes, we handled that case.

00:23:36.853 --> 00:23:40.732
Wait, did you bring me a team
that handles dog cases?

00:23:41.566 --> 00:23:42.943
I knew it.

00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:45.654
You can't bring in nobodies like this.

00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.740
"Nobodies"?

00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:52.410
We're not the people
who can be called nobodies.

00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:54.496
I'm sure you have heard about me.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:55.872
The people's judge--

00:23:56.873 --> 00:23:57.916
What?

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:03.922
You can't just give yourself
such a title like that.

00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:08.009
I didn't give myself the title.
Then, let me explain in detail.

00:24:08.093 --> 00:24:10.845
The number of my followers is--

00:24:13.098 --> 00:24:14.140
I'm sorry.

00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:17.394
Our team leader's had to pull
a lot of all-nighters these days.

00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:18.478
-You must be tired.
-No.

00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.147
Shall we begin the meeting
after a short break?

00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:22.899
-We just met.
-Okay, come here.

00:24:22.983 --> 00:24:25.652
Elijah, I'm a big fan. It's such an honor.

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:27.654
-Ms. Park, why…
-Come here.

00:24:27.737 --> 00:24:29.447
-Wait, that's not…
-You're so heavy.

00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:31.199
Ms. Park, what I meant was…

00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:32.367
Let go of me.

00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:34.536
Will you hear me out?

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:36.579
She keeps saying
Seoul National University.

00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:39.040
What, did she graduate
from an elite school

00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:40.959
to become a celebrity?

00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.086
-Elijah goes to a prestigious university.
-Yes.

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:45.213
-Really?
-Yes.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:48.758
How many followers does she have then?

00:24:48.842 --> 00:24:51.052
Ms. Park, I have 380,000 followers now.

00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:54.848
She has 25 million.

00:24:57.851 --> 00:24:59.811
25 MILLION FOLLOWERS

00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:03.773
Mr. Kang, who was
the last K-pop idol you liked?

00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:12.741
-Tell me--
-Mr. Kang!

00:25:12.824 --> 00:25:15.243
How can you not know Elijah,
"Korea's sweetheart"

00:25:15.327 --> 00:25:17.579
and the one everyone wishes
was their daughter?

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:20.165
An angel with a beautiful smile
who donates to charities,

00:25:20.248 --> 00:25:22.792
she got into a top college
while working hard as an idol.

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:24.794
Elijah is every parent's dream!

00:25:25.712 --> 00:25:27.589
Why are you so quiet? This isn't like you.

00:25:27.672 --> 00:25:29.174
Don't you know who Elijah is?

00:25:29.257 --> 00:25:30.633
-Am I supposed to know?
-Well?

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:34.262
Anyway, her group was disbanded
three years ago,

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:36.639
and she debuted
as a solo artist last year.

00:25:36.723 --> 00:25:38.767
EK Entertainment CEO Cha Jin-hui
is her mother.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.478
And company director Kim Ju-won
is her brother.

00:25:41.561 --> 00:25:43.188
Those years as a nerd really help.

00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:47.442
Save it. When you go inside,
you better be on alert.

00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:49.569
You saw how they belittled us.

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:52.572
Fix your tie too.

00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.157
Let's go. Move out.

00:25:54.908 --> 00:25:56.034
Let's go!

00:25:56.117 --> 00:26:01.331
You said earlier we're pro bono attorneys
who defend the weak.

00:26:02.248 --> 00:26:05.001
They don't look that weak at all.

00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:08.546
Since we're here anyway,
we'll explain the situation.

00:26:09.214 --> 00:26:10.590
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:26:14.344 --> 00:26:17.555
I'm going to take videos again today.

00:26:17.639 --> 00:26:19.224
-Yeah.
-She is so pretty.

00:26:19.307 --> 00:26:22.310
Elijah!

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:24.813
Elijah, can you take off your cap?

00:26:24.896 --> 00:26:25.855
Fuck!

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:34.030
I'm sorry.

00:26:36.199 --> 00:26:37.742
What's wrong, Elijah?

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.077
Are you okay? Did something--

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.746
Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!

00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:44.416
Get lost.

00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.918
I said fuck off!

00:26:53.591 --> 00:26:54.968
Were you surprised?

00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:58.221
I'm pretty good at cursing.
And colorfully too.

00:26:58.304 --> 00:26:59.556
Stay still, Elijah.

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:01.850
Their parents want to sue Elijah,

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:05.603
claiming their daughters
were hospitalized due to shock.

00:27:05.687 --> 00:27:06.938
If this gets out of hand,

00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.315
all her endorsement deals
will be terminated,

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:11.526
and she'll have to pay
billions of won in penalties.

00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:15.029
Her recent ambassador deal
with a luxury brand will be canceled too.

00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:18.616
There's also an internet channel
that's been harassing her since long ago.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.410
I told you, everyone.

00:27:20.493 --> 00:27:23.413
This is all plastic surgery and editing.

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:25.165
Korea's sweetheart, my foot.

00:27:25.707 --> 00:27:30.628
Okay, everyone. Now, I will reveal
Elijah's before photos.

00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:33.173
How much facial contouring did she do?

00:27:33.256 --> 00:27:35.884
With that much surgery,
isn't she more robot than human?

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:39.888
The whole country is being fooled by her.

00:27:39.971 --> 00:27:44.601
The Cyber Crusader
will uncover the truth on this channel.

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:47.061
Make sure to turn on notifications,
like, and subscribe!

00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:48.980
My goodness.

00:27:49.606 --> 00:27:52.817
Those are downright lies, of course.

00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:54.944
If they get a hold of this video,

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:58.448
these lies will turn into the truth.

00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.866
The public jumps to conclusions.

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:01.117
By the way,

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:04.662
who took this video?

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:06.831
There must be a camera that recorded it.

00:28:07.624 --> 00:28:09.459
Right. This one?

00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:14.506
Yes, her whole body is in frame,
so it was taken from ten meters away.

00:28:14.589 --> 00:28:15.715
Elijah didn't notice

00:28:16.382 --> 00:28:18.760
that there was a camera at all.

00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:20.720
You think we didn't follow up on it?

00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:23.515
-What?
-The driver of the taxi the girls rented

00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:25.141
took it with the girl's phone.

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:27.393
They rented a taxi?

00:28:27.477 --> 00:28:30.104
Yes, because it was 3:00 in the morning.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.483
She gave the phone to the driver
to film them meeting Elijah.

00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:36.861
The video hasn't spread yet?

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:40.281
Some of the parents
are using the video to ask for money,

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:42.909
but we've stopped it
from circulating for now.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:45.245
Don't worry, Elijah.
I'll make sure nothing gets out.

00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:48.748
Just focus on preparing
for the album, okay?

00:28:58.508 --> 00:29:01.135
Well, the first match was a total defeat.

00:29:01.219 --> 00:29:02.929
They didn't even take our business cards.

00:29:03.012 --> 00:29:06.224
They suddenly called us
when we weren't even ready.

00:29:06.307 --> 00:29:07.141
That was so unfair.

00:29:07.225 --> 00:29:09.477
They don't want us to win at all.

00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:11.896
Are we going to be disbanded
before we even get a chance?

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:16.943
-What's my name?
-Sorry?

00:29:17.777 --> 00:29:20.238
-What is my name?
-What is he doing?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.201
Aren't you Mr. Kang Da-wit?

00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:28.997
Yes. It's Da-wit, like David,
who beat the giant Goliath.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.166
I'm getting tired
of saying it now, okay? We…

00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:35.169
-will win no matter what.
-Yes.

00:29:37.213 --> 00:29:39.966
Sure, sure. As you know,

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:41.342
I'm always…

00:29:42.176 --> 00:29:43.595
full of faith.

00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:46.055
What's gotten into you?

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:48.516
But my job is at stake
this time, Mr. Kang.

00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.185
Instead of a vague speech,

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:53.646
you should give us specific measures.

00:29:54.272 --> 00:29:57.108
-Jun-u, why are you so worked up--
-Why wouldn't I be?

00:29:57.859 --> 00:30:00.987
What on earth made you make that bet?

00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:08.661
Mushrooms.

00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:11.205
-Anger issues.
-Hey!

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:13.875
A serious nerd and a tall idiot.

00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:16.794
How are we going to beat
a mega law firm?

00:30:16.878 --> 00:30:18.004
What's with you?

00:30:18.087 --> 00:30:19.422
-Calm down.
-Let go of me.

00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:20.924
-Sorry, he's drunk.
-I'm not drunk.

00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:22.550
-Sit down.
-I'm not drunk!

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:27.889
Am I wrong?

00:30:29.307 --> 00:30:31.809
You've done well your entire life,

00:30:31.893 --> 00:30:34.979
so the whole world
is like a joke to you, isn't it?

00:30:35.063 --> 00:30:40.193
This team might be like a hobby for you,
but I tried four times to get this job.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:43.404
This job is my lifeline!

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:51.663
This team is my lifeline too.

00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:54.207
What?

00:30:55.792 --> 00:30:59.379
I was fired after getting blackmailed
with a video of me taking a bribe.

00:31:00.171 --> 00:31:01.714
Then, I came here.

00:31:13.267 --> 00:31:15.061
I've been pushed to the brink too.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.447
I'm sorry.

00:31:27.156 --> 00:31:28.533
I should have told you before.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.493
We're on the same team.

00:31:31.327 --> 00:31:33.830
But you knew about it, Gi-ppeum.

00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:35.957
-Well…
-Yeah.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.125
I'm sorry.

00:31:38.126 --> 00:31:39.460
As I told you,

00:31:40.128 --> 00:31:43.172
I ended up seeing the video very suddenly.

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:45.466
I couldn't tell you because I wasn't sure.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.094
Is your judgment
the only one that matters?

00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:51.389
You should have asked for our opinions.

00:31:55.351 --> 00:31:58.521
We ended up working
with a person under suspicion,

00:31:58.604 --> 00:32:01.024
and it was for public interest cases.

00:32:01.816 --> 00:32:02.692
Nan-hui, that's--

00:32:02.775 --> 00:32:05.486
It's not her fault. It's all my fault.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.780
I should've told you sooner

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:09.991
and let you decide.

00:32:12.952 --> 00:32:14.662
We'll need to discuss it among ourselves.

00:32:15.913 --> 00:32:17.540
This was very unexpected.

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:19.792
Right.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.544
Go ahead and discuss.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.551
I'll step aside.

00:32:37.393 --> 00:32:38.770
Me too?

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:42.440
Okay.

00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:44.025
All right.

00:32:50.573 --> 00:32:54.160
Geez, why on earth did you bring that up?

00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:55.953
It's either you do or you die.

00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:58.122
We can't win if we can't unite.

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.625
But it's too risky.

00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:03.544
The two of us should've tracked down
the culprit first.

00:33:03.628 --> 00:33:06.547
We needed to check the number
that sent the video to me.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.219
Ms. Park, I'll handle it
on my own from now on.

00:33:11.302 --> 00:33:14.097
-Don't get involved anymore.
-Mr. Kang.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.515
It's dangerous.

00:33:15.598 --> 00:33:19.143
The culprit did this to someone
who was a chief judge at the time.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.771
And he probably didn't do it alone.

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:25.900
But you are alone.

00:33:26.943 --> 00:33:28.152
You believed me.

00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:29.862
That's enough for me.

00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:33.199
Mr. Kang!

00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:36.619
Okay.

00:33:37.537 --> 00:33:39.413
Let's talk again later.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.422
The use of sedative makes sense,
but it's still just a theory.

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:50.424
That's true.

00:33:51.008 --> 00:33:52.510
But we can't be certain

00:33:52.593 --> 00:33:55.388
that Mr. Kang accepted a bribe
based on that one video.

00:33:56.848 --> 00:33:59.767
There are strange circumstances
that Ms. Park found too.

00:34:06.274 --> 00:34:09.527
We've decided to presume
you're innocent until proven guilty.

00:34:10.194 --> 00:34:11.028
Ms. Yoo.

00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:13.698
If what you claim is true,

00:34:14.824 --> 00:34:17.743
it means you're an innocent victim
who was unfairly framed.

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:21.831
As a pro bono attorney,
I can't ignore such a person.

00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:28.045
-Ms. Yoo.
-Of course, I don't totally trust you.

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:29.797
Although I've decided to trust you,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.050
I'll keep my eye on how things go.

00:34:34.302 --> 00:34:35.136
Ms. Yoo.

00:34:37.305 --> 00:34:39.098
I was a bit worked up before.

00:34:39.765 --> 00:34:40.600
I'm sorry.

00:34:41.893 --> 00:34:44.520
But honestly,
I'm very disappointed in you, Mr. Kang.

00:34:45.104 --> 00:34:49.942
You kept saying we were a team,
but you didn't trust us at all.

00:34:54.447 --> 00:34:55.448
I'm sorry.

00:34:56.365 --> 00:34:57.575
I was a coward.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.370
To be honest, I was afraid

00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:04.957
because I thought
none of you would believe me.

00:35:05.041 --> 00:35:07.335
-Honestly, I didn't really trust you.
-What?

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.587
-Mr. Jang.
-Mr. Jang?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.506
Every pro bono attorney
has their own reason

00:35:13.257 --> 00:35:14.717
for choosing this job.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.552
But for Mr. Kang,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.554
I couldn't find his.

00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:22.892
"Why did he force himself
to take a job he didn't want to do?"

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:26.187
"There must be some other reason

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.523
for using this job as a stepping stone."

00:35:31.192 --> 00:35:35.112
Why didn't you ever ask me
why I took this job?

00:35:35.196 --> 00:35:37.615
Does the intent really matter?

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:39.951
What?

00:35:40.034 --> 00:35:43.037
You don't need a license
to be a good person and do good things.

00:35:43.663 --> 00:35:45.665
No matter what may be the case,

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:50.544
you've given it your best
and done well as a pro bono attorney.

00:35:50.628 --> 00:35:53.714
It's okay to wait to see how someone acts
before you criticize them.

00:35:53.798 --> 00:35:57.677
You don't know what their intentions are,
so what's the point of doubting them?

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:03.391
-Mr. Jang…
-On top of that,

00:36:04.225 --> 00:36:05.476
you're obviously not the type

00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:08.729
to accept a bribe so openly.

00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:10.147
-That's true.
-Yeah.

00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:14.235
He'd cleverly cook up multiple ways
to get away with it before taking one.

00:36:14.318 --> 00:36:16.487
Right? I knew I wasn't
the only one who thought so.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:17.655
Yeah.

00:36:19.323 --> 00:36:20.283
What…

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.662
What on earth
did you think of me all this time?

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.122
-A petty--
-Miser.

00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:28.874
-A scrooge.
-An apple box…

00:36:30.418 --> 00:36:32.712
Forget about that.
Treat us to drinks tonight.

00:36:32.795 --> 00:36:35.339
Let have the petty one buy us a drink.

00:36:35.423 --> 00:36:37.758
Okay, tonight's talk ends here.

00:36:37.842 --> 00:36:40.219
When I say "Pro bono,"
you'll say "Let's go."

00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:43.222
-Pro Bono!
-Let's go!

00:36:44.098 --> 00:36:46.726
That didn't really feel…

00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:48.978
Fine. Let's go.

00:36:50.021 --> 00:36:51.731
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:37:01.157 --> 00:37:03.868
-I'll go out to the scene of the incident.
-Okay. Good.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.871
Are you going to check online, Mr. Jang?

00:37:09.957 --> 00:37:11.459
Mr. Kang.

00:37:11.542 --> 00:37:13.169
-Yes?
-What are you looking at?

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:14.420
Well…

00:37:15.963 --> 00:37:17.631
What are you doing? You're in the way.

00:37:22.136 --> 00:37:23.179
What?

00:37:23.262 --> 00:37:24.555
Why are you all so free?

00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:26.390
-What brings you here?
-What do you think?

00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:29.101
-You got crushed at the first meeting?
-Geez.

00:37:29.977 --> 00:37:30.978
It wasn't that bad.

00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:33.356
I barely appeased Ms. Cha
and got a second meeting.

00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:35.858
It's at EK Entertainment this time.

00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:38.027
You'll pitch against Baekseung.

00:37:38.694 --> 00:37:40.654
What? A pitch?

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.823
Come with me, everyone.

00:37:42.907 --> 00:37:44.533
Now? Where to all of a sudden?

00:37:45.076 --> 00:37:46.285
To get ready for battle.

00:37:51.832 --> 00:37:52.833
I'll get going.

00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:57.380
They look so expensive.

00:38:04.136 --> 00:38:06.555
This kind of outfit
actually suits you, Ms. Park.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.349
But Ms. Oh,

00:38:08.432 --> 00:38:10.351
the price isn't written here.

00:38:10.434 --> 00:38:11.894
Don't worry about that.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.730
How could I not worry?
You know how much my salary is.

00:38:14.814 --> 00:38:18.984
Just win. If you lose,
that will be your severance pay.

00:38:19.527 --> 00:38:20.945
Oh, my gosh. It's that expensive?

00:38:25.783 --> 00:38:26.909
Ms. Park.

00:38:26.992 --> 00:38:27.910
-How do I look?
-Move.

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:34.583
This is a nice color.

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.836
Are you going to bring
all your team members?

00:38:38.504 --> 00:38:41.507
-What?
-The client's fussy about qualifications.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.426
How about going
with just Ms. Park this time?

00:38:46.262 --> 00:38:48.180
They're my team.
They each have their own role.

00:38:48.848 --> 00:38:49.682
Is that so?

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:51.392
Gosh, this…

00:38:51.475 --> 00:38:52.643
-What?
-This looks cool.

00:38:52.726 --> 00:38:54.103
How's this? How do I look?

00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:56.522
-Is this over your card limit?
-No way.

00:38:57.064 --> 00:38:59.275
Excuse me. Please pay for all of them.

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:00.317
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:01.068 --> 00:39:02.820
The CEO's company card.

00:39:03.696 --> 00:39:05.448
-Hold on.
-Yes?

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:11.328
Thank you for the other day with Dad.

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:14.123
Don't mention it.

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:17.793
Good luck.

00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:19.962
Don't embarrass me.

00:39:27.511 --> 00:39:29.138
So, what's your solution?

00:39:29.221 --> 00:39:30.514
We believe

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:33.309
the best option is to fix things
as quickly as possible.

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:37.730
We'll meet with the girls' parents,
pay them an adequate settlement,

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:41.108
and get them to sign an NDA
and an agreement

00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:43.611
to not file any civil
or criminal lawsuits.

00:39:43.694 --> 00:39:46.697
"The signatory will not file
any civil or criminal lawsuits

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.282
on this matter in the future."

00:39:48.866 --> 00:39:49.700
It's neat and clean.

00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:54.580
But aren't we giving
too much money for the settlement?

00:39:55.623 --> 00:39:58.334
Why do we have to pay them so much
for a broken camera?

00:39:58.417 --> 00:40:02.087
You have to consider
the cost of Elijah's public image.

00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:03.255
That's right, Ju-won.

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.091
It's about your sister.
We shouldn't save our pennies.

00:40:06.175 --> 00:40:07.676
Still…

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.179
Oh & Partners are a bit late.

00:40:28.864 --> 00:40:31.992
Why are they walking
in a flying V formation?

00:40:34.203 --> 00:40:35.329
What on earth?

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:49.218
Are they the same team?

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:56.809
Where are they?

00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:57.726
I see them.

00:40:58.352 --> 00:40:59.353
Me too.

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.441
Sorry, we're late. We're Team Pro Bono.

00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:07.027
You're the same team from before?

00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:09.697
Yes. We are, Elijah.

00:41:10.281 --> 00:41:12.533
Were you on a makeover show or something?

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:15.119
For an attorney,

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.122
a suit is like armor.

00:41:18.747 --> 00:41:19.582
Cool.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.378
From now on,
we'll be protecting you, Elijah.

00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:26.255
Just be on time.

00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:33.095
I guess you were stunned
after I beat you. What was that?

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:35.097
A suit of armor?

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.141
Do you know each other? Same university?

00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:41.729
He's a legendary figure.

00:41:41.812 --> 00:41:44.231
He was appointed to court
with only a high school degree.

00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:46.483
How amazing is that?

00:41:47.735 --> 00:41:48.736
You must be kidding.

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:54.700
No, he's right.
I only have a high school diploma.

00:41:54.783 --> 00:41:57.202
I knew you didn't go to SNU, but…

00:41:58.871 --> 00:42:02.041
If the team leader didn't go to college,
what about the others?

00:42:02.124 --> 00:42:04.752
Ms. Park Gi-ppeum graduated
from SNU Law School.

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:06.629
And what about you?

00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:10.257
Well, I…

00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:13.135
You might not be familiar with it.

00:42:13.218 --> 00:42:14.053
It's far down…

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:15.721
in the south.

00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:19.725
In the south. Isn't that amazing?

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:23.062
They ignore academic and work backgrounds.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.567
Do you litigate with your college diploma?

00:42:28.651 --> 00:42:30.319
Not at all.

00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:32.946
I go in fully prepared.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.281
I see.

00:42:34.365 --> 00:42:36.867
We have warned the parents already.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:40.412
"If the video leaks, you'll face a lawsuit

00:42:40.496 --> 00:42:44.583
demanding a devastating amount of money
from Baekseung Law Firm."

00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:45.709
So don't worry about it.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.630
You're way too confident about this.

00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:52.800
-What?
-That kind of video

00:42:52.883 --> 00:42:55.260
is like a knife that could stab someone.

00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:58.305
No matter what, once the knife is made,

00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:00.724
it'll end up stabbing someone.

00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:03.268
Did something happen?

00:43:04.812 --> 00:43:07.147
To prepare contingency plans,

00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:08.816
our team has been monitoring

00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:11.110
the changes in traffic of her fansite

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:12.945
and related pages in real time.

00:43:13.612 --> 00:43:16.907
Mr. Jang here once made an app
for such things.

00:43:17.908 --> 00:43:21.120
I just checked traffic on my way here,

00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:23.330
and on Cyber Crusader's channel,

00:43:23.914 --> 00:43:25.666
this video was uploaded.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:27.751
What?

00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:32.256
Hey, didn't you say
you took care of the parents?

00:43:32.339 --> 00:43:35.092
I did, and I sufficiently warned them.
The situation--

00:43:35.175 --> 00:43:38.220
Did you check the taxi driver's phone too?

00:43:38.303 --> 00:43:41.056
He shot it with the phone
one of the girls gave him.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.182
Don't you get it?

00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:46.520
The taxi driver took it
with his own phone and sent it.

00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:52.693
In K-pop idol fandom, there's something
called an "ST." You know that, right?

00:43:56.947 --> 00:43:58.115
An ST?

00:43:59.032 --> 00:44:01.076
It's short for "stalker taxi."

00:44:01.702 --> 00:44:04.580
These sasaeng fans, or obsessive fans,

00:44:04.663 --> 00:44:07.291
use these taxis to stalk celebrities.

00:44:07.374 --> 00:44:10.794
It means he wasn't just
a regular taxi driver.

00:44:10.878 --> 00:44:14.423
Do you think someone like that
would stay quiet after shooting a video

00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:16.133
that will make him a fortune?

00:44:17.551 --> 00:44:22.264
I guess not enough research
was done on the client's industry.

00:44:24.308 --> 00:44:26.518
Ms. Cha, you don't have to worry.

00:44:26.602 --> 00:44:28.020
We can handle this.

00:44:28.103 --> 00:44:29.021
How?

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:30.981
They said it's already been uploaded!

00:44:31.064 --> 00:44:34.443
We'll send a certified letter
in our firm's name to the channel owner.

00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:36.653
"Take it down immediately,
or you'll be held liable."

00:44:36.737 --> 00:44:38.989
"Take the video down,
and let's meet to settle."

00:44:39.573 --> 00:44:40.783
I'll make sure to resolve it.

00:44:40.866 --> 00:44:44.119
It's probably spread
all over the place by now!

00:44:44.203 --> 00:44:46.747
You should admit your daughter
to a hospital for now.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.664
What?

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.251
"Due to severe insomnia and anxiety
caused by exhaustion from her tour

00:44:51.335 --> 00:44:54.630
and her new album preparation,
she wasn't thinking straight."

00:44:55.297 --> 00:44:57.549
"Her doctors ordered her to rest,
so she was admitted."

00:44:57.633 --> 00:45:00.302
"But there is no excuse
for committing a huge mistake

00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.679
of treating her fans like this."

00:45:02.763 --> 00:45:06.558
"She deeply apologizes to everyone
who are disappointed."

00:45:06.642 --> 00:45:07.476
And then,

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.813
she needs to cry cutely
at the right moment.

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:17.110
You want me to "cry cutely"?

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:23.200
My choice of words was a bit poor.
I apologize.

00:45:23.283 --> 00:45:26.495
The important thing is
we need to keep emotions out of this

00:45:26.578 --> 00:45:29.122
and give the public what they want

00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:30.958
as quickly as possible.

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:35.420
Isn't it important
to set all the facts straight first?

00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:39.174
What do you mean?

00:45:39.258 --> 00:45:40.467
To see if anything was missed,

00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.636
I went to the security office
of her apartment.

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:44.596
I watched
the surveillance footage all night.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.808
It wasn't the girls' first time there.

00:45:51.353 --> 00:45:52.813
Hey, when is she coming out?

00:45:52.896 --> 00:45:56.066
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

00:45:56.149 --> 00:45:57.818
Come on. It's not her.

00:45:57.901 --> 00:45:59.444
-Shut up, bitch.
-Are you blind?

00:45:59.528 --> 00:46:00.696
You're here again?

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:04.408
I warned you I'd call the cops next time.

00:46:04.491 --> 00:46:06.535
You'll call the cops on us?

00:46:06.618 --> 00:46:08.245
What? Who are you to say that, old lady?

00:46:08.328 --> 00:46:10.497
Hey, she's the stylist
who stopped us before.

00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:14.376
Right. I remember that fucking ugly face.

00:46:14.459 --> 00:46:17.087
A mere stylist calling the cops on us?
What the hell?

00:46:18.213 --> 00:46:19.881
Get lost, minion.

00:46:19.965 --> 00:46:21.341
You're hopeless.

00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:22.801
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

00:46:23.343 --> 00:46:25.470
You aren't her fans. This is a crime.

00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:28.432
-Move the fucking phone.
-Taking secret photos in vans.

00:46:28.515 --> 00:46:29.850
-Stealing things.
-I said move it.

00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:32.019
-You fucking bitch, seriously!
-Nice.

00:46:32.102 --> 00:46:33.103
-Kick her.
-Give it.

00:46:34.521 --> 00:46:36.106
Ms. Cha.

00:46:37.482 --> 00:46:41.528
You didn't mention anything about this.

00:46:43.614 --> 00:46:45.991
This is what
the entertainment business is like.

00:46:46.074 --> 00:46:47.909
Public image is what matters.

00:46:47.993 --> 00:46:51.622
Even if we pick a fight and say
the high school students were wrong first,

00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:53.248
we're the ones who take the hit.

00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:59.713
The best thing to do is
to settle the matter quickly and quietly.

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:06.053
I bet it is since it's more important
for you to cover up something else.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.554
Elijah!

00:47:07.638 --> 00:47:09.848
Cover up? What do you mean?

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.018
On the night I threw that camera,

00:47:13.101 --> 00:47:15.187
-I wasn't coming down from my place.
-Are you nuts?

00:47:15.979 --> 00:47:17.230
Sit down. I'm an adult now.

00:47:17.314 --> 00:47:19.232
Mr. Kim, sit down.

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.985
Elijah.

00:47:22.569 --> 00:47:24.905
You'll know
when you check the phone video.

00:47:24.988 --> 00:47:26.615
I live in Building 101.

00:47:26.698 --> 00:47:29.076
But I came out
of Building 103's elevator that night

00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:30.494
from my boyfriend's place.

00:47:33.246 --> 00:47:34.331
Hold on.

00:47:34.414 --> 00:47:37.042
This is a completely different situation.

00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:39.795
If that news breaks
on top of everything else,

00:47:39.878 --> 00:47:42.923
this will seriously damage
the brand that is Elijah.

00:47:43.006 --> 00:47:45.300
She's a person, not a brand.

00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:52.474
Before being a product,
she is a human being.

00:47:52.557 --> 00:47:54.518
An adult woman in her twenties.

00:47:57.229 --> 00:48:00.732
Her stylist is like a big sister,
and she's her best friend.

00:48:02.526 --> 00:48:03.819
She may have the face of a baby,

00:48:03.902 --> 00:48:06.571
but she's a strong woman
who can't overlook injustice.

00:48:07.072 --> 00:48:09.991
She's someone
who went to Yeouido by herself,

00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:13.328
wrapped in a scarf and with a candle,
because she just couldn't sit back.

00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:14.871
That kind of person!

00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:16.415
Jesus Christ.

00:48:16.498 --> 00:48:19.000
You want to put her in a hospital
for mental instability

00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:22.421
and make an apology video
with her crying cutely?

00:48:22.504 --> 00:48:24.423
You can't treat another person that way.

00:48:25.048 --> 00:48:26.675
Why is she rampaging like this?

00:48:26.758 --> 00:48:28.093
Just keep quiet.

00:48:30.846 --> 00:48:32.264
Miss, by any chance,

00:48:33.098 --> 00:48:34.516
are you a Ponies member?

00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:36.810
Yes.

00:48:37.477 --> 00:48:38.437
For three years.

00:48:41.648 --> 00:48:43.275
-"Ponies"?
-It's her fan club.

00:48:43.358 --> 00:48:44.359
I see.

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:48.947
I've never told anyone about my stylist.

00:48:50.615 --> 00:48:51.825
Did you…

00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:54.703
come to a fansign
after I put out my solo album?

00:48:54.786 --> 00:48:56.538
-"Fansign"?
-A meet-and-greet event.

00:48:58.331 --> 00:49:01.835
You said you're pro bono attorneys?
That means public interest cases.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.756
That's right.

00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:08.592
You're the cowardly big sis, aren't you?

00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:10.051
-Cowardly?
-Cowardly?

00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:10.969
What?

00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:13.388
How do you know me?

00:49:22.189 --> 00:49:23.356
TO YOO NAN-HUI
BEST WISHES

00:49:25.317 --> 00:49:26.276
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT

00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.865
You want to be a pro bono attorney?

00:49:31.948 --> 00:49:32.866
Yes.

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:35.327
-That's incredible.
-Not at all.

00:49:37.704 --> 00:49:38.747
Is there a special reason?

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:44.336
It's because I'm a coward.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.254
-What?
-In seventh grade,

00:49:46.338 --> 00:49:48.215
I was bullied.

00:49:48.298 --> 00:49:49.925
You were bullied?

00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:51.635
Yes.

00:49:51.718 --> 00:49:55.764
I guess I was an easy target
because I was small and weak.

00:50:03.021 --> 00:50:05.524
Bring all of them here next time.

00:50:05.607 --> 00:50:06.983
I'll kill them all.

00:50:12.697 --> 00:50:13.824
It must've been really hard.

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:18.453
Yes.

00:50:24.918 --> 00:50:27.045
Actually, I…

00:50:27.128 --> 00:50:30.048
People call me sensitive

00:50:30.131 --> 00:50:32.300
and say I make a big deal
out of everything.

00:50:32.384 --> 00:50:34.761
Frankly, it's all because
I'm a big coward.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.557
I'm sensitive to crimes
because I'm afraid of violence.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.770
I'm sensitive to discrimination
because I hate rudeness and disrespect.

00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:46.356
I'm really afraid of the world.

00:50:50.026 --> 00:50:52.112
That's why I want to be
a pro bono attorney.

00:50:52.737 --> 00:50:54.489
I want to build a world…

00:50:55.907 --> 00:50:59.327
where even cowards like me
can live happily.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.374
Hey, big sis.

00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:06.793
You're really amazing.

00:51:06.877 --> 00:51:08.795
No, I'm not.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.464
You are.

00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:19.472
You really remember me?

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:20.473
Of course!

00:51:20.557 --> 00:51:23.268
I remember all of you
because you give me so much love.

00:51:23.351 --> 00:51:27.147
I'm nothing but one of the fans
who just passed by though.

00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:30.734
I told you back then
not to be afraid of anything.

00:51:30.817 --> 00:51:33.486
I promised I'd protect all the Ponies.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:36.489
Big sis.

00:51:38.366 --> 00:51:39.951
I missed you so much!

00:51:41.161 --> 00:51:43.288
-Big sis.
-Isn't Nan-hui the older one?

00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:45.540
You're the big sister
if you're the cool one.

00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:48.084
Well, this is a strange development.

00:51:48.168 --> 00:51:50.712
This wasn't part of our plans.

00:51:50.795 --> 00:51:52.047
Can I give you a hug too?

00:51:52.964 --> 00:51:54.215
Of course!

00:51:58.428 --> 00:52:02.057
Mr. Kang, didn't you say Nan-hui
could be the key to this case?

00:52:02.766 --> 00:52:03.642
I did.

00:52:03.725 --> 00:52:05.435
What are you doing? You're in the way.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.654
Of course, she's on my team.

00:52:15.737 --> 00:52:16.947
You're unbelievable, sir.

00:52:22.327 --> 00:52:23.286
Yoo Nan-hui.

00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:27.582
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:29.751
CIVIL SUIT FOR DAMAGES

00:52:30.502 --> 00:52:33.213
-What is it?
-He looks familiar.

00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:37.634
Defense counsel.

00:52:37.717 --> 00:52:40.178
If you have something to say,
please state your case.

00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:43.473
Yes, Your Honor.

00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:44.641
This trial

00:52:44.724 --> 00:52:47.936
is tyranny by powerful people
to infringe on the people's right to know

00:52:48.019 --> 00:52:49.604
and their freedom of expression.

00:52:49.688 --> 00:52:51.648
We ask that you dismiss
the plaintiff's claim.

00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:53.900
-Who are the powerful people?
-Who do you think?

00:52:54.818 --> 00:52:57.153
The star beloved by the people.

00:52:57.988 --> 00:53:00.490
If Elijah's not the powerful person,
who else would it be?

00:53:00.573 --> 00:53:04.911
Is it fun to appoint
a former chief judge as an attorney

00:53:04.995 --> 00:53:07.539
and oppress a mere YouTube creator?

00:53:08.373 --> 00:53:09.582
A hundred million for damages?

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:14.129
This is violence to silence the public.

00:53:14.212 --> 00:53:16.423
That's right!
One hundred million won is no joke!

00:53:16.506 --> 00:53:17.632
Please lower your voice.

00:53:17.716 --> 00:53:19.968
You are here before the court.

00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:23.346
Yes, this is the court of truth.

00:53:25.056 --> 00:53:27.475
I, Ma Yeong-suk the Cyber Crusader,

00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:32.772
am ready to be martyred
at any moment for the truth.

00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:38.069
Truth? Is this the truth
you're talking about?

00:53:39.863 --> 00:53:41.489
Breaking news, everyone!

00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:45.785
The Cyber Crusader's got
the biggest scoop for you today.

00:53:45.869 --> 00:53:50.582
Have you all seen that real video
of Elijah uploaded last week?

00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:54.210
Korea's sweetheart
can curse pretty viciously, can't she?

00:53:54.294 --> 00:53:56.838
Do you know when the video was shot?

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.883
It was three in the morning.

00:53:59.966 --> 00:54:01.468
And at that time,

00:54:01.551 --> 00:54:05.764
where was Korea's innocent sweetheart
coming down from?

00:54:05.847 --> 00:54:08.433
None other than his house.

00:54:08.516 --> 00:54:10.727
Ta-da! You know him, right?

00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:14.814
What did our Elijah do in her rapper
boyfriend's house until 3:00 a.m.?

00:54:14.898 --> 00:54:16.274
Did she get a rap lesson?

00:54:16.357 --> 00:54:18.359
Or was it a different kind of lesson?

00:54:18.443 --> 00:54:19.903
My goodness.

00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:22.530
It's so dirty, I can't watch.

00:54:22.614 --> 00:54:24.282
Is this the truth you were talking about?

00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:26.409
Prying into one's privacy?

00:54:26.493 --> 00:54:28.411
She's a public figure,
so she should bear it.

00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:31.498
Did someone force her
at knifepoint to be a celebrity?

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.585
If she doesn't want the attention,
she should live quietly as a civilian.

00:54:35.668 --> 00:54:38.671
What is the meaning of "public figure"?

00:54:39.297 --> 00:54:41.508
Of course, a public figure is…

00:54:42.092 --> 00:54:45.136
According to
the Standard Korean Language Dictionary,

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.305
it means "a person engaged
in public service."

00:54:47.388 --> 00:54:50.058
But celebrities make money
from popularity with the public--

00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:53.561
So if one earns money from the public,
they're public figures?

00:54:53.645 --> 00:54:56.439
The lady selling sundae-guk out front
must be a public figure too.

00:54:56.523 --> 00:55:00.485
She makes a fortune every day
from hundreds of people.

00:55:01.194 --> 00:55:03.738
How can you compare
some mom-and-pop store to her?

00:55:03.822 --> 00:55:05.865
Is scale the issue now?

00:55:05.949 --> 00:55:08.660
What about the CEO who makes money
by selling phones to everyone?

00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:11.538
What about the CEOs who make money
selling clothes or cosmetics?

00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:14.916
Thanks to popularity with the public,
they make tons of money.

00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:16.835
They must be public figures too then?

00:55:16.918 --> 00:55:19.796
But why aren't you
digging through their private lives

00:55:19.879 --> 00:55:21.172
or leaving nasty comments?

00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:24.634
You're afraid
their legal teams will sue you

00:55:24.717 --> 00:55:25.844
for huge financial payments.

00:55:25.927 --> 00:55:27.428
They're not as weak as celebrities.

00:55:27.512 --> 00:55:28.388
Am I wrong?

00:55:28.471 --> 00:55:30.598
What are you doing, Counsel?

00:55:30.682 --> 00:55:33.059
Are you saying stars
are the same as ordinary people?

00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:35.019
A celebrity's every move is always--

00:55:35.103 --> 00:55:38.523
You're right.
They receive everyone's attention.

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:41.317
It's true their jobs
have a big influence on society.

00:55:41.943 --> 00:55:45.071
That's why they're more careful
not to be a bad influence.

00:55:45.155 --> 00:55:48.116
And since they're beloved,
when they do wrong,

00:55:48.199 --> 00:55:49.701
they endure heavy criticism.

00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:54.747
Still, they're not obligated
to endure such malicious twisting of facts

00:55:54.831 --> 00:55:56.499
and groundless humiliation.

00:55:56.583 --> 00:56:01.671
Before Elijah is a star,
she's a human being with rights.

00:56:01.754 --> 00:56:04.007
Yes, she's a person.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.885
A person who does things like this
to young high school girls.

00:56:06.968 --> 00:56:09.137
The public is entitled to know.

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:12.640
Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!

00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:17.312
Get lost. I said fuck off!

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.148
Yeah, that is her.

00:56:25.653 --> 00:56:28.031
Yes, the public is entitled to know.

00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:31.451
You're hopeless.

00:56:31.534 --> 00:56:33.745
You aren't her fans. This is a crime.

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:36.664
-Move the fucking phone.
-Taking secret photos in vans.

00:56:36.748 --> 00:56:37.665
Stealing things.

00:56:41.085 --> 00:56:43.880
Well, what do you say?

00:56:43.963 --> 00:56:47.258
I don't think you can find words
that better describe the situation

00:56:47.342 --> 00:56:50.428
than the ones Elijah used earlier.

00:56:50.929 --> 00:56:53.223
"Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!"

00:56:55.016 --> 00:56:56.726
-What?
-Ms. Park.

00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:58.269
Plaintiff's counsel! What are you…

00:56:58.353 --> 00:57:00.021
It was a quote.

00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:01.314
Yes.

00:57:03.358 --> 00:57:04.692
Please don't be upset.

00:57:06.986 --> 00:57:09.113
Are you looking down on the public?

00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:13.159
The public is enraged
by her despicable hypocrisy.

00:57:13.243 --> 00:57:16.496
-Sit down.
-She always says she loves her fans.

00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:18.831
And this is how she repays her fans' love?

00:57:18.915 --> 00:57:21.626
They're not fans. They are criminals.

00:57:21.709 --> 00:57:22.669
They're still minors,

00:57:22.752 --> 00:57:24.963
but we'll hold their parents
legally responsible.

00:57:25.547 --> 00:57:28.383
But the public is condemning Elijah--

00:57:28.466 --> 00:57:32.011
You keep saying "the public."

00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:33.930
Who is that really?

00:57:34.013 --> 00:57:36.224
The public is the public.

00:57:36.307 --> 00:57:37.809
Numerous people.

00:57:37.892 --> 00:57:40.228
How many people does it take?
Is there a number?

00:57:40.311 --> 00:57:42.146
The public is
an unspecified number of people.

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.357
Are you going to
keep quibbling over words?

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.402
When you go
to any major entertainment site,

00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:49.529
hundreds of people are commenting on them.

00:57:49.612 --> 00:57:54.325
The public is made up of many people
who make up the majority of society.

00:57:54.951 --> 00:57:58.121
Your Honor, may I ask a question?

00:57:59.163 --> 00:58:00.415
Thank you.

00:58:01.082 --> 00:58:03.543
Out of everyone here in court,

00:58:04.168 --> 00:58:06.337
is there anyone
who has ever left a comment

00:58:06.421 --> 00:58:07.880
on a celebrity news article?

00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:09.048
Could you raise your hands?

00:58:09.132 --> 00:58:10.341
-Not me.
-Me neither.

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:13.177
No one.

00:58:13.803 --> 00:58:16.472
Your Honor,
have you ever left a comment before?

00:58:16.556 --> 00:58:17.599
That's enough, Counsel.

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:20.018
You haven't. I understand.

00:58:21.269 --> 00:58:23.521
That is so strange.

00:58:23.605 --> 00:58:27.233
Of the many people who make up
the majority of society,

00:58:27.317 --> 00:58:29.986
why isn't a single one here?

00:58:30.653 --> 00:58:33.990
Still, have you seen the comments?
Have you read what they say?

00:58:34.073 --> 00:58:35.742
Yes. Comments like these, right?

00:58:39.287 --> 00:58:40.204
Goodness.

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:43.750
"Didn't she fix her whole face?"

00:58:43.833 --> 00:58:45.293
"How blessed she is."

00:58:45.376 --> 00:58:47.837
"The blessing of Korean doctors."

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.006
She's the most overrated these days.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.383
She pretended to be pretty and kind.

00:58:52.467 --> 00:58:54.427
Admit you got plastic surgery first.

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:57.847
"Did she make all those donations
to evade taxes?"

00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:03.728
I wonder how many people there are

00:59:04.312 --> 00:59:06.022
who leave comments like these.

00:59:06.606 --> 00:59:10.318
Are they really the only ones
who make up the public?

00:59:10.943 --> 00:59:14.405
There are people
who don't even know Elijah at all.

00:59:14.489 --> 00:59:17.450
There are those
who love her music quietly.

00:59:17.533 --> 00:59:21.204
There are many
who frown upon comments like these.

00:59:21.704 --> 00:59:26.542
Ms. Ma, did you at least take
a public survey from every citizen?

00:59:26.626 --> 00:59:28.461
On what premises

00:59:28.544 --> 00:59:30.963
do you dare to represent
the public's opinion?

00:59:31.047 --> 00:59:32.423
-That's--
-Don't.

00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:42.517
Your Honor, may I ask our team's Ms. Yoo
to make arguments from now on?

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.102
Yes, you may proceed.

00:59:46.187 --> 00:59:47.355
Ms. Yoo.

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:49.524
Yes, sir.

00:59:57.573 --> 00:59:59.659
I've always been curious.

01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:02.495
Those persistent comments online.

01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:05.540
How many people are actually behind them?

01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:10.128
Are we mistaking an anonymous minority
for the unspecified majority?

01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:12.046
So, we've verified it

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.550
with the help of our colleague
with exceptional IT skills.

01:00:18.803 --> 01:00:21.097
We've marked the IP addresses

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.308
of those who wrote
these anonymous posts and comments

01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:26.769
with cute animal icons.

01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:28.479
Like this.

01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:35.737
Why are they the same?

01:00:36.362 --> 01:00:38.573
-It's a rat.
-Did one person write them all?

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:40.992
Do you see these mice icons?

01:00:41.743 --> 01:00:42.910
Isn't it shocking?

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:45.329
Out of 250 comments,

01:00:45.413 --> 01:00:47.957
the same person wrote 168 of them.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.169
Moreover, this same person
is the one who made the post.

01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:55.965
So, we tracked the address just in case,
and to our surprise…

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.430
it was the same IP address
as the Cyber Crusader's channel.

01:01:05.933 --> 01:01:07.185
They were totally made up.

01:01:07.268 --> 01:01:10.354
You're so diligent. I'll give you that.

01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:13.149
You wrote a lot of posts too.

01:01:13.232 --> 01:01:15.401
Your writing skills were superb.
For example…

01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:20.865
"Am I the only one
who thinks Ma Yeong-suk is pretty?"

01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:23.493
"I think she's so pretty too."

01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:26.329
"Yeah, she is so stylish
and sophisticated."

01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:29.373
"Honestly, aside from age, Ma Yeong-suk…"

01:01:29.457 --> 01:01:31.417
-"is better than Elijah."
-She must be crazy.

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:37.757
They're all fabricated.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.091
She did that all by herself?

01:01:39.175 --> 01:01:41.385
-Has she nothing else to do?
-That is so embarrassing.

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:43.387
-Seriously.
-That's so…

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:44.764
What an intense life you have.

01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:52.355
Your Honor, when people see
celebrities like Elijah,

01:01:52.438 --> 01:01:54.357
they scream their names and envy them.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.235
But they're actually lonelier
and weaker than anyone else.

01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:01.739
Even as they bleed
from the dagger-like words of people

01:02:01.823 --> 01:02:03.366
who speak recklessly about others,

01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:06.327
it's not easy for them
to say that it hurts.

01:02:08.162 --> 01:02:09.413
Think about it.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:13.543
How many times have we lost

01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:16.712
those lonely and vulnerable stars

01:02:18.798 --> 01:02:20.424
that shined…

01:02:22.593 --> 01:02:24.554
so brightly?

01:02:28.391 --> 01:02:32.144
Does the price for popularity
have to be that cruel?

01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:40.945
Ms. Ma.

01:02:42.572 --> 01:02:44.407
You must take responsibility now

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.493
for that persistent spite
and obsession of yours.

01:02:49.704 --> 01:02:51.831
What did I do that was so wrong?

01:02:52.456 --> 01:02:53.416
What?

01:02:53.499 --> 01:02:56.127
I only fought
for the public's right to know!

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.713
At least, I don't hide in the shadows
like a coward!

01:03:00.756 --> 01:03:04.427
My client is not a coward
who hides in the shadows.

01:03:06.804 --> 01:03:08.222
Please come in.

01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:14.186
Oh, my gosh!

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.187
-It's Elijah!
-Elijah!

01:03:18.274 --> 01:03:19.692
Order in the court!

01:03:19.775 --> 01:03:22.486
-Bailiff.
-Order in the court!

01:03:23.738 --> 01:03:25.907
Is the plaintiff
attending the trial in person?

01:03:29.201 --> 01:03:31.829
Yes, Your Honor.
My apologies for being late.

01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:40.671
Your Honor, the plaintiff would like
to share something.

01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:43.299
May she have a chance to speak?

01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:45.176
You may proceed.

01:03:56.312 --> 01:04:00.358
First off, I apologize to everyone
who was disappointed in me

01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:01.442
because of this incident.

01:04:09.033 --> 01:04:10.576
No matter what the reason was,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.913
it was my fault for cursing
and throwing stuff

01:04:14.747 --> 01:04:16.040
at the young students.

01:04:16.123 --> 01:04:18.542
I will compensate them for all damages

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:19.835
and apologize to them.

01:04:20.628 --> 01:04:23.631
I will become a more mature person
so that I won't let down

01:04:24.548 --> 01:04:26.342
those who support and love me.

01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:35.476
But here…

01:04:41.315 --> 01:04:43.067
I'll call her the defendant.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.195
I have something to say to the defendant.

01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:47.113
Okay.

01:04:51.993 --> 01:04:53.327
I am standing

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:55.663
right in front of you.

01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:58.499
Look me in the eyes,

01:05:00.292 --> 01:05:01.502
and do it.

01:05:02.044 --> 01:05:02.878
Do what?

01:05:03.879 --> 01:05:05.715
All those things

01:05:05.798 --> 01:05:07.800
you have said about me.

01:05:09.969 --> 01:05:11.387
The lies.

01:05:14.223 --> 01:05:15.641
Those filthy words.

01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:19.812
Those words didn't hurt just me.

01:05:22.648 --> 01:05:24.275
They hurt my fans,

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.528
who I love more than anyone else.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:37.997
Elijah! I'm a fan
who supports you from Japan.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.293
I'm working on my own dreams
as I listen to your music.

01:05:42.376 --> 01:05:45.337
So, please stay strong!

01:05:45.421 --> 01:05:49.550
There are many more fans who love you,
so don't worry and trust in us.

01:05:49.633 --> 01:05:52.178
Elijah, I love you. Stay strong.

01:05:52.261 --> 01:05:54.764
I'll protect you. Good luck.

01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:58.225
When I was at my lowest,
your songs cheered me up.

01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:59.602
-I love Elijah.
-I love you.

01:05:59.685 --> 01:06:01.437
-Let's go!
-Stay strong!

01:06:02.146 --> 01:06:05.024
-We'll protect you, Elijah!
-Ponies are always by your side!

01:06:05.107 --> 01:06:06.150
Hang in there!

01:06:06.233 --> 01:06:09.070
We love you, Elijah!

01:06:09.153 --> 01:06:10.362
Go, Elijah!

01:06:10.446 --> 01:06:12.031
-Elijah, let's go!
-We love you!

01:06:12.114 --> 01:06:14.492
-Hang in there!
-We love you! Stay strong!

01:06:22.249 --> 01:06:25.711
Okay, then. Say it to my face now.

01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:31.425
Those awful words that hurt

01:06:31.509 --> 01:06:33.511
the ones who love my music quietly

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:37.765
and the ones who trust and love me.

01:06:37.848 --> 01:06:40.976
Look me in the eyes and say them

01:06:43.145 --> 01:06:47.316
instead of cowardly hiding
behind the mask you call "the public."

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.244
Gosh, Elijah is so tough.

01:06:59.245 --> 01:07:02.540
This is why I can't stop loving her.

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:07.211
Your eyes are boring through her.

01:07:23.519 --> 01:07:27.273
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

01:07:27.356 --> 01:07:28.190
Judge Kang.

01:07:30.192 --> 01:07:32.820
I mean, Attorney Kang.

01:07:32.903 --> 01:07:33.779
What is it?

01:07:35.656 --> 01:07:37.616
Are you really going to
see this to the end?

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.244
We'll stop now
if you pay the 100 million at once.

01:07:41.036 --> 01:07:42.371
Let's stop here.

01:07:42.454 --> 01:07:44.999
It won't benefit either side to continue.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:46.792
I don't think so.

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:48.544
We'll have many benefits.

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:51.714
We were thinking

01:07:51.797 --> 01:07:56.010
of taking all the cases from every star
who's been harassed by the defendant.

01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:00.681
Do you know

01:08:00.764 --> 01:08:03.934
who informed us about Elijah's boyfriend?

01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:06.896
Do you?

01:08:07.688 --> 01:08:11.442
Who is this person
that you're taking so long to reveal?

01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:16.614
There she comes.

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.824
It's her.

01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:23.037
Ms. Cha Jin-hui.

01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:25.331
Pick whichever one you need.

01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:27.958
Elijah!

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:30.920
My goodness, congratulations!

01:08:33.088 --> 01:08:36.842
-Congratulations!
-Elijah's mother tipped us off herself.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.761
Do you know that?

01:08:39.762 --> 01:08:44.058
I had been so angry
because of Ma Yeong-suk.

01:08:45.809 --> 01:08:46.936
How did you make time?

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:49.730
Well, I just had to come, of course.

01:08:56.362 --> 01:08:58.155
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

01:09:16.257 --> 01:09:17.341
But they're family.

01:09:17.424 --> 01:09:19.134
How could a parent
do that to her child?

01:09:19.218 --> 01:09:21.262
Drive those losers away, okay?

01:09:21.345 --> 01:09:22.972
Elijah, what brings you here?

01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:25.140
I want to end the exclusive contract
with my company.

01:09:25.224 --> 01:09:26.225
Please file a lawsuit.

01:09:26.308 --> 01:09:27.851
What have I done that was so wrong?

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.437
I've only done my best for my daughter.

01:09:30.521 --> 01:09:32.815
We tracked it down,
and it was a life insurance plan.

01:09:32.898 --> 01:09:34.191
A life insurance for Elijah.

01:09:34.275 --> 01:09:36.485
Wasn't the failed investment
due to accounting fraud?

01:09:36.568 --> 01:09:38.445
No! Those were all fabricated!

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:39.947
Exemption of Crimes by Family.

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:43.575
Property crimes committed
within family cannot be punished.

01:09:43.659 --> 01:09:45.160
Just please sue me.

01:09:45.244 --> 01:09:47.288
Elijah. Is this what you wanted?

01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:49.164
Stop that lawsuit at once.

01:09:49.248 --> 01:09:50.207
And break up the team.

01:09:50.291 --> 01:09:53.168
Mr. Kang. We have to do something.

01:09:53.252 --> 01:09:54.378
Let's go.

01:09:54.461 --> 01:09:55.921
The biggest stage would be…

01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:57.506
Let's go to the National Assembly.

01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:01.677
Mr. Kang…

01:10:03.554 --> 01:10:04.847
Park Gi-ppeum.

01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:08.851
How can you do this to me?

01:10:11.186 --> 01:10:13.439
Of all people,
you should've trusted me.

01:10:15.858 --> 01:10:17.401
You didn't trust me,

01:10:18.068 --> 01:10:19.194
so it made me upset.

01:10:23.699 --> 01:10:24.575
I'm sad.

01:10:26.577 --> 01:10:27.703
Oh, my gosh!

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:29.330
-Nurse! He's…
-Yes.

01:10:29.413 --> 01:10:31.290
The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.126
Is that so?

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.380
I'm so upset.

01:10:38.464 --> 01:10:39.882
I'm hurt.

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.843
I'm so hurt.

01:10:44.386 --> 01:10:46.013
You hurt my feelings.

01:10:47.514 --> 01:10:48.557
I feel so sad.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.482
