00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.249
Please. I beg you.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.769
Please save him.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.889
I'm begging you.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.969
Please save him.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.049
She loved him so much.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.129
She knelt for three days
and three nights to beg for medicine.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.850
But in the end, he killed her.

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:08.568
Yes.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.249
If you knew the one you love
would betray you someday,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.609
even kill you,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.290
would you still save him?

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:15.970
I would.

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:17.290
Why?

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.849
Because the sincerity
of this very moment

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.529
is worth trading a life for.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.369
Was it worth it?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.929
When you truly love someone,

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.290
you don't ask whether it's worth it.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.369
Congratulations on passing
the second trial.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.850
But the third trial is the hardest.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.970
Because it requires you
to let go of your obsession.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.450
Are you willing?

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.250
Lead the way.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.724
(Medicine)

00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:00.757
(Chrysanthemum)

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.929
This is my third trial.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.290
This medicine can cure all poisons,

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.530
but it requires a life in exchange.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.728
Do you know why I have lived 90 years

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.369
yet still look like a child?

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.768
Because you mastered
the art of preserving youth.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.889
No.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.048
It's because I severed love and desire.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.570
Love ages a person the fastest.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.450
Saving him will shorten your lifespan.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.929
Are you willing?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.410
Qingru.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.850
Qingru.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.369
To save your life,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.728
she paid with her own.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.010
She's already gone.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.450
If anything happens to her,

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.450
I will never forgive you.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.450
Stop!

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.609
Since you and I have met,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.530
it is a pact of a hundred years.

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.369
Alive, we walk together.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.730
Dead, we return together.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.329
If you betray me,

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.690
even in the netherworld,

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.690
I will seek you out for reckoning.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.090
In this life,

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.248

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.769

Yuwen Que.

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:44.649
Tell me,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.489
why did you return to Mobei back then?

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:55.090
At the time, my father ordered me
to marry Princess Wen Ling.

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.009
I would rather give up my status
as a prince,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.410
only to ask Father's permission.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.569
Preposterous!

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.529
For a common woman,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.170
you would abandon your royal identity?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.128
Yes. To me, Ru

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.170
is far more important than royal status.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:10.369
Guards!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.369
Escort the Crown Prince
to Chengguang Hall.

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:14.849
Without my decree,

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.689
he is not to take a single step outside.

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:18.049
So

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:20.730
you were imprisoned.

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:22.449
Yes.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.290
My father ordered me
to marry Princess Wen Ling.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.650
To escape the marriage,
I went to the battlefield.

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.730
When I finally escaped,

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.330
I heard about what happened
to your mother.

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.049
And you were nowhere to be found.

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:39.530
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:42.689
I didn't want our identities
to stand in our way.

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:45.329
I thought as long as I gave up
my status as a prince,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.449
we could live in peace together.

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:51.449
In fact, those rumors were deliberately
spread by His Majesty.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:54.970
What did you say?

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.129
His Majesty didn't want to see you
fall in love with a Mobei prince,

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.170
so he deliberately released assassins
from Mobei to kill her.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.049
He just didn't expect that you would...

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:08.249
So,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.249
all of this was orchestrated
by him alone?

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.608
Just to...

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:16.730
Even His Majesty didn't expect
that this move

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.728
would doom you beyond redemption.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:19.890
Stop talking.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.290
Actually, you later found out as well

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.890
that my mother
was killed by my own father.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.049
Why did all of you hide it from me?

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:33.929
Yuwen Que.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.529
Do you know how much
I've hated you all these years?

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.290
I know. I'd rather you hate me.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.650
I only want you to live.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:46.969
You're no match for the Emperor.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.129
I don't want to watch you die
for revenge.

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:52.569
Why?

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.650
Why did he treat us like this?

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.970
Di.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.168
I bought this at the market.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:20.569
They say it wards off evil.

00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:24.290
Young lady, you're the best.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.129
After all these years,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.650
you still keep it?

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:32.808
Young lady, I...

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.489
Let bygones be bygones.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.169
Actually, all these years,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.569
I was ordered by the Emperor
to protect you and your mother.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.250
So all these years of friendship
were merely a duty?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.368
No.

00:08:52.369 --> 00:08:53.650
I never...

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.729
Cui Di.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:59.890
Our bond ends here.

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.969
Young lady, please listen to me.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:04.049
From this day on,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.929
we are no longer friends.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.530
All these years, it was thanks
to Cui Di staying by your side.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.729
She's the person I trust the most.

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:38.650
More than me?

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.610
The dignified Crown Prince of Mobei,

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:47.290
actually getting jealous
of my female guard.

00:09:48.249 --> 00:09:49.408
In front of you,

00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:51.250
I am only Yuwen Que.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.049
Young lady, I'll take my leave first.

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:01.049
By the way, I want to see your sword.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.530
This is the Cangyu Sword.

00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:13.049
Forged from refined steel
of Cangzhou and quenched with jade.

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:15.130
But isn't the Cangyu Sword...

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.449
That's right.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.569
It's a tribute sent from Cangzhou
to Mobei every year.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.410
Only five exist in the entire realm.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.049
Yuwen Que.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.770
Don't blame me.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.890
Young lady, you can't enter the palace.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.488
Step aside.

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:14.728
He is the Emperor,

00:11:14.729 --> 00:11:15.969
your biological father.
