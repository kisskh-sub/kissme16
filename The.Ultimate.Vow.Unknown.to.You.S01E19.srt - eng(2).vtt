00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:10.794
If you dare touch her,

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:13.354
first ask if my sword agrees.

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:19.434
Attack!

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:52.634
If you die here,

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.195
I'll make sure you never rest in peace.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.554
Dying by your hand would be an honor.

00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:00.274
But dying at the hands
of these lowlifes...

00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:01.595
Do you dare?

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:03.593
Go, now!

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:04.714
Live well.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.540
- No.
- I won't leave with this life alone.

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:12.475
Yuwen Que!

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:15.394
Yuwen Que!

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:19.114
I want to see

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:20.755
who dares touch him tonight.

00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:22.834
Just a sheltered woman.

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:23.994
Let me show you

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.674
how ruthless
this sheltered woman's sword is.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:27.555
Don't!

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:30.954
Yuwen Que!

00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:32.074
Listen carefully.

00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:34.674
Your life belongs to me.

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:36.394
Except for me,

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:37.995
no one may take it.

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:51.794
(So you never truly hated me.)

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:58.435
(Cangzhou Prefecture)
The price of betraying me

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:00.353
is death.

00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:01.315
I

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:02.852
have no regrets.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.195
Guards!

00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:05.182
Wait!

00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:08.353
General Su.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.475
You're still alive?

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:15.155
Why are you here?

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:19.753
Hasn't Your Majesty always wanted
the Su Army's support?

00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:22.595
I am willing to pledge loyalty.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.475
What is your condition?

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:28.114
Release her.

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:30.475
General.

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:31.913
Just for her?

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:33.435
Thirty thousand Su Army

00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:34.633
for one life.

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:35.880
What do you think, Your Majesty?

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.555
Take her away to recover.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:44.595
Please.

00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:55.435
Why?

00:03:55.594 --> 00:03:56.794
Because you worth it.

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:07.834
Why did you save me?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.035
You saved my life.

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:11.514
I saved yours.

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:12.954
We're even.

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:26.355
I saved you

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:29.474
to obtain your military seal
for the Emperor of Cangzhou.

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:31.875
I know.

00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:34.115
Long ago, you...

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:36.274
Otherwise, why would I wait until today?

00:04:37.754 --> 00:04:39.714
Do you truly intend
to become a traitor to Mobei?

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:42.555
A traitor?

00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:44.954
Why should they alone possess

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:46.875
the realm won by the Su Army?

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:48.074
My military power

00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:49.594
is mine.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:52.995
General.

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:55.355
If the Yuwen family
could betray the Su family,

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:58.115
why can't I betray the Yuwen family?

00:04:58.194 --> 00:04:59.594
That's not the same thing.

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:02.394
The victor becomes the king,

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:04.355
the defeated becomes a traitor.

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:08.555
I only want to reclaim
what belongs to me.

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:15.514
Take care.

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:23.594
Such vicious intent.

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:26.594
They even poisoned the sword with
Turning Rain Swallow.

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:30.834
Go, now!

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:32.755
Ru!

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:34.355
Go!

00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:35.555
Shut up!

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.154
Lie down.

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:39.115
Didn't I say it already?

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:41.235
Your life is mine.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.474
Go!

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:43.714
Go!

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:45.074
Go!

00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:54.834

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:05.274
Ru.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.034
Don't go.

00:06:08.394 --> 00:06:09.154
Don't go.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:13.315
Do you want me to leave,

00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:14.675
or do you want me to stay?

00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:26.315
Forget it.

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:28.954
I'll consider it a debt I owe you.
I'll repay it someday.

Speak.

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:22.313
The Cangzhou army
has sealed all checkpoints.

00:08:22.314 --> 00:08:24.040
They're searching everywhere
for the Crown Prince.

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.274
I asked you where he is.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:28.633
Someone saw him enter the city wounded,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:30.474
but they couldn't find him.

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:34.020
His wound hasn't healed,
how far could he go?

00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:49.234
It's still warm.

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.999
We can't keep searching.
The people from Cangzhou have already...

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:54.160
How long have you been following us?

00:08:54.754 --> 00:08:55.474
I...

00:08:56.554 --> 00:08:58.457
Since you chose to protect us in secret,

00:08:58.554 --> 00:09:00.074
why didn't you act sooner?

00:09:01.034 --> 00:09:03.195
I dared not disobey
His Majesty's orders.

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:04.232
Of course.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.220
I should've realized earlier.

00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:08.482
You were all waiting,

00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:10.954
waiting to see who would die
by whose hand, weren't you?

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:12.795
I always wanted to see

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:14.754
whether the Crown Prince
truly loved you.

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:15.994
He proved it

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:17.675
by protecting you with his life.

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:21.913
We can't go any further.

00:09:21.914 --> 00:09:22.834
It's too dangerous.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.275
Cui Di.

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:28.354

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:29.795
Last night he had a high fever,

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:32.315
and kept calling my name.

00:09:32.514 --> 00:09:33.275
Young lady.

00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:35.435
I can't let you risk your life.

00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:36.555
This time,

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:38.515
let me find him.

00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:41.635
I still have too many important things
left unfinished.

00:09:43.914 --> 00:09:44.874
Qingru.

00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:46.474
Yuwen Que.

00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:48.994
You'd better not die.

00:09:49.434 --> 00:09:50.555
In this life,

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:53.474
what I hate most is having
my fate controlled by others.

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:55.915
(If Heaven wants me dead,)

00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:57.932
(then let's see)

00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:00.570
(whether fate defies the human heart,)

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.732
(or whether my obsession runs deeper.)

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:30.315
So it really is you.
