Like I said before, it's just for a month,
we'll meet two or three times a week…

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.730
And you just need to
answer whenever I call.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:23.731
Okay.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.367
As long as you do what I ask,
it shouldn't be too difficult.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.784
Got it…

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:36.785
Sir.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.541
Excuse me.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.541
Yes?

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.881
This and this…

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.716
And that one too, please.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.259
Yes, sir.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:03.229
By the way, how long are you
going to keep calling me "sir"?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.232
Hmm…

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.322
Then what should I call you?

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.948
What do lovers usually call each other?

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.409
Hmm…

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:18.869
Honey?

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.454
Ugh…

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:21.955
Babe?

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:22.956
Ugh…

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:27.086
Or since your name is Minwoo…

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.547
How about "MyMin"?

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.549
Are you okay?

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.093
Ba...

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.555
Let's just go with "babe".

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:38.556
Babe.

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:41.142
And when we're alone, call me Mr. Minwoo.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.520
I'll call you Mr. Yooha too.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.605
Yes, babe.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.817
In this kind of situation,
call me "Mr. Minwoo".

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.444
Yes, Mr. Minwoo.

(Chapter 3: Cosmopolitan)

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.952
All of these are for you.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.954
I can't possibly accept this.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.250
I'm giving them to you because you'll
need them, so don't feel pressured.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.752
But I still have so much to pay you back.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.548
This is all included in the contract.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.174
Okay.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.512
Two days later…

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.182
Are you free at 2 PM?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.268
One moment, please.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.354
Yes, I'm free.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.481
Great.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.944
That day, just pretend to be my boyfriend
in front of my friends.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.825
May I ask… what kind of friends?

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.870
Just do what you did with your boyfriend…

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.455
I mean, the bartender yesterday.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.667
- He's not actually my boyfriend-
- Thank you for waiting.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.464
I guess it doesn't matter…

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.553
Minwoo!

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.851
Minwoo.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.938
Shall we go inside and take a look?

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.374
Wow…

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.417
Wow, it's so beautiful.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.962
Hey, Minwoo…

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.129
Have you ever been to places like this?

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.257
Do I look like someone who would?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.926
Minwoo.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.095
Pick one.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.262
Huh?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.309
If we're going to pretend to be a couple,
shouldn't we at least have a matching item?

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.395
Let's pick something for each other.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.022
I'll pay.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:36.275
Okay.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.119
This one.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.955
Oh god, that's so cute!

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.877
How did you know I like cute things?

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.966
And for you, Minwoo…

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:03.344
I'll choose this one.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.975
You want me to wear this?

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.436
Isn't it super cute?

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.063
I think it'll look perfect on you, Minwoo.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.198
Fine…

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.681
Yooha!

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.186
Hello.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.646
Oh, hey.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.106
Come on in, Jaemin.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:02.212
I know you've been busy preparing for jobs
too, so I truly appreciate you helping out.

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.612
Oh, no problem.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.531
I should be thanking you, Taeha.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.662
Oh right, I'll get you an apron.
Change first and I'll explain the work.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.871
Okay.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.637
Oh, that looks good on you.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.072
All set.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.451
Are you feeling okay?

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.662
Huh?

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.664
Oh.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.082
I'm fine.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.838
Your face is beet red.
Do you have a cold or something?

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.842
Ah… is that so?

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.723
I'm okay, though.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.016
Alright.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.018
Then shall I show you around first?

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.019
Please.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.955
- Yes?
- Are you watching?

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.438
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.898
It took me about two hours to get here.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.525
What would you like to drink?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.409
Have you eaten?

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.250
I'm dealing with a wisdom
tooth at the moment.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.123
Ah…

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:06.963
Every time I come here…

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.788
I see you here often,
even though you seem quite busy yourself…

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.331
I'm back.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:44.332
Come one in.

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:48.296
Great job today, everyone.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:53.675
Hey.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.220
How's the job? Is it going okay?

00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:00.391
Yeah, it's fine.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.686
What kind of part-time
job did you do today?

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:10.109
Um… I've taken on a steady
gig as a fake boyfriend.

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.236
For whom?

00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:15.406
Some guy?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:18.199
A guy?

00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:22.705
Hey, don't tell Taeha, okay?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.794
He's not some weird guy, right?

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.673
I don't think he is.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.554
Hey, are you good with
acting cute and stuff?

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.560
Huh? Why are you asking that?

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:49.481
I have to act like I'm really his boyfriend
in front of his friends.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.817
I want to make a strong
impression right away.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:01.827
Ugh…

00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:07.123
Hmph…

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:11.045
Aing~!

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.355
Come one~!

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.380
Hyuuuung~!

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:14.673
Ha!

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.857
Hey… thanks, and sorry too.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:35.569
I'll take care of it from here.

00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:43.785
- Aing~! Come on~!
- Hey, stop it.

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.037
Want me to help~?

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.290
Seriously, you…

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.546
I thought you went abroad.

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:54.675
We left from Jeju and
toured around Europe.

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:56.506
And I was hugging the toilet
all day from the motion sickness.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:12:00.761
Seriously, he practically lived
in the bathroom the whole time.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:11.105
Oh? Hey, Minwoo! Long time no see.
Didn't expect you to show up.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.524
It's so hard to see your face these days.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.110
Who's that next to you? A friend?

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:17.277
Ah…

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.321
He's my boyfriend.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:22.699
Say hi.

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.328
Hello, I'm Son Yooha.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.747
Hello.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.542
- Alright alright, have a seat.
- Hello.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.128
Make yourself comfortable.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:04.033
That looks cute. Where did you buy it?

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:10.080
Huh?

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.915
Hey, Minwoo, what is this?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.000
Did you always like this kind of stuff?

00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.669
Why? It looks good on him…

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.465
Isn't it normal for couples
to have matching items?

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.175
Matching items?

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:22.884
Exactly.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:26.180
Man, I've been so busy lately…

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.682
Preparing for our wedding and all.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.728
But seriously, getting
married… it's no easy business.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:35.855
It's not something a person can do alone.

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:36.941
It's tough work.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.838
Minwoo, shouldn't you get married too?

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.783
Yeah, now is the perfect
time to start thinking about it.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.786
Guys like you staying single these days?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.497
People will give you weird looks, you know?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.791
"Just do what you did with your boyfriend…

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:55.917
I mean…

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.170
With the bartender yesterday"

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:02.549
Of course.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.803
But Minwoo and I are so happy together now.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.263
Minwoo, tell them…

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.849
About how you burned the
onions while cooking yesterday.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.767
- The onions…
- Yeah.

00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:13.394
Ah, right…

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:14.728
The onions…

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:16.522
Wait, are you two living together?

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.315
Cooking?

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.775
Minwoo cooks?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.902
Of course! Minwoo is such a great cook…

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.446
And a great catch, too~

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:27.992
How long has it been since
we've been this lovey-dovey?

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.409
Babe?

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:30.786
- Babe…
- Lovey-dovey?

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.330
So are you two getting married soon?

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:34.789
Marriage?

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.166
We should, someday.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.544
But honestly, we're so
happy even without it.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.964
We're just crazy about
being with each other.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.134
