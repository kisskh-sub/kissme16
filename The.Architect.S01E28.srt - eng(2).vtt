00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.400
Governor, why didn't you tell
Miss Xi Yan the truth?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.039
His Majesty was enraged today.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.990
He was thinking of dispatching her
with his personal guards.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.320
So what even if I do tell her?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.760
She wasn't afraid
of losing her life anyway.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.320
You acted before
His Majesty's personal guards

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.519
in order to protect Miss Xi Yan.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.160
But she misunderstood what you did

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.790
as an attempt to stop her
from overturning the case.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:28.640
Since it has come to this,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.120
the imperial cell

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000
is the only place that can protect her.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:34.840
It's the most dangerous,
yet the safest place for her.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.750
=The Architect=

(May I never disappoint heaven nor you)

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.239
Xi Yan!

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:29.680
Xi Yan!

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.220
We've already checked the surroundings.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.480
There was no sign of a break-in.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.370
I'm afraid the arsonist

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.120
was trying to trap
Miss Xi Yan in the cell

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.200
and silence her.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.280
We've found
all of the bodies in the cell,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.599
except for Miss Xi Yan's.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.530
Governor, I'm afraid
there's more to this than meets the eye.

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:45.599
Xi Yan!

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.879
Governor!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.840
Governor!

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.879
Xi Yan?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480
- Xi Yan!
- Governor!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.599
Governor!

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.159
Let go!

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.439
The fire isn't under control yet!

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.400
It's dangerous inside!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.959
I've already verified the cause!

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.079
Prince Duan visited the cell

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.640
before it caught on fire.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.159
Xiao Huaijin?

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.639
Xiao Huaijin.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.360
Pay with your life.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.560
Pei Yu,

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.800
you'd better open your eyes

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.840
and see closely what's under her.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.719
Xiao Huaijin!

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080
Look closely.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.000
Once the torch in my hand
falls to the ground,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.479
she'll be reduced to ashes immediately.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:47.840
What exactly do you want?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.479
Pei Yu, oh, Pei Yu,

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.639
to think that you'll be at my mercy too.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.120
Listen up.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.680
I hate that conceited look of yours

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.599
the most!

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.520
All of us are merely lackeys
of the emperor.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.280
What gives you the right to belittle me?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.159
Xiao Huaijin,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.400
I'll take her with me
by hook or by crook.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.120
Sure.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.680
Since you like to be a lackey that much,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.199
kneel and beg,

00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:28.080
and I might give you this chance.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.400
So, it turns out that the lusty and
power-hungry Governor Pei,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.159
who's drenched in blood,

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.560
is actually the world's
most romantic man!

I deserve death for my negligence!

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.839
The cell in
the Governor's Residence was on fire.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.990
All of the prisoners
were burned to death.

00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:30.800
It's all because of my negligence.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.360
Your Majesty, please punish me!

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.959
Those prisoners
were on death row anyway.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.319
Forget it.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.000
The preparations for my birthday banquet
haven't been completed yet.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.680
And, it's nearing.

00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:45.959
Xiao,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.920
I will let you take over
the preparations.

00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.510
Your Majesty, thank you for your grace!

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.920
I will surely fulfill my duty!

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.000
The Governor of Huguang offers a pair of

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.337
Persian Xuanwu gold cups as tributes

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.759
while the Governor of Shannan

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.439
presents a jadeite vase
with twin handles as tributes.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:16.762
To celebrate His Majesty's birthday,
the Governor's Residence

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.680
shall present...

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.879
Your Majesty, I've obtained
a priceless treasure

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.120
for your birthday banquet.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.480
With this treasure,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.200
your benevolent rule will bestow
blessings upon the corners of earth,

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:04.000
and the people will hold the court
in greater reverence.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.120
Pei,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.360
that treasure you said, what is it?

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.480
Your Majesty,

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:23.879
this is proof of Prince Duan's
iron ore smuggling

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.360
and

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.519
how he betrayed the state.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.725
Your Majesty.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.399
Insolent commoner!

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.039
I thought you were already
burned to death.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.039
Governor!

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.279
Keep guard beside the cell.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.950
Do not allow anyone
to approach the cell.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.600
Yes, Governor.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.000
What are you up to again?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.810
Just now, I received news
from the palace.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.200
My sister was terminally ill.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.420
And, she summoned me to her palace.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.279
But according to the palace rules,

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.620
even if my sister was terminally ill,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.960
the imperial physicians
should've been summoned first.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.879
After that, the case would be
reported to His Majesty.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.950
Why would they summon
an outsider like me

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.279
to the palace immediately?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.600
What do you mean by that?

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.399
I'm sure

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:41.960
someone is trying to lure me away

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.850
so that they can silence you.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.600
Aren't you the one
who's trying to silence me?

00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:03.475
(Changning, I'm safe now. Pei Yu
has hidden me away and kept me safe.)

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.039
This is Yunqi's handwriting.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.879
Is he fine?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.399
But I saw you stabbing him...

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.639
What you saw was precisely
what I wanted Xiao Huaijin to see.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.039
Back then, I predicted

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.159
that Xiao Huaijin would target you two.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.900
Therefore, I prepared
a blood pack in advance.

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:25.240
(Pei Yu said he wanted to help you)
I kept it near Yunqi's chest.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.187
(I could only reunite with you
after the incident was over.)

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.480
Yunqi would only be safe

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.919
if Xiao Huaijin thought
that he was dead.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.600
So,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.990
was throwing me into the imperial cell

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:38.639
all part of your plan?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.879
That's right.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.600
I did it to deceive Xiao Huaijin

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:45.799
and His Majesty.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.990
You intend to hand over the evidence
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.480
By then, Xiao Huaijin will be convicted

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:53.764
of treason.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.600
He'll surely try to silence you.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.970
Perhaps the cell will be
reduced to cinders

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.399
after my departure.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440
Once it starts burning,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.000
someone will guide you

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.430
and help you escape
through the secret chamber.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.720
Xi Yan.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.639
Please be careful.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.279
Okay.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.840
Pei Yu,

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:30.960
I'll trust you one last time.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.240
It's on fire! We need help!

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:37.559
Help!

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.710
Hurry and put out the fire!

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:41.759
Hurry! Over here!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.799
Save me!

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.679
Xiao Huaijin burned down
the cell in your residence,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.919
yet His Majesty didn't press
any charges against him.

00:13:10.437 --> 00:13:11.478
Fairness,

00:13:12.362 --> 00:13:13.323
justice,

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.519
and everything I've been fighting for...

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.039
To think that all of those actually
depended on the ruler's conscience.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.159
Even if we have concrete evidence,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.470
as long as His Majesty
never nods his head,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.450
no matter how much we try
to overturn the Shen family's massacre,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.519
the case will be put aside,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.279
and it'll yield nothing.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.559
No.

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:38.200
I can't just let that happen.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.799
Whether or not the Shen family's name
can be cleared

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.220
doesn't just involve the Shen family.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.000
It also concerns Shen Shipping

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.500
and its tens of thousands of workers.

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:48.879
Their family members
were implicated by this case.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.399
Many of them lost their livelihood

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:52.679
and had their family shattered.

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:55.890
Everyone is waiting for the day
that their names will be cleared.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.440
If His Majesty doesn't agree to it,

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.639
we'll just make him do it.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:02.600
That's right.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.679
Even if the sky is falling on us,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.840
we'll dig a hole on top of our heads.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.580
If a confidential letter isn't enough,

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:10.919
let's locate concrete evidence

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.480
of Xiao Huaijin's treason.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.639
Now, everyone in the world

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:17.240
thinks that I've been burned to death.

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:18.559
And, Xiao Huaijin

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.919
has let down his guard.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We can use this opportunity

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.559
to follow the leads Li Wan'er
had written in her letter

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:23.879
and seek out the truth.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.159
During His Majesty's birthday banquet,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.990
officials from all provinces will come to
the capital to celebrate his birthday.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:33.360
By then, we can present the evidence
of Xiao Huaijin's corruption to him.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.639
If so, Xiao Huaijin's true colors

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.080
will be revealed to all.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:39.279
Pei Yu,

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.600
has this ever occurred to you?

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:43.759
If we fail,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.600
you'll most definitely be implicated.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.320
You might even be denied
a proper burial after death.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:53.120
I've never known defeat
ever since my days

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.759
in the Arena of Beast.

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.840
In life,

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.240
no matter if it's a cowardly death

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.200
or a heroic death,
one will die eventually.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.759
As long as I think it's worth it,

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:07.639
it doesn't matter even if

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.290
I have to stake my life on it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.159
No matter what,

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:14.519
I didn't squander

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:16.399
the opportunity given to us
by the heavens.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.720
No matter if we succeed or fail,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.080
I'm going to give it a try.

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:25.580
May I never disappoint

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:27.000
Heaven

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.159
nor you.

00:15:49.612 --> 00:15:51.639
(End of Episode)

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.320
You guys are forcing me to do this!

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.559
Tell me!

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.550
Just how much have you all
received from the Shen family?

00:15:57.799 --> 00:15:59.159
To eradicate traitors

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.080
and preserve the peace of the state,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.960
I am willing

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:03.159
to sacrifice myself.

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:04.639
Darned emperor!

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.399
Come out and meet your death!
