When exactly are you leaving
for Changbai Mountain tomorrow?

The flight's at noon.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.280
You're going to Changbai Mountain
with your mom?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.259
You should head out after lunch,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.060
since you have to get your stuff packed.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.460
Right.

It's like minus twenty-something
over there.

Last year, you didn't show up
until Chinese New Year's Day, either.

This is just too much.

The only time I saw him
was when he was a kid.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.020
Yeah, he's a real looker now.

But with the way you ski,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.140
you're basically a scuttling crab.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.300
Professional gear
would be a waste on you anyway.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.600
Jiang Rui, you're dead.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.740
Stop.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.640
Jiang Rui.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.360
You two, take it easy.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.240
It's slippery out here.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.160
Don't go breaking a bone

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.020
before we even hit the slopes.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.420
He said I look like a scuttling crab.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.480
I didn't even mention the fact

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.500
that he's "all gear and no idea."

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.660
What the heck?

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.140
Are you serious?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.400
I just haven't skied for three years
because of high school.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.840
I used to kill it on the slopes.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.500
Just wait till I find my legs.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.900
I'll be tearing up the black runs
in no time.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.380
There's a saying:

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.380
"Bright child, dull adult."

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.080
Maybe now that you're older,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.080
your body has just grown stiff.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.800
Still younger than you, though.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.440
They were so thick as thieves
just yesterday.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.900
A few hours later,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.340
they're already at it again.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.380
That's just how it is when you're close.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.940
Didn't you and Jiang Yun
always spar like that

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.720
when you were kids?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.320
Him?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.240
He never dared to talk back to me.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.880
I shut him down every time.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.400
Sounds like

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.060
Jiang Rui is showing more spine

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.060
than I did.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.220
[Lin]
When I was chatting with my mom,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.600
an idea popped into my head.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.860
What is it?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.420
We still haven't named

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480
the PV garden.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.900
How do you like

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.400
"Liuguang Garden"?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.580
Focus on your conversation.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.140
No shop talk.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.680
Have you arrived
in Changbai Mountain yet?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.080
Who are you chatting with?
You look suspiciously happy.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.860
We literally just had a fight.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400
You're not checking my phone.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.140
Who's fighting?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.360
I even gave you the window seat.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.160
There are
a dozen window seats here, okay?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.780
Move over.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.420
No.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.940
Move.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.480
Not happening.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.980
Oh, my scarf and beanie!

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.540
Ugh, so annoying.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.900
Actually, there's something

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.660
I forgot to tell you.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.220
I learned a huge secret

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.780
while I was home.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.180
But if you're gonna be like that,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:40.980
I'm keeping it to myself.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.700
As if I care.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.200
You sure you don't want to hear it?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.940
It's about you.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.820
Fine, don't come crying to me later,
Nie Xiguang.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.300
Every day you wait

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.160
is a day of happiness
you're missing out on.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.220
We're here. This is the place.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.720
Wow, it looks like something
straight out of a fairy tale.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.580
Come on, hurry.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.340
Thanks.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.860
Our hotel

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.000
is divided into two sections,
the main hotel

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.720
and the villa area.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.060
The villas are incredibly popular
this year

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.000
and were fully booked a long time ago.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.120
The building...

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.340
- where we just checked in
- Watch your step.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.760
is the main hotel.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.000
That's where you'll need to go
for breakfast.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.940
Do we have to walk over there

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.680
every morning?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.280
Of course not. I'll be your shuttle.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.020
Worst case,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.140
I can just bring back some local treats.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.200
- Honestly, just staying in
- Come on.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.500
and having some tea

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.180
would be nice too.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280
I even saw some deer

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.400
on the drive over.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.020
Really?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.800
It's kind of a thing here at this hotel.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.220
You don't even have to
leave the grounds to see them.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.160
Come on.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.120
Thank you.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.740
Watch your step, everyone.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.020
Careful.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.860
Take a photo of me.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.880
Hang on.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.220
You can't even see
who it is in this shot.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.620
Never mind that.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.940
That's the whole point.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.700
See?

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.060
Ugh, so tacky.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.000
[Lin]

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.880
Xiguang, hurry up. It's freezing.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.320
[- Expecting what? - Photos?]
Mystery photo incoming. Check it out.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.240
She actually gave away her location.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.340
Thanks.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.740
What does that mean?

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.360
He's acting so sketchy.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.400
Mrs. Jiang,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.000
let's take a quick breather.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.260
Later, I'll show you guys

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.000
around the resort's shopping street

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.780
and we'll grab some dinner.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.740
Then we can sit down

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.540
and plan out

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.360
the rest of the trip.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.800
We were supposed

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.520
to go to Tianchi Lake tomorrow.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.640
But the main peak is closed

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.480
due to the weather.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.240
We're still waiting for word

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.060
on when it'll reopen.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.320
But the rest of our plans

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:01.860
are still a go.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.300
I'm skipping the tourist spots tomorrow

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.340
and heading straight to the slopes.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:05.860
No, you're going.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:06.940
Wait,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.260
why?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.160
You can't

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.100
force me.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.340
Because I'm the one

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.360
paying for this trip.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.540
Listen up, everyone!

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.720
It's the frozen apocalypse,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.240
and we are on the run!

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.620
The zombies

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.440
are right on our heels!

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.180
Jiang Rui,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.800
what kind of weird novels

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.380
have you been reading lately?

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:52.760
How was it?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.960
I can't do that again.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.340
My heart is about
to jump out of my chest.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.960
I thought you said
you didn't want to come?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.500
You are having more fun than anyone.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.020
I love this.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.380
What do you say? One more time?

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.300
Or the off-roaders are fine too.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.220
Hu!

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.200
What would you like, Madam?

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.380
Could we do something

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.280
less intense?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.380
Not bad, right?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.680
Move a bit this way. Yeah.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.220
Perfect.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.600
Does it look good from here?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.320
It's okay.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.560
Yeah, move over a bit.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.540
Let's get the mountains in the shot.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.340
The one footing the bill
calls the shots.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.260
The one footing the bill
calls the shots.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.940
The one footing the bill is your mom.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.420
Take a picture with me.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.560
Let's get one together.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.480
Oh, come on, Mom.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.880
No.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.320
Forget it.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.900
I'll just take a candid of you.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.380
No, forget it.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.920
Let's call it a day.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.460
Let's head back and recharge.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.200
[Changbai Mountain]
[Powder Snow Valley]

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.819
Let's hit the hot springs after dinner.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.180
I've arranged everything.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:07.480
Count me in.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.200
My face is literally numb.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.760
No, Nie Xiguang.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.760
That's for middle-aged people.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.400
Don't be so lame.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.160
It's only 3 PM.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.099
We're definitely going skiing.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.800
Forget the hot springs.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.240
We have to stay
until the night session is over.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.560
Just go by yourself.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.000
I haven't even bought any gear yet.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.880
Let's go pick some out.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.520
Jiang Rui!

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.060
Don't run off.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.480
You're covering half, right?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.940
I got it.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.900
Quit harping on it.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.780
This is why you should've packed

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.520
your own gear.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.320
The selection here is meh.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.340
I'll buy the outfit and pads,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.520
and I'm renting the board.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.240
Lugging it around is a pain.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.740
You are pathetically lazy.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.940
What?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.820
I don't even know

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.080
what board fits me.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.600
It's been forever

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.440
since I last skied.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.760
Renting is just smarter.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.820
Let's go.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.280
[Vector]

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.340
Welcome.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.620
Please, feel free to look around.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.900
We have snowboards, skis,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.700
and all the gear you'll need.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.140
Great.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:02.700
She's a skier.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.780
We need a full set of gear,

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.380
everything except the skis.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.820
Got it.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.520
So cute.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:07.900
Jiang Rui.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.940
What are you doing here?

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.040
What are you doing here?

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.520
You look good in anything.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.060
Do you have this in my size?

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.540
Yes, we do.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.480
What about those boots?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.800
Are they good for beginners?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.140
With the flex on these,

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.480
they're perfect for beginners.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.640
What's your size?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.640
EU 37.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.160
Okay.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.540
Just a moment.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.320
Thanks.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.520
Rental clothes all look the same anyway.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.300
If you didn't bring anything,

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.440
you should just buy a set at the store.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.060
I brought

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.000
my full setup.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.280
I brought mine too,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.760
but I want to switch it up.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.460
I need some advice.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.380
Zhuang and I are total noobs.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.040
We don't know jack.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.520
Xu?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.080
Zhuang,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.340
is he a friend of yours?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.600
Yeah.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.220
He's a student I used to tutor.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.660
You're here skiing, too?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.020
Yeah, just on vacation.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.560
We're here for a team-building trip.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.520
What a coincidence.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.480
I'm just here helping my cousin
pick out some gear.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.360
Miss,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.040
I've got your clothes ready.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.960
You can try these on right over here.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.540
I'll get you fitted for boots
once you're done with the clothes.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:55.800
Okay.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.040
Alright, let's try some on, too.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.260
Right this way, please.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.540
This one's good.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.980
Zhuang.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.580
Are you going to learn
snowboarding or skiing?

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.000
I'd recommend snowboarding.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.300
Guys look so cool doing it.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.600
I can give it a try.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.300
Yeah, try it out.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.640
No need to buy

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.980
a board and boots just yet.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.120
Just get a face mask,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.280
some snow clothes,
and you're good to go.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.500
This one looks pretty good.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.900
Try it on.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.400
How come

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.560
Xu is here at Changbai Mountain, too?

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.940
Could it be that Zhuang Fei

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.680
saw my messages

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.620
in the group chat

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.380
and tipped him off?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.400
No.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.220
He said it was a team-building trip,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:03.680
but still...

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.140
Come in.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.100
Here.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.120
I've wiped

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.060
and dried your boots.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:12.720
Thanks.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.320
By the way, Ms. Zhang,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.140
I won't be home

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.020
for lunch tomorrow.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.940
I'm hanging out
with two high school friends.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.980
Wait, it just hit me.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.500
Your friend's brother,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.440
Mr. Zhuang,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.820
who used to tutor you.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:27.920
He came by

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.740
looking for you

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.040
while you and Xiguang
were studying abroad.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.720
Xu?

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.140
What was he looking for?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.200
No idea.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.320
It was bucketing down that day.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.520
I told him you were overseas studying,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.780
and he just took off.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360
Did he try calling you after?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.160
Nope.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.400
Maybe the time difference
messed things up and I missed it.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.780
And Ms. Zhang,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.080
we were on a study trip,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.880
not studying abroad.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.160
Why do you always get that mixed up?

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.520
I can't keep all that straight.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.160
I'll do it myself.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.340
Done.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:01.980
Xiguang,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.780
how do you like it?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.160
Does it fit?

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.080
It's great.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.220
I'll take the pink one.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.360
Okay, I'll bag that up for you.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.160
Okay. Thanks.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.340
Let's go try on the boots now.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.820
This way, please.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.120
Gee, these ski boots

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.200
are total bricks.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.040
You're gonna be walking

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.960
like a robot tomorrow.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.640
Don't jinx me

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.820
before we even hit the slopes.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.180
My bad.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.740
These are actually pretty standard

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.800
for beginners.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.140
If they're too soft or light,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.200
you won't be able
to drive the skis properly.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.140
Excuse me.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.540
Could you help us get these clothes

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.560
in their sizes?

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.320
Just a moment.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.400
I'm helping her with her boots.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.660
I'm the only one in the shop today.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.440
Sorry about the wait.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.160
Go ahead.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.980
I can try these on myself.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.100
No worries, we can wait.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.100
Thank you.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.620
These feel pretty good.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.300
I'll take these.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.140
We've also picked out some other things.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.000
Let's check them all out together.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.560
Sure thing.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.880
Thank you.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.580
Xiguang, let me take those.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.720
You can take this one.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.060
Xu,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.700
we're heading out now.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.100
See you around.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.380
Take care. Come back soon.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.800
See which one you like.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.260
The detail on this one is different,

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.220
right?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:38.940
If you really don't

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.320
feel like skiing,

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:40.760
we could go

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.800
to the hot springs instead.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.680
Why wouldn't we go?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.080
We've already bought everything.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.460
We'll go to the ski center,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.140
drop off our gear, rent the boards,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:51.980
and then head back for dinner.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.320
After that, we'll hit the slopes.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.480
I'm just afraid you're distracted

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.760
and might end up having an accident.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.000
And besides,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.160
they might be out there skiing, too.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.200
Don't worry about it.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.180
It's been so long.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.200
We're going.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.300
Are you sure?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.780
You weren't even looking
where you were going just now.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.540
I was just wondering

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.160
why I didn't see

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.200
that roommate.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:21.920
Never mind.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.000
It's none of my business anymore.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.140
Jiang Rui,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.040
didn't you say yesterday

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.140
that you had a secret to tell me?

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.740
Change of plans.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.700
I'm holding off for now.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.660
I need to see how things go first.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.800
You don't actually have it, do you?

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.580
You're just making it up.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.720
I really do.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.620
Then let's hear it.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.680

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.460
I've got nothing to hide.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.280
What dirt?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.060
Seriously?

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.800
Last time

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.120
at the karaoke bar,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:46.780
he got wasted

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.480
and told me everything.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.160
And I recorded the whole thing.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:51.960
Come on, cheers.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.320
Seriously, Kevin,

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.140
I think Zhuang has a better shot

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.320
at debuting than you do.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.880
We're in different leagues.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.880
He's an idol,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:00.860
but I'm a vocal legend.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:02.680
But hey, Zhuang Xu,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.020
what if we start a duo?

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:04.760
What should we call it?

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:10.280
The Huaya Duo.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.300
Oh, brilliant.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.300
Just hearing that name...

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.100
completely killed my vibe.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.000
I don't even want to debut anymore.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.980
The Huaya Duo.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.320
Drinking straight is no fun.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.260
Let's

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.719
spice things up with a game.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.360
- Sure.
- I'm in.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.679
Standard cards or Texas Hold'em?

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.340
Truth or Dare.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.639
I need to get some dirt
on you guys, too.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.080
That game is so played out.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.520
Yeah, seriously.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.380
We even know how many times

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.280
you've been rejected

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.219
since you were a kid.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.000
But we've got

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.620
someone new to play with today.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:45.340
So, you're coming for me.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.500
How do you know

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.300
it'll even land on me?

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.600
There's always a chance.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.040
Anyway, you guys have already dug up
all my secrets.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.020
I've got nothing left to fear.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.179
Alright, let's do it.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:53.840
Start it up.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.500
Come on.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.520
Let's get started.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.980
No need to explain the rules, right?

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.720
We're playing the mild version.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.460
If you don't want to answer
or do the dare,

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.520
you just take a shot.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.240
Okay.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.660
Alright.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.300
I'm the first one? Seriously?

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.080
Okay, I choose Truth. Shoot.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.440
How many exes do you have?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.100
Two.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.040
Your questions are so lame.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.700
I agree.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:23.820
My turn to spin the bottle.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.560
Truth.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.240
Make it a hard one.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.700
How many people have you dated?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.080
Oh, so now the question
isn't lame anymore?

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.880
Yup!

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:47.760
None.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:51.960
No way, I don't buy it.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.380
Why?

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.480
That's another question.
Save it for next time.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.780
Spin it.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.840
Quick.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:01.600
Come on.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.980
Yeah.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.680
Wait, how does this work?

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.660
Do I ask myself?

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.980
No, I still get to ask.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.600
Let's see.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.380
Why?

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.320
Is it because you got rejected

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:20.980
like Kevin?

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.960
Hold on, isn't that two questions?

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.580
Wow, you're such a cheapskate.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.060
Okay, let me change it.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.040
Is there someone you like?

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320
I can choose to drink instead, right?

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.740
Now you're being no fun.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:56.920
Yeah.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.820
Zhuang.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.660
Look at him.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.740
He's totally wasted.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.520
They were even trying
to outdrink each other.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.680
Who's the bigger lightweight, seriously?

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.800
It's freezing.
What are you doing out here?

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.220
I've had too much.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.560
It's so stuffy in there.
I was starting to feel dizzy.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:54.840
Isn't that your student

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.660
and his cousin?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.140
So they're staying at this hotel too.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.820
Probably in the villa area.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.380
It's beautiful over there.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.700
Too bad they were all booked up

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.360
when we tried to reserve.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.000
This place is nice too.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:07.740
More convenient.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.920
To be honest,
I felt a bit awkward today.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:22.760
Why?

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.760
When we were at the slopes,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.120
I thought

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.720
you weren't close
with your student's cousin.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.940
So I asked her

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.040
to take a photo of us.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.020
But seeing the two of you later,

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.000
I get the feeling

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.400
you two have a history.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.440
I don't think

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.280
I've even spoken to her.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.420
Call it a woman's intuition.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.960
And besides, staying at this hotel

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.580
was your idea, wasn't it?

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.700
Did you know

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.480
they were staying here

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.380
and planned all this?

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.120
My brother

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.500
planned the trip.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.880
I told you guys about it.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.240
But then he caught a stomach bug,
so he couldn't make it.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.560
I see.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.700
But why have you been drinking like that

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.680
ever since you got back?

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.000
I can tell

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.400
you've been putting on a brave face,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.920
even though you were

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.940
laughing and chatting along.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.740
So you do have a history.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.900
If you really like her,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.480
just go for it.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.920
What's the point of drinking alone
like this?

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.540
If I were you,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.280
I'd just ask her out.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.300
No.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.240
When they walked past us just now,

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:37.700
I should have

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.320
just shouted out to them.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.920
It's not what you think.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.220
There's no history between us.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.760
And

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.440
if memory serves,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.640
she has a boyfriend.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.680
Hey, Xu.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.480
Is your stomach bug better?

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.780
It's better.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.960
I went to Aunt's for dinner

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.000
with Mom today.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.080
I'm completely fine now.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.620
The timing couldn't have been worse,

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.380
making me miss out on Changbai Mountain.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.820
You can always go some other time.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.220
It's not like it's far.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.580
My colleagues chose Changbai Mountain

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.500
because of me.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.520
That's why I had to show up.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.300
I know.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.220
Xu,

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.140
are you having

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:27.880
a good time there?

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.020
Did you come across

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.840
anything interesting?

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.180
What could I possibly come across?

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.840
You know, just something fun,

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.560
or someone.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.300
Zhuang Fei.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.800
Did you know Jiang Rui

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.660
was coming to Changbai Mountain?

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:57.580
Xu,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.740
I...

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.540
I just think

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.340
you should give yourself a chance.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.680
Back in Shanghai,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.300
that time you got drunk and...

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.820
Don't ever do something like this again.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.200
I understand.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:13.740
But

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.600
you've told me since we were kids

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.200
that if you want something,
you have to fight for it.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.460
Fight for it?

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:26.940
How?

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.800
She already has a boyfriend.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.040
So how am I supposed to fight for her?

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.740
Am I supposed to

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:45.980
steal her away?
