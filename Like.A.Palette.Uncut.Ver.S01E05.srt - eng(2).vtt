00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.760
Honey...

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.251
don't get angry at our child.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960
I'm sorry I was born like this,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.800
that I was born as a boy.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.400
But I really can't fight the feelings
of wanting to be a girl.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.760
Jasmine's photo
that a neighbor tattled on

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.160
really made Dad fume.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.760
After that day, he refused
to talk to Jasmine for about a year.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.120
But for me,
Jasmine's story was the reason

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.720
I had the courage to become someone

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.360
who is self-assured

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.080
and not afraid to confront anything.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080
I am her health education teacher.

00:02:45.372 --> 00:02:47.960
My apologies on behalf of Jarin.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.920
But I didn't do anything wrong.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.760
She's even denying her wrongdoing
in front of her mom.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.240
Do you see how this child is now?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.280
You're in the wrong, Miss.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.960
If anything, you owe my mom an apology.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.080
Jane!

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.520
What happened, ma'am?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.080
Jarin insulted her teacher
in front of her classmates.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.680
What kind of language did she use?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Jarin said that if the teacher
removed her womb,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.640
she wouldn't be a woman.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.080
Uh...

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520
And what made my daughter say it?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.920
There must be
a reason for that, ma'am.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.680
I was teaching her about genders.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.360
I merely said that,
apart from male and female,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.280
there's a group of people
with gender confusion.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.640
After that, she started insulting me.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.209
You left something out.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800
You gave an example

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.600
that people with gender confusion
would be like my sister.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.280
Isn't that the truth?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.240
He's grown up
and still confused about his gender.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.120
What kind of woman goes by "Mister,"

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.560
and without a womb at that?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.280
That's why I asked:

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.280
if your womb were removed,
would you consider yourself a woman?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.400
See?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.040
This child is beyond control.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.200
I suggest you expel her.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.880
Though my child couldn't choose
the body she was born into,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.280
she still has every right
to choose how she lives her life.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.640
Her decision to transition
is not gender confusion,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.080
but the courage to accept who she is.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.920
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.360
Fermented fish!

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.082
I heard you like it.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.400
Is Dai really this irresistible?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.080
Elf,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.880
I'm writing a sapphic comic!

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.360
My friend here
is reaching for the star.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.600
And Dai is such a rare one.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.840
Is my friend
really gonna date the campus queen?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.120
Girl, that's so freaking cool!

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.480
I'm just...

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.398
trying to give her a chance.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.360
"Give her a chance"?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.040
I think it's the other way around.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.200
Facts.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.233
What's there to think?

00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:09.240
If it were me, I'd totally go all out.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.680
It just happens that I'm into boys,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.800
not girls.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.520
The reason I'm still unsure
is that Dai is a girl.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.880
If Dad finds out,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.000
he's definitely gonna go off on me.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.000
Why should it matter
if boys like boys or girls like girls?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.240
Love is such a beautiful thing.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.040
It's 2025, and seeing as how progressive
the world has become,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.393
why discriminate
based on sexual orientation?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.480
Hm, Waii?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.011
Huh?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.600
You seem pretty invested.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.680
I'm not.
I'm just giving her the encouragement.

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:51.600
Right...

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.040
Mm, why?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.920
Mm.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.920
Hey...

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.720
Dai just followed me.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.800
Should I accept her request?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.720
- Duh!
- Duh!

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.920
Mm.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.200
Look at that silly grin.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.360
Hm?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.000
- What's the matter with you?
- Hm?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040
Nothing.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.461
What?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.800
Maybe you wanna grab the cup?

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.160
- Yeah!
- What are you even sucking on?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.320
Here!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.280
What are you even doing?

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.560
- Homegirl is getting awkward.
- Mm.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.080
Whoa!

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.334
Why are you stalking me, Pang?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.120
Well, you're hiding
something from me, NewYear.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560
Hiding what?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.320
Yesterday,
you didn't pick up any of my calls

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.600
and even left me on read.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.640
Oh...

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.400
They didn't allow phones
in the theater,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.400
don't you know that?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.280
Huh? "Theater"?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.920
Who were you with?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.360
Why do you need to know?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.240
Don't tell me
you were with another boy.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.560
I wasn't!

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:13.754
I went there with Waii.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.520
Well, Cake's friend
we met at the coffee shop the other day.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080
Oh...

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.000
Yes, Waii?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.240
Today?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.720
That works.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.000
Then, I'll wait for you
at the usual spot.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.600
Hello?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.520
I'm in a library.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.000
Can I call you back?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.600
This... This is urgent.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.840
Just a quick word.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.440
Okay, then.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.600
JaneWill, take your call outside.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.720
This is a library,
so there's a noise policy.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880
She's right! Go!

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640
What's going on?

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.800
Me?

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.520
Why? Why me?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.960
Kids these days...

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.640
They got so entitled
after gaining some followers!

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.480
Not just "some," though.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.760
Jane's fans are over 600,000, Elf!

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.960
So what?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.560
Does she think
the world revolves around her?

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.040
If I weren't so busy,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.440
I would've drawn it myself!

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.760
That sounds good!

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.160
That way, we can save the cost!

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.973
I was being sarcastic!!

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.640
I don't know how to draw!

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.240
I graduated
from the Automotive Program!

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.400
What nonsense!

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.800
Go make me some coffee!

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.840
And make it sweet.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.320
My body needs a rush of sugar.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.240
I'm pissed!!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.560
Did you get into a fight?

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.920
Mm.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.800
Well,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.920
it was ToonDenie's editor.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680
What?

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.040
Why would you beef with her?

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.280
Do you wanna be jobless?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.240
Well, she's very controlling toward me.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.320
She told me
the genre I pitched her wasn't okay

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.960
after I told her
I wanna write a sapphic comic.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.120
She said GL's genre

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.720
wouldn't perform as well as
the BL and the straight ones

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.000
and that it wasn't for the market.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.520
And who was she to judge that it wasn't?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.640
Mm.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.120
I don't like being forced,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.080
so I told her that

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.960
if she didn't approve it,
I'd publish my work on another platform.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.960
Whoa, you're the GOAT!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.240
Show 'em how it's done!

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.400
And that's how she agreed, right?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.360
No, that's how she dropped me.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.920
It's a good thing, though.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.560
Now, I don't have to stress out
about the deadline anymore.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.560
Plus, I get my freedom this way.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.120
I can write whatever I want now.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320
- Mm.
- Mm!

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.547
True that.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.520
Then, how do you know
the sapphic genre is gonna work?

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.560
You bet it's gonna!

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.440
Right, JaneWill?

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.760
Mm, I'm confident.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.320
I'm a bit psychic.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.320
I have a feeling it's gonna blow up.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.160
I have a fifth sense.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.400
Mm...

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.439
I think it's more
because you're lovesick, JaneWill.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.720
Mm.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960
What took you so long?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.520
I was finishing a report,
so it took me a while.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.160
And what did they assign us to do?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.560
Professor Erika and Guichai
told us to practice on our walk.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.880
Dear and I had already finished ours.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.160
Since you just got here,
hurry along to the professor.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.320
Whoa...

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.160
this is not right up my alley at all.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.240
I can do the duck walk, though.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.520
You're a hoot and a half, JaneWill.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.600
You done decided
on your talent segment?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.160
I don't know.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.600
What did people do last year?

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.960
Ask last year's campus queen.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.000
Dai showcased
her black-belt karate skill,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.840
with a lil' strummin' on a guitar.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.400
There she is.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.720

Who's the girl next to Dai?

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.740
Isn't she the Queen of Pharmacy?

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.320
That's right, she's Ging,

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.560

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.000

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.920
- Hello, Kaning.
- Hi.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.960
Hm, so...

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.580
is there something going on?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Nothing.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
You sure?

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.010
You can tell me
if you need our help.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840
Thank you.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.440
Okay, I'm off.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.840

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.320
Sup!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.720
Have you eaten?

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.440
What's up with you?!

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.720
Nothing, I'm fine.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.560
Guys,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.610
I'm really starting to dislike someone.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.120
Who? Spill.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.320
Getting nosy.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.200
The Queen of Pharmacy.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.040
I don't like the Queen of Pharmacy.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.880
What did that beyotch do to you?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.000
She was cozying up to Dai!

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.960
Eek!

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.720
Who TF dares take away
the campus queen from my gurl?

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.040
GTFO.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.200
Gotta handle that chick.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.640
Tomorrow is the dress rehearsal.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.760

We gotta lay low, right?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.200
Hell to the nah!

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.040
I'm tired of deciphering Cake's lingo.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.400
Language teachers
would totally throw hands.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.480
We'll talk again
at the faculty building.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.800
Betcha. Toodles.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.960
Cake,

how could your friend do that to me?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.600
Who?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.720
What? How?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840
It's Waii.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.080
She's messing with my girlfriend.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.440
Your girlfriend...

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.710
Who?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.960
The one who tutored me
at the coffee shop.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.940
Oh, didn't you say
you were in the talking stage?

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.120
Alright, alright, we are just that.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.840
I don't even know
how she got her freaking number.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.290
They even went to a movie together.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.120
Can you tell her
to leave NewYear alone?

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.400
It's probably not what you think.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.640
Maybe it's someone with the same name.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.560
And if it was really Waii,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.280
why would she mix with that kid?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.480
If you don't believe me,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.440
I'll get you proof.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.120
Mm, go on.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.440
Pretty please, Dai?

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.320
Hm...

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.360
If I refused, you'd get mad
at me like always, right?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.280
It's not a big deal.
You can just say yes.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040
Please?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.000

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.520
Why in tarnation are ya just standin'?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.600
Ain't your stomach touchin' your back?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.440

when I'm just standing straight?

Well, I'll be!
That's not what I meant.

Huh? What was that?

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960
Look.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.570

Quick, or none will be left.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.320
No...

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.400
- You can go ahead.
- You haven't given me the answer.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.359
- I'm picking a fight.
- Hurry up and get the first one,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.670
and I'll answer it.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.950
I'll treat you to a drink, too, okay?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.960

- Promise me.

Who are you texting?

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.160
Why do you need to know?

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.360
I'm just asking.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.920
Wanna go to the coffee shop
in front of the university?

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.400
I'm busy.
I have an appointment.

You are?

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.040
You've been acting strange lately, Waii.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.360
Be for real with me.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.080
Where were you yesterday?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.000
You went to a movie, didn't you?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.880

Hey, Ging.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.240
You seem to have a sour face.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.920

Let's add some sweetness.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.720

Nothing.

I am!

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.920
Did you drop a diamond in your lunch?

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.000
You're digging pretty deep.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.280
Well,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.400
I got it.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.280
Why did you say it with that voice?

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.720
What did they put in that chicken?

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.920
She is your type, isn't she?

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.760
Huh?

What do you mean?

Dumb, don't play Dai.

You know what I mean.
Don't play dumb, Dai.

Mm-hm?

I saw

how you guys held hands
and whispered sweet nothings.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.680
You even seemed into it.

So what do you want?

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.160
Are you even
gonna knock on my door anymore,

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.520
or are you gonna do it
on every single queen's?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.680
Are you talking about Ging?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.200
So you know who I'm talking about.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.720

Dai, were you laughing at me?

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.640
Do you take pleasure in teasing me?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.040
You must be having a blast, huh?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.400
Or maybe you see me as a toy?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.440
Ging is my sister.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.640
Fleeing to the restroom?

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.240
I didn't flee from anything.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.280
From our conversation about Ging.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.280
You really misunderstood me there.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.960
Were you jealous?

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.560
Honey, is the food ready?

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.880
I'm hungry!

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.880
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Dad.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.120
Hi, Ju.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.780
Ooh!

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.060
- You came just in time for food!
- Hi, Mom.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.360
Lots of kisses for you two,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.520
- but never for me.
- Aw, here you go.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.520
Refreshing, isn't it?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.880
So where's Jim?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.040
He went back
to the condo with Mild.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.240
They just made up.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.080
What?!

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.800
Didn't he say they were gonna break up
for real this time?

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.800
But I think it's a good thing
they made up, sweetie.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.560
For the sake of a strong relationship,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.400
- people need to face challenges.
- Mm.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440
If something can be forgiven,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.890
- you should forgive it, right?
- Mm.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.120
Well, I wasn't gonna say
something bad about him.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.800
It's just funny,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.480
considering what a big talker he was.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.600
Am I right, Ju?

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.280
Girl, you're so caught up
in other people's business.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.000
Well, what about that girl?

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040
Hi, Juss.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.360
Where are you guys now?

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.120
- Hey!
- Huh?!

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.760
That girl?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.880
Which one, sweetie?

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.080
What girl?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.280
- Uh...
- Huh?!

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.760
There are no girls.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.440
Ju doesn't know
what he's talking about.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.160
- Uh, wait!
- Mom, I'm hungry!

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.600
I'll help them serve the food.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.160
- Uh, Mom?
- Wait...

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.080
"That girl..."

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.880
Jelly,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.600
do you know anything about this?

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.240
Jelly!

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.930
You miss your Jane, don't you?

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.320
Are you tired
of being with Ju and Juss?

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.600
They're no fun, huh?

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.400
How's your college life?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.840
Everything falling into place?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.920
Yes,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.320
well...

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.640
I'm pretty caught up in the contest,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.520
but after this is over,
I think it'll be better.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.120
Right...

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.600
Ow, Jelly, sit properly.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.520
I can see worry in your eyes.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.440
Juss, you read me as good as Ju.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.360
Well, I'm your older sister.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.080
How could I call myself that
if I couldn't see through you?

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.600
So...

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.760
are you still thinking about
that sophomore girl?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.920
What was her name again?

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240
It's Dai.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.440
Yesterday,
I accidentally did something bad.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.840
To Dai?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.880
Well, not exactly.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.320
I noticed that
the Queen of Pharmacy was close to Dai,

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.960
holding hands
and being all intimate with her,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.560
so I picked a fight with that queen.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.040
After that, I found out

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.480
that she was Dai's sister.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.880
Why didn't you
make sure of it beforehand?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.520
You were being impatient again, huh?

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.440
Well, I didn't know!

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.840
They have different last names.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.240
Who would have thought
she was Dai's half-sister?

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.080
Just your luck.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.180
So what's next?

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.120
How big of a fit did you throw?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.360
I think...

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.400
we need Junior's help with this.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.240
[I'm sorry, Ging]

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.520
Why don't you go take a shower?

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.120
She's gonna reply when she wants to.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.480
Staring at it doesn't help, Jane.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.920
I don't think this will work, Ju.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.600
Is there another way?

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.400
If she doesn't read
or reply to your message,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.200
then there's only one way.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.180
What is it?!

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.640
Apologize to her in person,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.600
but that's not how you do things.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.360
You don't normally
beg for forgiveness, anyway.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.040
I can do it if I have to.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.240
Seems like
she's really into this girl.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.560
I thought so.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320
Poor Jane.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.560
Being a woman,
you must tend to your facial skin.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.480
Don't let it dry out

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.400
like a sun-dried fish!

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.840
Sure, ma'am.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.880
Let's see how your makeup is looking.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.760
How else would it look?

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.600
Given my skills,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.640
I can even turn a corpse

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.600
into an angel.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.340
Of course,
I trust they're in good hands.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.880
Oh, my, I ran out
of this lipstick color.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.680
Erika, do you happen
to have one lying around?

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.320
You came to the right person.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.400
Give that to me.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.200
When it comes to lipstick,
I have all the shades under the sky.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.520
Follow me.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.880
Pick whichever you like, Guichai.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.160
Here, does this work?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160
Ging, so...

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120
Oh my.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.600
How fabulous of Erika.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.640
Right, come on.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.480
There you go.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.960
Thank you, ma'am.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.640
I'm done, too, right?

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.400
Miss, you were done long ago.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.560
Why are you still here?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.430
What?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.440
Alright, since you are already here,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.160
let me take a look
at your makeup again.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:35.850
Come on.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.700
Now, Miss.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.840
Alright.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.520
My gratitude to you.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.760
That was a glorious answer.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.520
Minnie, Ging, Jane,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560
you can now go on stage.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.560
Go on.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.320
If you're wondering
which faculty the next three are from,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.080
let's have the first girl
introduce herself.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.170
I'm...sorry that I misunderstood you.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.880
What did you
misunderstand exactly, JaneWill?

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.080
Are you talking
about my relationship with Dai?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.040
We've been close since we were little,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.240
and I love being clingy to her.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.600
Anyway, I'm sorry
for causing the misunderstanding.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.560
Next up, Miss Khemmika Arunajanjam,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.360
from the Faculty of Pharmacy.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.800
Though,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.080
JaneWill, I don't think
someone like you is right for Dai.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.520
I think Dai
deserves someone prettier

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.080
and smarter.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.920
Stay away from her.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.280
Hello!

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.800
I'm Ging, Khemmika Arunajanjam

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.480
from the Faculty of Pharmacy.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.720
I'm so grateful to be able to...

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.880
Quick, let's get inside.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.120
I told you to buy less food!

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.600
You act like this is a movie theater.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.400
- Don't eat it if you're this fussy.
- Hey, those are still empty.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.400
- Get in.
- Quick.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.360
Please give me lots of love

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.680
and support, everyone.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.280
JaneWill, go slay!

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.560
Waii, sit the hell down!

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.800
- Why?
- Come on, everyone's staring!

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240
We're sorry.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.850
Just eat.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.200
Look, there are two of Jane's fans.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.240
Make that three.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.200
I'm also in.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.800
How do you think your protege will do?

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.320
I always believe she can do it.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760
You're confident, too!

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840
Here goes nothing!

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.360
Let's cheer for her like never before.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.500
Come on, let's go.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.600
Call your sister, Junior.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.840
I think Jane's busy.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.160
She's gonna call you back
when she's done with her thing.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.120
I wonder
how the placements will go,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.120
or if she's gonna become
the campus queen!

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.990
So, in other words, you're just crazy
about your daughter?

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.920
Don't you tease me like that!

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.960
Goodness,

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.000
maybe they have a live broadcast?

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.720
Let's turn the TV on.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.690
Mom, it's the campus
king and queen competition,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.960
not Miss Universe.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.800
I think you should
calm down and be patient.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.240
She's gonna tell you
when she's done with it.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.200
I'm gonna pray to the deities

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.840
as another way to help her.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120
I'd better get going.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.320
And this is the talent segment
by the Queen of Fine and Applied Arts,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.600
Miss Jarin Tiansawangwarp.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.960
Now, for the question,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.920
I'd like to ask you

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.400
if you were to become
the campus queen,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.540
how would you utilize the Internet
to benefit the world?

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.040
Jarin...

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.000
Answer the question.
Why are you just frozen there?

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.480
You're gonna put everyone
to sleep once again.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.080
Please.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.240
I will use it
for the online Loy Krathong festival!

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.720
What do you mean?

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.280
How are we gonna do that?

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.190
Well, I think
that if we float the krathong online,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.040
it will help save the planet
and the environment

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.280
by reducing
disposal in the rivers.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.600
I think this is
the best approach to it.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040
I don't think she's the one.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120
Right.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.640
That's amazing,
the online Loy Krathong festival

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.040
for less pollution and all that.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.960
There's that, I guess.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.680
Alright, now that
we have announced our campus king,

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:30.400
it's time for this year's
Wonder University campus queen!

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.790
She's perfect.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.100
Dear judges, if you're ready,

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.800
pass up your scoring to the stage.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.760
Please.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.120
I must mention that,
aside from the judges' scores,

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.840
votes from all our students also count.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.040
Thank you.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.200
Wow!

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.080
How thrilling!

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.400
Here goes...

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.640
Are you ready?

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.200
If so,

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.920
I would like to announce that

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.400
this year's
Wonder University's campus queen is...

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.960
Miss Panisara Khanom

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.840
from the Faculty of Architecture!

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.400
Congratulations!

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.880
Please come up front.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.080
Come up front.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.000
Alright.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.160
Oh, my, I'm so proud of them.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.600
Our students are such beauties.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.880
Now, the title is being passed over

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.040
from last year's campus queen
to this year's.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.760
Congratulations, sweetie.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.560
Alright, let's give her
another round of applause!

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.680
This is truly amazing!

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.040
It's alright, Jane.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.440
I'll always root for you.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.320
Thank you.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.960
Please leave a message after the beep.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.360
Ju, where are you?

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.560
Hello, Cake! Can you...

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.640
Jane, I'm fighting with my cat.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.680
I'm hanging up.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.680
What?

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.400
Hello, Waii?

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.640
- Are you free to talk?
- What's up?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.960
I'm looking for an outfit,

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.840
but I still don't know what to wear.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.240
Like, should it be
simple or flamboyant,

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.640
a pair of pants or a skirt,

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.070
long or short-sleeved,

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.080
a T-shirt or a shirt...

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.920
Girl, stop.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.560
Just tell me briefly
where you're going.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.100
So...

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.160
Dai asked me out for dinner tonight.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.760
Oh, so it's a date.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.240
Okay, I got it.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.360
Wear your best outfit

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.880
and go all out, alright?

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.560
Like what?

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.560
A love-haze fit.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.320
What is it?

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.680
Gosh, why is it
so hard for you to get it?

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.400
Just wear something that Dai
won't be able to take her eyes off.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.200
And when you're alone, try to be cute.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.120
Less talk, more smile.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.240
And when she looks into your eyes,
you gotta act a little shy

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.960
to get her excited
by how innocent you are.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.920
Got it?

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.160
Mm, I got it.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.560
And take some videos for me, too.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.280
- I wanna see it.
- Mm.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.000
I'm hanging up.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.800
Why are you staring at me, Dai?

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.800
Do you have to go that hard
on your outfit?

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.560
Don't you like it?

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.280
- I'll go change.
- Hey!

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.490
Yes, I do like it.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040
It's adorable.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.480
Looks really good on you.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880
Let's hop on the motorbike.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760
Are you sure?

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.020
Mm!

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:22.160
♫Never thought
the world'd bring you close♫

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:30.280
♫Never knew I'd be the one
daydreaming the most♫

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.560
♫Don't know when it all began,♫

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.360
♫Suddenly, I can't get you off my mind♫

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:44.600
♫Guess you are the sweetest kind♫

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:52.120
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.400
♫There's a warmth
in me that has increased♫

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.360
♫You're the one coloring my sky♫

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:08.120
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.270

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.120
Ooh, so you're all
about glamour now, JaneWill?

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.000
All of a sudden, you got into makeup.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.800
It's not about glamour.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.440
I bet she's in a relationship now.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.160
Why do you have
to be involved with my sister?

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.320
What's going on, JaneWill?

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.520
Out of all the girls in the world,

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.080
why mess with your brother's girl?

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.560
Why don't you pick up my calls
around this d*mn woman?

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.600
Hey, watch your mouth.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.880
Is Waii really a lesbian?

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.600
Stop sticking your nose
into others' business.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.440
What?!

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.480
Knock it off!

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.360
I was coming to find you.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.760
What is it, Champ?
