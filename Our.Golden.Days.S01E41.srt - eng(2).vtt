00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:06.269
What's she doing here?

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.009
(Episode 41)

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.209
You think I'm a joke because I keep letting you off the hook?

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.849
How dare you show up at my mom's restaurant?

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.749
How dare you use my mom and Gang Oh to threaten me?

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.559
You think threatening me...

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:24.089
will scare me into telling you where Woo Jin is?

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:27.189
No. I will never tell you.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.029
You will never find Woo Jin.

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:33.269
How did you know about this place?

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.139
Did you memorize the address that time?

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.339
You mean the day you pretended to be drunk?

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.849
- Oh, thank you. Bye. - Yes, thank you.

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:48.019
- Should I ring the bell for you? - No.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.089
I shouldn't have let her bring me all the way home.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.829
So this is where she lives.

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:05.429
That house.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.669
It's the Yeongmi Pharma Chairman's home, right?

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:10.099
I tutored their youngest daughter when she was a senior.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.539
Twice a week.

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.809
Are you scared that I know where you live?

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.689
- Get in. Let's talk elsewhere. - Why should I?

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.989
You came to my mom's restaurant, where you had no right to be,

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:32.389
just to drag me out and threaten me.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.259
You're the one who spirited Woo Jin away.

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:38.899
Woo Jin wanted to be independent and live his own life,

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.229
so I helped him.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.999
So don't even think about trying to control his life anymore.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.539
From now on, Woo Jin...

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.709
won't live the life you demand. I won't let you do that to him.

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:52.549
He's my brother. And my friend.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.579
I am Woo Jin's mother.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.889
You gave him a transplant, and now you think you're a big lifesaver?

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.159
- I gave birth to him. - And to me as well.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:07.329
You returned for Woo Jin because you needed him for your marriage,

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.429
while you abandoned me because I was useless.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.969
How dare you keep calling yourself a mother?

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.569
Just let me get in touch with Woo Jin.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.839
You think I won't go...

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.109
to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan with no number?

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.509
You can go, but you won't be able to see him.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.449
I've already made all the arrangements.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.579
Can you provide for him? His tuition? His living expenses?

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.689
I think one million dollars should be plenty.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.559
One million dollars?

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.959
You might not like it, but this is how I handle things.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.129
(Cashier's Check: One Million Dollars)

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.699
It's one million dollars.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.529
For Woo Jin's sake,

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.669
cut off all contact with him.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.669
Is that a request?

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:49.869
You're not saying...

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.169
that was in the deal for just a million, are you?

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.709
That one million dollars...

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.449
I gave it to Woo Jin.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.579
What?

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.489
You gave him the one million dollars?

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.189
Why would you? No, seriously, why are you doing this?

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.989
I really don't understand you at all.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.459
Oh, I see.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.499
You wanted to get revenge on me.

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.999
After pretending to be so nice, you just wanted revenge on me.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.339
If I wanted revenge,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.279
I'd have come to you when I knew you filed my death certificate.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.519
- A death certificate? - You even filed one.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.119
So you could remarry some rich guy,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.989
you filed a fake death certificate for your living daughter.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:43.759
Without a body.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.489
So, on what grounds did you file a death certificate?

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.729
Wait a minute, Eun Oh.

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.799
You probably told your new husband you only had one son.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.469
That's why you only took Woo Jin from the orphanage,

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.339
but in the family registry, there was a daughter, plain as day.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.639
So you had to kill her off. Am I wrong?

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.709
What are you talking about? What's your proof? This is crazy!

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.179
You're dying to know, aren't you?

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.489
But you know what?

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.319
She raised my twin brother, though. But she just abandoned me.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.559
So...

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.259
what do you think she told her new husband?

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:23.929
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.999
Ji Hyuk.

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:27.899
Let's make one last stop before we go.

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:32.169
My family registry certificate might not be the most recent one.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:33.309
Let me check for you.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.239
Ji Eun Oh?

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.349
Excuse me.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.149
What's the process for posthumous organ donation?

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.049
- Pardon? - Well...

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:47.889
To donate everything possible, what are my options?

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.129
I'll take that. You can help him. I just need to check the date.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.229
Yes, since I'm already here, I might as well check.

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:02.999
- Right this way, please. - Okay.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.289
(Detailed Family Registry)

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:24.859
Han Woo Jin?

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.129
Same name as Woo Jin.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.369
(Han Yu Ra, Deceased)

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.869
(Han Yu Ra, Deceased)

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:39.769
I did it for you.

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:42.379
Because the full adoption had already gone through.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.239
And something like that...

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.649
Does your husband know?

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.219
Now, I can see right through you.

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:56.359
I knew when I saw you hide Woo Jin's liver transplant from your husband.

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.389
The one thing you can't bear to lose...

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.599
That's what your husband is to you, Ko Seong Hui. Your rock.

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:05.599
How much does that husband of yours know?

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.769
He doesn't know about Woo Jin's liver transplant,

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.509
and he doesn't know the daughter you abandoned was the donor.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:14.569
But the fact that you secretly registered your daughter...

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.449
as deceased before you remarried...

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.509
Does he know about that?

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.519
Do you really have to take it this far?

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.079
This isn't even your life.

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.389
If you mess with Woo Jin or my family,

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.189
I will tear your life apart.

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.659
I will walk right through that door to your husband and your family.

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:37.859
Eun Oh.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.539
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.169
You've lost.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:48.009
It's no use getting on your knees and begging me now.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.409
So just give me an answer.

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.409
Eun Oh, please...

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.219
Not answering me?

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.419
You are not seriously expecting that...

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:03.289
just because you are his birth mother,

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:07.289
I will not expose you for Woo Jin's sake, are you?

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.829
Eun Oh! Hey, Eun Oh!

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.639
May I help you?

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.119
Sorry, I was looking for the home of the Yeongmi Pharma chairman,

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.489
but I must have the wrong address.

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:45.769
Answer me.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:49.599
What's it going to be?

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.079
- You just had to... - Give up on Woo Jin and leave us.

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:02.149
And never show your face to me again.

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:07.689
Aren't you going to answer?

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:14.489
Fine.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.269
You are truly...

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:20.499
disgusting.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:36.749
Wait, Eun Oh?

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:41.459
Why...

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:57.599
Eun Oh.

00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:02.139
Vice President. What are you doing here?

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:09.679
Eun Oh, why are you with my mother?

00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:31.509
So you know each other?

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:44.719
Don't tell me...

00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:48.419
Is she your birth mother?

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:01.569
Mother.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.439
So you're Eun Oh's birth mother?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.939
Woo Jin had a liver transplant? Is that right, Eun Oh?

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:21.219
Seong Jae. Please, let's talk.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.929
I should get going.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:37.569
I'll give you a ride.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:39.339
No, that's okay.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:41.269
It looks like you two...

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:44.979
have a lot to talk about. I'll get going.

00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:52.789
What am I going to do?

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:59.829
Look...

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.699
Let's go talk somewhere else.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:06.269
Let's go.

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:13.669
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.649
Answer it. It's Dad.

(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:34.329
- Hello? - Hey. Where are you?

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:36.559
I'm just outside the house.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:38.369
I'll be right in.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:41.899
Seong Jae.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.069
Seong Jae.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:51.309
- I'm home. - Hey.

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:53.509
- Dad. - How did you two get home together?

00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:57.449
We just ran into each other outside and talked for a bit.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:01.389
Really? Hey, honey. I waited for you to shave my neck.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.989
I wanted to get it done before I showered.

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:06.759
That's right. It's already been ten days.

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:09.399
Go ahead and shower. I'll get the shaver and be right in.

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.659
Okay.

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:34.149
Gosh, why are my feet so swollen?

00:12:40.229 --> 00:12:41.389
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:46.799
What brings you here so late? It's almost midnight.

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:49.839
I couldn't bring myself to go home.

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:52.209
Why not?

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:53.839
Did something happen?

00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.479
You're scared, aren't you?

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:01.679
Look, your hands are trembling.

00:13:03.319 --> 00:13:06.919
If Mr. Park tells his father,

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.689
it'll be my fault that she gets exposed.

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:11.059
And she can't afford for that to happen.

00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:14.989
Her priority is using Woo Jin to get ahead.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:18.059
So she'll go after my mom and Gang Oh.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.999
Knowing where she lived was your last card.

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:23.869
And of all people,

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:26.069
you had to run into Seong Jae.

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:30.109
What's Mr. Park's father like?

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:34.779
What do you think will happen when he finds out the truth she's hiding?

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:38.789
How can anyone live with themselves after learning that? It's inhuman.

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:41.419
Just look at you now.

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:43.519
You're completely terrified.

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:46.659
If they get a divorce over this,

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:50.499
I'm sure she'll make me pay for ruining her life.

00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:56.199
What if she goes after my mom and Gang Oh?

00:13:57.239 --> 00:13:58.469
What do I do?

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:09.449
What's wrong?

00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:15.319
No, I...

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:17.719
I guess I was just a little shocked.

00:14:18.689 --> 00:14:19.989
My chest hurts a bit.

00:14:21.229 --> 00:14:24.199
I'll tell Seong Jae to say nothing about this tonight,

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:26.699
so try not to worry too much.

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:31.239
What about your mother and your brother?

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:34.309
I'll make it so they can't function in society.

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:36.209
Especially your brother.

00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:42.219
He'll never work or run a business for as long as he lives.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.499
You said she remarried, right?

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:57.099
What about her husband?

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.329
Tell him his wife left her daughter...

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.529
and came back just for her liver.

00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:04.099
- You don't think that'll work? - I came back because I missed home.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:07.109
Dad, I'll only be here for one week.

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:12.649
What were you thinking, coming back without even a call?

00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:15.579
You were that woman all along?

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.749
So all these schemes were your doing?

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.359
Looks like Dad's done with his haircut.

00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:33.529
Seong Jae.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:37.239
- You have to hear my side of it. - To our entire family,

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:40.239
you lied about Woo Jin needing a transplant.

00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:43.979
You found the daughter you abandoned and made her give up her liver.

00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:47.909
Am I wrong about any of that?

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.589
Seong Jae. How can you be so rash?

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:55.989
Have you even thought about your father?

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:57.519
Why are you acting like such a child?

00:15:58.359 --> 00:16:01.029
Okay, fine. So you found out one of my secrets.

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:04.329
That's just what you think you know. You haven't even heard my side.

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:09.139
Have you considered what will happen to your father if he hears this?

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:12.139
I'm not naive enough to fall for that nonsense.

00:16:12.869 --> 00:16:15.479
I'm not talking about you. Think about your father.

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.579
Have you thought about how much of a shock this will be for him?

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:24.149
You should at least sleep on it for one night. Right?

00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:27.519
One day won't change anything. I'm not going anywhere.

00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:29.959
How can you, based only on what you think you know,

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:33.029
run and tattle to your father without hearing my side even once?

00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:34.129
As the eldest son!

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:37.829
Then go ahead. Right now.

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:39.629
I'm listening.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.439
Go to work a little late tomorrow.

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.909
Let's talk after your father leaves for work.

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:14.269
Ji Eun Oh.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:16.239
So you went and stirred up trouble after all.

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:25.449
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:27.049
Seong Jae, Eun Oh told me what happened.

00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:30.119
Don't say anything to your father today.

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:32.049
Eun Oh is caught up in this.

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:36.319
What does he mean by that?

00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:42.159
Come to my office tomorrow.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:46.499
I'm home.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.269
- Eun Oh, come home sooner. - Why didn't you answer?

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.869
Sorry. I must've had my phone on vibrate.

00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:56.309
You were all worried, weren't you?

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:59.509
You left right after that woman did. Of course, we were worried!

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:02.219
I had to finish something up at the office.

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:04.979
Hey, let's go buy you a car tomorrow.

00:18:06.189 --> 00:18:08.319
With what money?

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:11.419
Right, you don't have the money?

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:13.529
Wait.

00:18:14.129 --> 00:18:15.329
Mom's got it.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.559
Mom, you have that wedding fund you saved for her, right?

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:23.099
I do. I already gave you car money. Why didn't you buy one?

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.269
See? I knew you would have.

00:18:25.609 --> 00:18:28.169
I'll look up some used car websites. Let's go first thing tomorrow.

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:30.209
Gosh, I can't rest easy with that witch running around.

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:33.109
He's right. You'd be safer in a car.

00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:35.049
- Especially at night. - Yes.

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:37.579
Hey, can you call Yoon and see if they're free?

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.889
- Okay, good idea. - No. Mom, don't make that call.

00:18:41.449 --> 00:18:43.359
I can't buy a car.

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.089
- Why not? - Why?

00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:48.729
That money... I need it for something else.

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:54.899
What? Did you and your boss start talking about marriage?

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:59.669
We're not even dating. What are you talking about?

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:01.739
If you're not getting married, why do you need the money?

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:07.349
Don't tell me you got caught in a romance scam.

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:10.579
You never spend money. Why do you need it now?

00:19:14.249 --> 00:19:16.419
- My gosh. - What? What's wrong?

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:19.859
Look at you, worrying so much about your big sister.

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:24.029
So, it is about a guy.

00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:27.229
Yes, it is.

00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:31.839
I've decided to invest in a guy.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.109
I'm putting up the start-up money,

00:19:34.409 --> 00:19:36.179
and I'll get 50 percent of the profits.

00:19:37.339 --> 00:19:41.509
I only gave you 20,000 dollars. What can you even open with that?

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:47.049
I just got the payout from my turnkey partnership.

00:19:47.589 --> 00:19:48.589
It was a lot.

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:49.859
Absolutely not!

00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:51.459
So you put up all the money,

00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:53.289
and that jerk gets 50 percent for free?

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:57.099
Gosh, you're tangled up with a leech who can smell money.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.899
Absolutely not. You're going to lose all that money.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.939
No, he's not like that. He's someone I can really trust.

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:07.139
Is it the CEO? Did he tell you to invest?

00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:09.709
Hey, Ji Hyuk isn't like that.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:11.539
If it's not him, then who is it? Some other guy?

00:20:12.449 --> 00:20:13.979
It's just... There's someone.

00:20:14.449 --> 00:20:18.379
- Who is this lunatic? - I told you. It's you, Ji Gang Oh.

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:20.519
What? Me?

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:24.989
Mom,

00:20:25.829 --> 00:20:28.799
don't you think Gang Oh can run it on his own now?

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:31.599
What?

00:20:46.209 --> 00:20:47.209
Ji Hyuk?

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:50.879
Ji Hyuk.

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:52.449
Get in.

00:20:53.349 --> 00:20:54.789
But yesterday...

00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:58.089
I bet, "Last night was different. Why are you here in broad daylight?"

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:00.259
You were up all night, weren't you?

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.859
I thought you'd nod off on the bus, so I came to pick you up.

00:21:05.829 --> 00:21:07.499
But you must be tired too.

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:09.799
Get in.

00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:23.479
I guess yawns really are contagious.

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:26.419
Why couldn't you sleep?

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.559
How could I sleep when you're going through that?

00:21:30.719 --> 00:21:31.719
Here.

00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:41.069
- Here you go. - Thanks.

00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:51.379
I'm starting to feel human again.

00:21:53.409 --> 00:21:56.219
Our talk with Seong Jae today is going to be a long one.

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.119
But...

00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:03.389
he will want to tell his father, won't he?

00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:13.699
Gosh, this is insane, right?

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:20.039
Why does the kind VP's stepmom have to be your birth mother?

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:22.779
This is exactly why I don't believe in God.

00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:24.339
Tell me about it.

00:22:24.979 --> 00:22:26.649
I wanted to put it all behind me so badly.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.579
I never thought I'd be pulled back in like this.

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:31.519
Hey, Eun Oh. Stop.

00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:35.019
Until we've heard from the Vice President,

00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:37.889
let's not even talk about her. Gosh, thinking of her is stressful.

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:40.989
- My head's going to explode. - Okay, I totally get it.

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:47.769
So...

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:51.099
that was Ji Hyuk's excuse to pick you up?

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:53.109
I was a little scared.

00:22:53.509 --> 00:22:55.239
I guess that's why he came this morning.

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:01.549
Ji Hyuk is surprisingly thoughtful.

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:03.619
Right?

00:23:05.849 --> 00:23:08.389
Thoughtful? Then why that marriage?

00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:11.889
Hey, do you really think you'll never forgive him for that?

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:14.889
That wasn't a mistake.

00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:18.899
It was just a side of him I never knew existed.

00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:23.599
He's not pressuring you. He's being very subtle.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:28.339
How he's patiently waiting for you can make anyone's heart flutter.

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:30.739
Hey.

00:23:31.439 --> 00:23:33.979
Do you really have no feelings for Ji Hyuk at all?

00:23:34.449 --> 00:23:35.919
Is there really zero chance?

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:40.549
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:45.459
You should think carefully before he gets tired of waiting.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.359
Seeing how much he's changed, that whole wedding fiasco...

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.059
I'd be more than willing to just pretend it never happened.

00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:55.699
It's a broken plate. You can't put it back together.

00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:59.669
Yeong Ra?

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.449
It was on the bed.

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:12.889
And it's addressed to "Father."

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:14.949
What on earth is this?

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:20.329
(To Father)

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:28.069
Father. I am moving out.

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:33.709
I'm legally an adult, and I won't take financial support.

00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:35.409
I'm going to stand on my own two feet.

00:24:36.479 --> 00:24:39.209
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.549
What is this nonsense? She's moving out?

00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:44.749
Wait, does this mean Yeong Ra ran away yesterday?

00:24:46.449 --> 00:24:47.619
You didn't know about this?

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:53.929
No... I just thought she went to her room to rest early.

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:58.229
So you're telling me you didn't check if she was home?

00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:01.929
What's been going on with Yeong Ra?

00:25:04.939 --> 00:25:09.139
She was at my office two days ago, saying she'll be a webtoon artist.

00:25:09.379 --> 00:25:12.209
Of course, I told her no. And now, this...

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:13.509
She ran away?

00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:16.379
Webtoon? Yeong Ra?

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:22.859
I tried to talk her out of it, but it seemed like a phase.

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:28.589
Honey, I told you.

00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:32.399
If we wait for Mr. Lee to quit, she'll come around on her own.

00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:34.869
The trial is just a few days away.

00:25:35.869 --> 00:25:38.439
So what? You're not going to go get her?

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:39.939
We're just going to let her be?

00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:44.509
I feel dizzy. I think it's from the shock.

00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:48.109
For now, just tell her you'll allow it.

00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.349
I can't go out today.

00:25:53.449 --> 00:25:55.549
Fine, stay in. Take your medicine and rest.

00:25:58.289 --> 00:25:59.359
(From: Park Yeong Ra's Studio)

00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:24.149
Sit down. I sent the housekeepers away.

00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:38.459
How do you know Eun Oh?

00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:40.429
How long have you known?

00:26:41.429 --> 00:26:43.599
How could the two of you possibly know each other?

00:26:44.439 --> 00:26:46.609
We have known each other for years. We are close friends.

00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:49.839
I knew she was adopted,

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.979
and that she met her birth mother through a twist of fate.

00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:55.149
Her birth mother showed up because...

00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:59.519
her son needed a liver transplant, which Eun Oh ended up doing.

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:02.919
I know the whole story.

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.819
My goodness...

00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:08.389
When I first heard her story,

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.359
I wondered what kind of monster her mother was.

00:27:12.129 --> 00:27:14.629
I even said I'd find out who she was and ruin her.

00:27:15.399 --> 00:27:17.669
I was just so appalled, angry, and dumbfounded.

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.309
So in your eyes, I'm the villain.

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:25.339
But there were circumstances beyond my control.

00:27:28.379 --> 00:27:29.419
Then tell me what they are.

00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:31.479
You said you'd tell me today.

00:27:33.349 --> 00:27:34.419
You first.

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:36.559
What do you plan to do?

00:27:37.819 --> 00:27:39.089
I have to tell Dad.

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:41.729
And what good would that do?

00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:43.259
Who does that help?

00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.999
It's not about who it helps. I'm doing it because you were wrong.

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:50.499
I can't let him be fooled...

00:27:51.699 --> 00:27:53.569
by someone like you any longer.

00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:56.779
Someone like me? And what kind of person is that?

00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:01.809
- Are you playing games with me? - You.

00:28:02.409 --> 00:28:04.479
Do you have any idea what I am to your father?

00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:08.949
When your mother left your father, I filled the void in his heart.

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:10.819
I gave birth to his adorable daughter, Yeong Ra.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:13.259
I'm the one who raised you since you were seven years old.

00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:17.959
I devoted my life to his happiness. That's who I am.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:21.969
- That's a lie! It's just for show. - What's a lie? What's for show?

00:28:22.769 --> 00:28:24.969
I loved and respected your father.

00:28:25.369 --> 00:28:28.309
Why? Because I needed him.

00:28:30.639 --> 00:28:32.579
How can a person like you...

00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:34.909
even be capable of loving my father?

00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:38.519
Did you not love Ji Eun Oh, your own daughter?

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.489
Do you want to know why?

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.829
There are reasons you'll understand if you hear me out.

00:28:47.489 --> 00:28:51.359
But when you're acting this rashly, how can I tell you the whole story?

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:53.429
You've only heard her side of the story.

00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:55.729
About how I could just abandon my own daughter?

00:28:56.369 --> 00:28:58.239
Do you know what it's like for a mother to give up her child?

00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:00.039
You and Ji Eun Oh have no idea what that is like.

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.469
In front of my father,

00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:04.309
let's call Eun Oh and have it out, all three of us.

00:29:05.309 --> 00:29:07.879
Fine. Do it if you must. But hear me out first.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:12.849
Go on. Tell your father all the "facts" you think you know.

00:29:13.689 --> 00:29:16.359
Tell him his wife has a secret he never knew about.

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:20.559
What do you think your father will do when he hears all this?

00:29:21.729 --> 00:29:24.129
You know exactly what your father is like, don't you?

00:29:24.699 --> 00:29:27.099
For him, trust is everything.

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:31.569
If he feels trust has been betrayed, he might even file for a divorce.

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:34.309
And what good would that do? Who would that help?

00:29:35.469 --> 00:29:39.309
He wouldn't trust a woman again and live a very lonely life.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:44.149
Seong Jae.

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:47.919
I've lived a life I can't explain,

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:50.759
and I'm capable of doing things you wouldn't understand.

00:29:51.989 --> 00:29:55.589
But what's important here is my relationship with your father.

00:29:56.299 --> 00:29:58.229
Woo Jin? Eun Oh's liver transplant?

00:29:58.899 --> 00:30:02.129
That was a mother saving her child. What would you know?

00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:04.069
Your own mother walked out on you, too.

00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:08.539
You wouldn't understand.

00:30:08.969 --> 00:30:10.779
Even when you become a father, you still won't understand.

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.509
You can't even comprehend the situation.

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:15.009
Why insist on letting him find out? Just like your mother,

00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:17.679
do you want to be the one to hurt him this time?

00:30:18.749 --> 00:30:20.619
How is that me hurting him?

00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:22.349
What you're trying to do!

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:25.819
You might as well be slitting my throat.

00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:29.499
You really want to swing that blade in front of your father?

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:33.869
And make him watch as it chops my head right off?

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:35.769
What I want...

00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:39.069
is for my father to stop living a lie.

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:40.409
I want my father...

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.879
to see you for who you really are.

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:45.609
Really?

00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:47.409
Fine.

00:30:47.949 --> 00:30:51.319
If he learns what I'm "really" like, will he just find another woman?

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:53.719
He'd be too scared to even try.

00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:56.119
Is that what you want? For him to grow old all alone?

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:00.489
You are horrifyingly selfish.

00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:03.029
It's only selfish if I'm the one who benefits alone.

00:31:03.429 --> 00:31:06.059
But I'm important to your dad, too.

00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:09.699
He was happy because of me. That's all that matters.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:11.999
What does it matter what kind of woman I am,

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:13.409
if I made him happy?

00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:17.439
Just look the other way this one time.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:20.979
I promise I'll make sure your father lives and dies a happy man.

00:31:21.809 --> 00:31:24.879
Love? There are many kinds of love.

00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:26.719
Being needed... That's a kind of love, too.

00:31:29.349 --> 00:31:30.889
That's for my father to decide.

00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:34.359
Your father needs me.

00:31:37.999 --> 00:31:39.969
So please don't do this, Seong Jae.

00:31:40.929 --> 00:31:42.839
You're not a rash person.

00:31:43.899 --> 00:31:46.369
Don't think about me. Think about your father.

00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:48.709
That's what's important.

00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:52.339
He would be the most devastated if he found out the truth.

00:31:54.449 --> 00:31:56.849
So please, just let it go.

00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:58.749
I'm begging you.

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:06.089
So this is what you did to Eun Oh, too.

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:13.999
Please, think about it carefully for a few days, Seong Jae.

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:39.059
Yeong Ra.

00:32:40.429 --> 00:32:41.429
Yeong Ra.

00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:45.059
Really? You actually slept well?

00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:46.629
Yes.

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:48.829
I didn't wake up once.

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.139
Is your throat sore?

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:54.139
It must have been too cold in there.

00:32:55.209 --> 00:32:56.409
(Bamboo Salt)

00:32:56.409 --> 00:32:57.409
Here, have this.

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:00.779
What's this?

00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:13.829
Wow, this is so handy. This is great.

00:33:14.229 --> 00:33:15.759
I should really get a bed in here.

00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.359
Wait, are you seriously going to live here?

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:20.469
You just ran away from home. Aren't you scared?

00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:22.369
No one knows I ran away.

00:33:24.099 --> 00:33:25.669
Can you believe it? I haven't heard from a single soul.

00:33:27.069 --> 00:33:28.339
How could they?

00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:32.679
Maybe they're doing it on purpose.

00:33:32.949 --> 00:33:35.449
They think you'll pout for a bit and then come home.

00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:38.979
Hey. That's not how my world works.

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:43.559
Woo Jin.

00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:48.489
My mom is losing her mind over Woo Jin.

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:52.999
You're here.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:58.869
Eun Oh.

00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:01.339
Let's go to my office.

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:17.459
First of all, I'm sorry.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.089
Eun Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:34:21.329 --> 00:34:23.629
I'm sorry, too.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.199
And thank you.

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:32.769
For saving my brother, Woo Jin.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:35.939
That's strange.

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:39.409
Hearing you call Woo Jin your brother.

00:34:42.509 --> 00:34:43.619
You're both innocent,

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:46.079
so stop apologising to each other.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.959
Now, let's just hear what that shameless woman told you.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.729
What do you think?

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.799
You want to tell your father, don't you?

00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:00.399
Of course, I do.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.199
I wanted to tell him yesterday, right then and there,

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:05.469
but I barely managed to hold back after I got your text.

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:07.769
And thanks to that,

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.479
I had to listen to all of her disgusting, twisted logic.

00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:13.779
But...

00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:16.619
what did you mean that Eun Oh is caught up in this?

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.289
There's a reason Eun Oh went to see her yesterday.

00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:25.119
I was the one who snuck Woo Jin out.

00:35:26.789 --> 00:35:27.989
Behind Director Ko's back.

00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:30.629
I helped him get discharged and just disappear.

00:35:31.959 --> 00:35:32.959
You did?

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:35.869
To steal your position,

00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:39.269
she spent Woo Jin's entire life brainwashing and grooming him.

00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:41.609
That's why she needed him to be healthy.

00:35:46.949 --> 00:35:48.309
Is that what Woo Jin told you?

00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:52.479
But he said he never wanted to do it.

00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:55.789
He's been under her thumb since he was a kid,

00:35:56.249 --> 00:35:58.719
so he didn't know any other way.

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:03.659
Eun Oh gave him the needed courage. That's why she helped him.

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.399
But she found out and threatened...

00:36:06.399 --> 00:36:08.529
that unless Eun Oh told her where he was,

00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:11.269
she would go after her family.

00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:15.269
No way.

00:36:16.269 --> 00:36:18.109
That's why I went to her house.

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:21.209
To tell her, "I know where you live."

00:36:21.509 --> 00:36:25.079
"So give up on Woo Jin, and don't touch my mom or Gang Oh."

00:36:25.649 --> 00:36:27.319
"Or I'll tell your husband everything."

00:36:28.249 --> 00:36:30.019
I gave her an ultimatum.

00:36:31.459 --> 00:36:33.529
And that's what I walked in on.

00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:36.659
If your father...

00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:40.529
finds out about her past and what she's done to Eun Oh,

00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:41.899
what do you think he'll do?

00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:44.599
I'm not sure.

00:36:45.499 --> 00:36:47.569
He trusted my stepmother completely,

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.569
so I guess he'd divorce her.

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:53.209
My father absolutely cannot stand being deceived or betrayed.

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:59.149
If her past is exposed because of me and she loses her position,

00:36:59.849 --> 00:37:01.619
she'll never just let it slide.

00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:05.089
That's why, Seong Jae...

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:08.889
I think it's best not to tell your father just yet.

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:15.569
I get what both of you are saying, but...

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:18.399
not telling my father...

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:21.069
means I'd be letting him live a lie, right?

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:22.409
Don't you remember?

00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:26.979
I said we'd find and humiliate her. I said that.

00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:30.519
So how can I let her stay with him? That's just betraying my own father.

00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:32.649
I know. You're right.

00:37:33.949 --> 00:37:36.319
Seong Jae. But...

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:39.359
Eun Oh is a victim here, too.

00:37:47.129 --> 00:37:48.499
Blackmail is just talk.

00:37:49.169 --> 00:37:51.639
How can someone actually hurt you over words?

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.069
She will.

00:37:53.539 --> 00:37:54.639
She's the type of person who would.

00:37:56.039 --> 00:38:00.279
She'd do anything to get her way, even using Woo Jin.

00:38:00.709 --> 00:38:04.479
If she loses what she has now, she'll blame me for taking it.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:05.649
That's the kind of person she is.

00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:08.189
Seong Jae.

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:10.859
Let's just take a little more time to think this through.

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.289
Of course...

00:38:13.629 --> 00:38:16.329
I know you're the most confused, but...

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:29.209
My gosh, have you lost more weight?

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.339
It sucks that you have to go through all this.

00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:36.579
Su Bin's not hurt, is she?

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:40.089
No. She's one tough cookie.

00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:42.849
She's resilient.

00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:45.189
I'm heading out.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.939
Hi, Binnies!

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:59.639
Cherry blossom season is just around the corner.

00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:03.379
The same old trench coat and striped tee? No, no.

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:06.139
This year, let's put together the perfect flower-viewing outfit...

00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:07.479
with a vintage grandma-core vibe.

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:15.689
Su Bin, can I use your laptop for a minute?

00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:18.419
- Yes, it's in the living room. - Okay. Thanks.

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:22.389
First, mix and match a floral print like this with some plaid...

00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:25.999
They look great together, right?

00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:31.299
Applying for the certified electrician position.

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:33.709
(Application complete, your resume has been sent.)

00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:37.279
(Hiring: Industrial Electrician)

00:39:37.339 --> 00:39:38.339
All right.

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.609
Daegu, Gwangju... I don't care where.

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:45.119
I just really hope one of them hires me. Please.

00:39:46.749 --> 00:39:47.749
Oh, man...

00:39:49.089 --> 00:39:51.459
(Jamun Medical Devices)

00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:54.489
Anyone here?

00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:57.529
What are you doing here?

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.469
I came to keep an eye on the woman who's giving me spending money...

00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:03.699
during my month off, while I just goof around.

00:40:04.439 --> 00:40:06.039
Honestly, Sang Cheol.

00:40:06.469 --> 00:40:08.509
So you've finally decided to take a break?

00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:12.109
It's getting colder, so there's no more labourer work.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:14.679
The roads are slippery, so delivery is out,

00:40:15.049 --> 00:40:17.749
and a steady part-time job is tough when I have interviews to go to.

00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:21.389
So thanks to my wife, I'm thinking of taking a month off.

00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:23.659
Good thinking.

00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:25.689
Since you're here, why don't you try lying down on this?

00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:30.059
- The heat will loosen you up. - I'm fine. Just hurry and pack up.

00:40:30.259 --> 00:40:33.229
Okay. My boss will be here in about five minutes.

00:40:36.569 --> 00:40:38.039
How's Su Bin doing?

00:40:38.969 --> 00:40:40.369
She's not showing it at all.

00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:43.739
I saw her filming in the storeroom, and she seemed fine.

00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:46.239
She's holding it together well.

00:40:47.149 --> 00:40:49.679
Then again, they weren't dating for that long.

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:52.719
Anyway, it's a good thing we put a stop to it early.

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:57.519
Right. It's common for young people to get together and break up.

00:40:57.659 --> 00:40:58.989
They'll forget each other soon enough.

00:40:59.959 --> 00:41:04.559
Especially kids Su Bin's age. Their feelings change in a flash.

00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:07.569
I got ingredients.

00:41:07.569 --> 00:41:09.599
Su Bin loves your tteokbokki, so please make some.

00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:12.599
Eating it with Ha Eun will probably cheer her up.

00:41:13.569 --> 00:41:15.339
You're more worried about your daughter than you let on.

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:21.279
You want me to eat tteokbokki?

00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:24.649
Yes. Why isn't Ha Eun coming down?

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.889
Ha Eun left as soon as we finished filming.

00:41:27.489 --> 00:41:30.389
Wow, you even put in a ton of fish cakes. I love these.

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:33.089
Your dad bought all the ingredients.

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:34.589
Thanks, Dad.

00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:43.269
This is delicious.

00:41:46.399 --> 00:41:48.969
- Eat up. They're easy to digest. - Okay.

00:42:01.889 --> 00:42:02.889
Su Bin.

00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:04.759
Yes?

00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:07.629
You're spacing out. What's on your mind?

00:42:07.929 --> 00:42:10.259
It's just...

00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:13.469
I was wondering if these were made with rice flour or wheat flour.

00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:19.669
Since when do I ever use ones made with wheat?

00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:21.439
That's true.

00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:26.679
I'm planning a vlog and might make tteokbokki for it.

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:33.119
Take a bowl upstairs and eat there. You've been so busy lately.

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.019
Yes.

00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:52.939
Did you just see the look in her eyes?

00:42:53.399 --> 00:42:54.939
They were completely vacant.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.639
I know. But why doesn't she let it show?

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:01.749
I wish she'd just blame us or something.

00:43:03.049 --> 00:43:04.079
I know.

00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:07.349
I can't tell if she's just mature or secretly angry.

00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.289
I thought I knew her inside and out.

00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:12.759
I have no idea what's going on in her head.

00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:38.019
This is a video of Seong Jae from your grandma's fashion show.

00:43:38.279 --> 00:43:40.319
I wasn't going to give this to you since I heard you broke up,

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:42.389
but after seeing you today, I figured you should have it.

00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:45.819
A video of Seong Jae?

00:44:07.909 --> 00:44:08.979
Seong Jae.

00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:11.619
If I didn't get to see you today,

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:13.789
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

00:44:14.389 --> 00:44:15.489
I like you.

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:18.289
I like you a lot.

00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:20.689
All I can think about...

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:23.259
is you.

00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:29.399
So that's how he looked at me.

00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:33.239
How did I look at him?

00:44:34.669 --> 00:44:35.769
I miss you.

00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:38.679
I miss you so much.

00:44:40.449 --> 00:44:41.509
What do I do?

00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:51.519
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:44:57.029 --> 00:45:00.669
Really? Hey, honey. I waited for you to shave my neck.

00:45:00.769 --> 00:45:02.299
I wanted to get it done before I showered.

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:04.239
I can't let him be fooled...

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:06.239
by someone like you any longer.

00:45:06.669 --> 00:45:10.209
Do you have any idea what I am to your father?

00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:14.709
When your mother left your father, I filled the void in his heart.

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:16.549
I gave birth to his adorable daughter, Yeong Ra.

00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:18.719
I'm the one who raised you since you were seven years old.

00:45:19.919 --> 00:45:23.859
I devoted my life to his happiness. That's who I am.

00:45:24.259 --> 00:45:28.189
If her past is exposed because of me and she loses her position,

00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:30.629
she'll never just let it slide.

00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:34.169
I can't deceive my father,

00:45:35.729 --> 00:45:37.969
but if something were to happen to Eun Oh's family...

00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:41.939
I want to talk to Su Bin.

00:45:50.749 --> 00:45:53.749
(All recordings, Su Bin)

00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:58.389
Hey, what were you just doing?

00:46:00.689 --> 00:46:03.159
You were struggling alone again, weren't you?

00:46:05.799 --> 00:46:08.869
Are you still upset about that inner-lining supplier?

00:46:10.129 --> 00:46:12.899
They'd been doing business with our company for 17 years,

00:46:13.239 --> 00:46:14.309
and they got dropped.

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:17.639
Come on. That's not right.

00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:19.939
They set out to deceive you.

00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:23.679
Don't feel guilty for something that was out of your control.

00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:26.249
- But is that... - Is that really okay?

00:46:26.749 --> 00:46:27.749
really okay?

00:46:27.819 --> 00:46:31.859
Yes. I'm just most worried about how you're feeling.

00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:38.259
(All recordings, Su Bin)

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:42.599
Yes. I'm just most worried about how you're feeling.

00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:56.279
Wow, this smells incredible.

00:46:56.649 --> 00:47:00.919
By the way, I called the courthouse. Yang Ji Il's trial isn't delayed.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.389
You're going to ruin my appetite. Why bring him up?

00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:07.759
When the trial ends, you'll be free. Shouldn't you be happy about that?

00:47:09.189 --> 00:47:11.129
Park Yeong Ra! Open this door!

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:13.559
It's my dad.

00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:20.839
You... How could you...

00:47:22.469 --> 00:47:24.779
Lee Ji Wan, what are you doing?

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:27.549
I was on bodyguard duty...

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:29.609
and preparing dinner, sir.

00:47:30.449 --> 00:47:32.419
Dad, didn't you see the tent outside?

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:36.319
Mr. Lee stood guard for me outside my door all night.

00:47:36.389 --> 00:47:37.759
Get out here this instant!

00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:41.329
Fine.

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:47.829
Ji Wan, she ran away?

00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:50.799
Why didn't you tell me things were getting this bad?

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:54.939
I'm her bodyguard, not a snitch.

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:58.009
- What? - And besides,

00:47:58.439 --> 00:48:00.109
you never even asked.

00:48:00.779 --> 00:48:03.919
If you had ever asked me how Yeong Ra was doing,

00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:06.319
I would've asked her and told you what she said.

00:48:07.189 --> 00:48:09.049
Yeong Ra is drawing a webtoon.

00:48:09.489 --> 00:48:12.919
She's really good at it, and she loves it.

00:48:19.499 --> 00:48:20.869
Yeong Ra.

00:48:22.429 --> 00:48:23.529
Wait, are you sick?

00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:25.299
You've been in bed this whole time?

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:28.539
No, I just wanted a quick nap, but...

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:30.579
Hey, why are you back?

00:48:31.239 --> 00:48:32.779
Dad dragged me here.

00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:37.319
Dragged you here? Did I actually drag you here?

00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:41.489
- Why, you... - I came because I feared you might.

00:48:42.849 --> 00:48:43.859
But I...

00:48:44.419 --> 00:48:45.489
I'm just going to leave again.

00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:49.459
- What? You little brat. - Honey!

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.259
You're leaving again?

00:48:54.329 --> 00:48:55.429
Dad...

00:48:56.499 --> 00:48:57.639
Why did you hit me?

00:48:57.999 --> 00:49:01.469
- Go upstairs. - Do you think I deserved to be hit?

00:49:02.169 --> 00:49:04.639
- Lock her in her room! - I'll call the police.

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:06.809
What?

00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:08.279
You'll take away my phone, I'm sure.

00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:11.149
Then I'll open the window and scream all night.

00:49:11.149 --> 00:49:12.449
I'll scream for help.

00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:15.889
"I'm locked in!"

00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:18.489
"Please call the police!"

00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:21.229
This kid...

00:49:24.359 --> 00:49:25.429
And if that doesn't work...

00:49:26.399 --> 00:49:29.529
I'll break the door with my chair. And the window, too.

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:30.769
And I will jump out.

00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:34.269
How dare you say such awful things to your father?

00:49:34.509 --> 00:49:36.639
Dad, answer me.

00:49:37.539 --> 00:49:40.849
Why did I deserve to be hit? And why can't I be a webtoon artist?

00:49:41.149 --> 00:49:42.949
Because you were born the daughter of the Shoe Joy Group.

00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:44.919
You must live up to the part!

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:49.549
I'm Park Yeong Ra, your daughter. I don't have to be Shoe Joy's.

00:49:50.149 --> 00:49:51.159
What?

00:49:51.419 --> 00:49:53.459
Dad, have you ever considered that I might not be normal?

00:49:54.229 --> 00:49:57.229
Always saying "yes" to you and Mom, never seeing my friends...

00:49:57.559 --> 00:49:58.999
Don't you think I was a little too well-behaved?

00:50:00.299 --> 00:50:03.369
Never dating, never going on group or blind dates.

00:50:03.799 --> 00:50:06.439
Everyone always said I was a lovely, demure daughter.

00:50:06.899 --> 00:50:08.639
So, other families would want me for a daughter-in-law.

00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:12.979
I'm supposed to obey my husband, manage the gallery Mom wants me to,

00:50:13.039 --> 00:50:14.509
and just live my life quietly, right?

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:16.609
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

00:50:17.209 --> 00:50:19.119
Who am I supposed to live that life for?

00:50:20.149 --> 00:50:21.149
You...

00:50:21.889 --> 00:50:24.419
- Yeong Ra. - Like the Jinhwa Group,

00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:26.459
just because a family has a higher status,

00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:27.859
am I supposed to marry them without question?

00:50:27.929 --> 00:50:29.289
Even if I'm not in love with him?

00:50:29.389 --> 00:50:31.559
How dare you treat me like I'm some ignorant father?

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:33.899
I told you to marry someone you like,

00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:36.499
as long as his family's status is a match for ours.

00:50:37.199 --> 00:50:40.609
- That's for your own good! - Who says it's for my own good?

00:50:41.009 --> 00:50:42.109
Was it Mom who said that?

00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:45.279
Dad, you really have no idea what's going on.

00:50:46.279 --> 00:50:47.649
Have you ever even paid any attention to me?

00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:52.279
You just left everything up to Mom. Woo Jin, Seong Jae, and me.

00:50:53.449 --> 00:50:55.049
Dad, did you ever care about me at all?

00:50:56.289 --> 00:50:59.119
So why do you always say no to everything, just because?

00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:02.589
Why don't you get it?

00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:04.429
You're the only daughter of the Shoe Joy Group.

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:06.859
I told you! I don't want any of that!

00:51:07.299 --> 00:51:08.869
I'm going to make my own way in life.

00:51:09.669 --> 00:51:12.169
Such classless behaviour.

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.569
How did she turn out like this?

00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:18.439
No, honey. I'll talk some sense into her.

00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:22.449
- Get her upstairs now. - Let me ask you one last thing.

00:51:26.279 --> 00:51:28.089
Dad, do you really want me to be happy?

00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:32.459
If I do as Mom says, will that make me happy?

00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:35.389
- Of course! - How can you be so sure?

00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:39.159
That Mom is always right, and that she's a good person...

00:51:40.199 --> 00:51:41.329
How are you so sure about that?

00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:48.569
Yeong Ra, that's enough. This is so hard on me.

00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:50.369
If you don't give me your permission,

00:51:51.039 --> 00:51:52.279
I can't live in this house anymore.

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:55.949
So please, give me your answer right here and now.

00:51:56.149 --> 00:51:59.449
You little... I said, go upstairs. Get upstairs now!

00:52:00.579 --> 00:52:03.489
- Go upstairs, now! - Father.

00:52:04.919 --> 00:52:06.589
This isn't the way to handle this.

00:52:07.989 --> 00:52:09.589
It's not like Yeong Ra's a criminal.

00:52:11.659 --> 00:52:13.529
Yeong Ra, I'm so sorry.

00:52:14.129 --> 00:52:16.569
I was in too much pain to stop your dad.

00:52:17.129 --> 00:52:21.939
Honey, I'll take her upstairs. You need to calm down.

00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:29.279
Oh, boy...

00:52:30.579 --> 00:52:31.719
Gosh, this...

00:52:34.089 --> 00:52:35.089
For goodness' sake.

00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:36.989
My gosh.

00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:51.339
Are you a fool?

00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:53.299
Did you really not know your dad would react that way?

00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:56.609
I knew he would.

00:52:57.239 --> 00:52:58.439
And you still ran away?

00:52:58.879 --> 00:53:00.439
And you only made it as far as your studio?

00:53:00.779 --> 00:53:04.009
Does it only count as moving out if I run away like Woo Jin did?

00:53:06.649 --> 00:53:07.989
I'm not going to tell Dad.

00:53:08.989 --> 00:53:10.549
I feel too sorry for him to say anything.

00:53:11.959 --> 00:53:13.019
And besides,

00:53:14.059 --> 00:53:15.959
when someone is running away from a person like you,

00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:19.299
would he really tell me or Seong Jae where he's headed?

00:53:19.799 --> 00:53:20.869
Do you really think he'd tell us?

00:53:21.269 --> 00:53:23.129
So you go ahead and try to find him yourself.

00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:26.099
Because I don't know, and I don't want to know either.

00:53:26.999 --> 00:53:28.739
So my children are trying to be the death of me.

00:53:29.709 --> 00:53:31.409
And I haven't even managed to shut Seong Jae up yet.

00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:32.979
That miserable little brat.

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:35.009
If something happens to me,

00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:37.849
do you have any idea what'll happen to you, acting so recklessly?

00:53:38.249 --> 00:53:39.449
You mean the Shoe Joy Group?

00:53:40.279 --> 00:53:41.389
Those shares...

00:53:41.689 --> 00:53:43.689
You're the one who needs them. I already told you I don't.

00:53:44.759 --> 00:53:45.959
Then I'll make you need them.

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.189
Yeong Ra.

00:53:50.689 --> 00:53:51.829
I'm coming in.

00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:54.059
Watch your mouth.

00:53:57.799 --> 00:53:59.499
Did you check on your father's blood pressure?

00:54:00.839 --> 00:54:03.869
It must be through the roof. I should go check it.

00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:08.709
She never misses an opportunity, does she?

00:54:20.659 --> 00:54:21.789
Seong Jae.

00:54:22.629 --> 00:54:23.959
You were pretty shocked, weren't you?

00:54:25.029 --> 00:54:26.059
It's just that...

00:54:26.799 --> 00:54:28.629
I was surprised. That wasn't like you at all.

00:54:31.199 --> 00:54:33.169
Can you tell me what's going on?

00:54:34.269 --> 00:54:35.709
Do you really want to hear my side of the story?

00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:39.609
Are you really curious about why I acted that way?

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:45.919
You've never asked for my opinion, given me advice, or even scolded me,

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:47.419
much less asked me to run an errand.

00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:49.489
You've never done any of those, have you?

00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:56.859
I see. You don't want to talk to me now.

00:54:58.129 --> 00:54:59.899
All right. Get some rest for now.

00:55:03.329 --> 00:55:05.199
See? This is why I can't talk to you.

00:55:06.039 --> 00:55:08.309
You still don't get what I'm saying, and you're just trying to leave.

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:22.749
Honey...

00:55:23.519 --> 00:55:24.719
Have some herbal tea.

00:55:27.419 --> 00:55:28.789
Tell Yeong Ra to come down here.

00:55:32.199 --> 00:55:34.529
I just managed to calm her down.

00:55:34.769 --> 00:55:37.769
I'll just let her draw that webtoon, or whatever it is.

00:55:39.099 --> 00:55:40.099
What?

00:55:42.669 --> 00:55:44.639
Yang Ji Il's trial is in a week.

00:55:45.079 --> 00:55:48.079
And Mr. Lee submitted his notice for the day after.

00:55:48.449 --> 00:55:51.219
For now, once he quits,

00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:56.349
it's probably best to let Yeong Ra burn herself out.

00:56:04.959 --> 00:56:05.959
Dad.

00:56:06.859 --> 00:56:07.869
But...

00:56:08.129 --> 00:56:09.899
you'll have to drive yourself to and from there.

00:56:10.699 --> 00:56:12.339
You know Mr. Lee resigned, right?

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:14.169
I know.

00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:16.369
So I can really work on my webtoon?

00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:18.209
Make your debut within three months.

00:56:18.739 --> 00:56:20.039
If not, you give it up for good.

00:56:21.149 --> 00:56:22.449
But I've already made my debut.

00:56:23.849 --> 00:56:25.079
Yes, I understand.

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.119
Thank you, Dad.

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.419
Her debut in three months?

00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:33.259
Even if she pulls off a miracle, I'll stop it.

00:56:39.199 --> 00:56:40.199
Why are you here?

00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:41.799
I brought you some ice cream.

00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:44.029
Ice cream?

00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:45.899
Are you here to check up on me?

00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:48.569
You always say something sweet makes you feel better.

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:50.109
Pick one.

00:56:52.179 --> 00:56:53.579
Look at your puffy eyes, you punk.

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:58.249
I'm trying not to let it show, so don't worry.

00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:01.219
I know it must be tough.

00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:03.019
So thanks for holding it together.

00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:06.219
Don't worry about me.

00:57:07.019 --> 00:57:09.889
Ji Hyuk. Keep an eye on Dad for me.

00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:17.869
Dad forgot to log out of my laptop, so I saw something.

00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:20.099
He's been applying for jobs as far away as Changwon.

00:57:21.269 --> 00:57:22.909
Why is this pillow so flat?

00:57:27.209 --> 00:57:30.149
You mean he's thinking of moving to the provinces for a job?

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.359
He applied to eight different places all over the country.

00:57:39.519 --> 00:57:41.159
There has to be a way.

00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:57.339
Why aren't you getting ready for work?

00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:01.649
I just feel like being lazy today.

00:58:03.209 --> 00:58:04.309
You should get going.

00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:07.079
All right.

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:15.029
"Please call the police!"

00:58:16.689 --> 00:58:17.689
This kid...

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.769
How could Yeong Ra have changed so much?

00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:31.009
I'm heading out.

00:58:39.619 --> 00:58:41.249
I shouldn't have hit her.

00:59:00.739 --> 00:59:03.769
He won't even ask why I'm not heading out for work.

00:59:05.479 --> 00:59:06.509
Darn it.

00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:09.579
(A new post has been uploaded.)

00:59:11.419 --> 00:59:12.849
(Obituary, Choi Ju Hyeong, Disaster Prevention Room)

00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:16.789
The first obituary for one of my employees.

00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:18.959
I should send a condolence wreath.

00:59:21.989 --> 00:59:23.629
(Obituary, Choi Ju Hyeong, Disaster Prevention Room)

00:59:24.459 --> 00:59:25.559
The Disaster Prevention Room?

00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:33.769
I have arrived!

00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:35.839
The one and only, writer Park Yeong Ra.

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:39.739
You're amazing, Park Yeong Ra. I honestly didn't think you'd do it.

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.309
You're surprised, right?

00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:43.609
I also didn't expect it to be so fast.

00:59:44.779 --> 00:59:48.049
- This is amazing! - Hey! You're crushing the cake!

00:59:50.389 --> 00:59:51.859
Who cares about the cake right now?

00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:56.029
You've got a point.

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:04.229
Dad, you really have no idea what's going on.

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:06.539
Have you ever even paid any attention to me?

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.739
You just left everything up to Mom. Woo Jin, Seong Jae, and me.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.509
Dad, did you ever care about me at all?

01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:15.509
Their mother was handling everything just fine,

01:00:15.909 --> 01:00:18.619
and I'd hear about it from her, so I didn't need to step in.

01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:21.349
What does she know?

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.659
Does she think running a company is some kind of joke?

01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:33.559
Raising our kids well for all to see is how I return your love.

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:36.329
After all, you're the one doing great things.

01:00:36.729 --> 01:00:38.639
Don't you worry about a thing.

01:00:38.839 --> 01:00:41.969
She told me not to worry, and now...

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:44.269
all three of our kids have gone off the rails.

01:00:45.079 --> 01:00:46.209
That goes for Woo Jin, too.

01:00:48.749 --> 01:00:50.449
I missed home so much, I had to come back.

01:00:51.379 --> 01:00:53.349
Dad, I'll just stay for a week and then head back.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:01:00.389
Come to think of it, I didn't even buy him a meal.

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:06.659
He should be on winter break by now. When is he coming back, anyway?

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:08.699
Let me see...

01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:10.299
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:11.669
(Han Woo Jin)

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:15.339
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.579
Why isn't he picking up? It's not like he'd be asleep.

01:01:27.719 --> 01:01:28.989
This kid...

01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:34.729
- Sir, your meeting's starting. - Just a minute.

01:01:35.929 --> 01:01:37.059
Darn it.

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:39.199
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:01:39.799 --> 01:01:41.969
Woo Jin, you're not picking up.

01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:43.599
Give me a call.

01:01:48.239 --> 01:01:52.009
He said he'll go to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan for outpatient care.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:55.449
You think I won't go to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan?

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:57.979
You can go, but you won't be able to see him.

01:01:58.379 --> 01:02:00.019
I've already made all the arrangements.

01:02:02.989 --> 01:02:04.289
Why would she do that?

01:02:05.719 --> 01:02:07.759
She knew I'd send people after him,

01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:10.729
yet she openly revealed which hospital in Busan he's at.

01:02:12.299 --> 01:02:13.429
Ji Eun Oh.

01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:16.299
I need to figure out what you're thinking.

01:02:17.499 --> 01:02:18.969
From your point of view.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.409
From the perspective of someone who's had to deal with me.

01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:23.469
I have to read your mind.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:28.579
Call Student Affairs at Woo Jin's school right now...

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.709
and check on his status.

01:02:31.449 --> 01:02:33.919
He's not answering my calls or texts.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:36.189
It's not like him to ignore me like this.

01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:40.789
I don't care if he's in class or collapsed somewhere sick.

01:02:41.659 --> 01:02:45.059
- Tell them I need his location now. - Yes, sir.

01:02:46.399 --> 01:02:47.729
Tell them his father is sick.

01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:51.469
Gosh, this kid...

01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:54.869
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:01.649
So, is he okay? He's not sick or anything?

01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:05.419
- Actually, he is sick, sir. - He is?

01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:08.549
"Actually, he is sick?" What do you mean?

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.319
Han Woo Jin took a leave of absence this semester.

01:03:11.689 --> 01:03:12.689
Due to illness.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:16.129
His cirrhosis required a transplant, so he took a leave of absence.

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.459
And a few days ago, he submitted paperwork to drop out.

01:03:18.459 --> 01:03:19.829
What did you say?

01:03:20.959 --> 01:03:22.529
A liver transplant?

01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:25.039
He dropped out?

01:03:25.839 --> 01:03:29.009
(Shoealls)

01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:31.169
These are the leave of absence and withdrawal forms they emailed me.

01:03:35.609 --> 01:03:36.609
No...

01:03:37.449 --> 01:03:40.819
Woo Jin was sick enough to need a liver transplant?

01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:45.119
Why would he drop out?

01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:49.559
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:03:51.529 --> 01:03:53.259
What in the world is going on?

01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:55.999
This is...

01:04:25.859 --> 01:04:28.199
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:28.499 --> 01:04:31.499
Ji Eun Oh, I've been on your side for over ten years.

01:04:31.669 --> 01:04:34.599
- You're telling me to work here? - Dad got a job.

01:04:34.669 --> 01:04:37.809
I'm not getting married anymore, which means...

01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:39.709
you won't have a son-in-law.

01:04:39.779 --> 01:04:42.249
How could I not have known about something this important?

01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:44.679
You hid this from me. Go gather all of it.

01:04:44.749 --> 01:04:48.289
You punk! Park Seong Jae! How dare you disrespect your father?

01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:50.889
Seong Jae can't say anything. He won't be able to.

01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:53.759
- But what if he talks? - Getting anxious?

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:55.589
You're going to need me, for your own sake.

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:59.999
Why don't you just shut your mouth? Do I have to justify myself to you?
