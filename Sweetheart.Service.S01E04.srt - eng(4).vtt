The weather's really nice today.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.561
- Huh?
- Shooooom~

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.855
It's real…

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.523
Shooooom~

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.859
Mmm-mmm.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.489
- Shooooom~
- Mmm~

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.782
- Hello?
- You were right. It's really happening!

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.577
- Huh?
- It's real!

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.496
- W-Wait, what do you mean it's real?
- Shooooom~

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.874
It's Minwoo!

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.292
Wait, tell me everything!

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.337
Shooooom~

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.176
Oh, got it.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.847
Shooooom~

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:58.850
Hey!

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.645
Is it good?

Jung Minwoo~

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.494
Babe, are you okay?

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.122
What are you doing here?

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.584
I've got wind of something
fun, thought I'd drop by.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:14.843
Hello, I'm Minwoo's boyfriend, Son Yooha.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.054
Nice to meet you.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.978
I had no idea you had
such a handsome boyfriend.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.229
Lucky you, Minwoo~

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.899
Director, don't you have
a meeting this afternoon?

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.110
Let's go, Yooha. I'll walk you out.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.153
Oh?

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:36.781
Hurry.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.282
Okay.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.369
Take care~

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.174
Ugh…

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.261
Ugh…

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.524
Taeha, is something bothering you?

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:14.402
Huh?

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.114
Oh, Yooha's been avoiding my calls lately…

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.700
I'm getting worried.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.288
Yeah, Yooha…

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.750
He seems a little out of it these days…

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.057
- Jaemin.
- Ah!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.811
- It's you, Taeha…
- Ah, sorry.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.440
I'm just wondering if you're
able to contact Yooha.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.943
He's not answering me.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.903
Uh…

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.489
Yeah.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.368
He's not taking my calls either.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.585
He's probably just busy!

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.212
Yeah, that's it…

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.052
Ugh…

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.352
Did you see Minwoo's boyfriend?

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.604
Yeah, I saw them.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.772
Totally lovey-dovey.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.526
- Whoa…
- I didn't think he was that kind of guy…

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.736
They were all over each other…

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:43.157
Ugh, I can't even show my face at work now.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.672
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:08.306
Jaemin.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.105
Taeha?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.736
Jaemin.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.446
About Yooha…

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:23.364
You know something, don't you?

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.870
Please, just tell me the truth.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.581
I think you'd understand…

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.001
How I'm feeling better than anyone.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.590
Taeha…

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.059
Yooha is doing…

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:57.732
a rental boyfriend service.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.944
Rental boyfriend…?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.865
Why?

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.786
He probably needed the money…

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.414
That's probably why he started doing it.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:17.667
Taeha…

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.925
I don't think it was an
easy choice for him.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.056
I'm sure he thought about it a lot.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.310
And there must be a
reason he didn't tell you.

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:38.439
Yeah.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.108
Taeha.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:46.489
If you can just wait a little longer,
he might open up.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:51.911
Yooha knows how much you care for him.

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.583
What are you guys doing?

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.253
- Yooha…
- Yooha.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:02.337
Taeha?

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:04.465
Why are you home so late?

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.677
Taeha, come on. It's not the first time.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.596
Exactly.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:12.849
And I always wait for you.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.475
I told you not to.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.853
Then you could have…

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.981
at least answered your phone.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.943
Okay, sorry…

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.821
If you're done, let's head out.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.990
Jaemin told me…

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:33.536
About that weird part-time job.

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.333
- That rental boyfriend thing…
- I'm sorry.

00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:44.547
Pretending to be someone's boyfriend
just for some cash?

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.800
What if something happens to you?

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.801
Taeha…

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.056
Whatever I do, it's my business, not yours.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.018
You don't need to pay them any mind.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.729
Not my business?

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:01.813
Yooha…

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.902
If something happens to you,
of course it's my business. I raised you!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.447
You think I can just stand
by and let you do whatever?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.826
I don't want to rely on you forever.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.996
I can't keep living like that.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:21.833
Yooha…

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.670
I work because…

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.674
I want to be someone you can lean on
when things get tough.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.130
Have you ever thought about…

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.931
How I feel?

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.350
Even just a little?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.646
I know.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.903
I'll always be thankful and sorry to you.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:52.698
But sometimes…

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.205
It's just too much for me.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.336
I'm sorry, Taeha.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:10.216
I knew I had to be honest with you someday.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.761
After all…

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:21.769
We're still family.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:30.528
Where are you going now?

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.157
I want to try standing on my own.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.831
Ugh…

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.001
Can't believe I've got nowhere to go…

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.838
Feels like I've wasted 24 years…

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.923
I said I'd be fine on my own…

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:36.302
That I could live…

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.721
Without my brother…

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.222
But was that…

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:43.309
Just a lie to myself?

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.688
Everyone else is achieving something…

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.608
Working hard…

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.110
And here I am…

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.490
Stuck in place.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.328
No.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.664
I'm not staying stuck.

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:18.287
- Alright then. Might as well make some money!
- [Strawberry Market / Rangi and Baby] Is anyone available to feed the cat right now?

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.597
I'm available. Where's the location?

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.642
[PotatoFriend]
I'm available!! Where's the location?

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.488
- Yes, Minwoo?
- Thanks for your work today.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:43.160
I wanted to talk about your next task.
Where are you now?

00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:45.161
I'm…

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:48.040
On my way to feed a cat.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.126
What do you mean?

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.670
Actually…

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.926
I had nowhere to go, so I took a night job.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.469
So I'm now in front of the client's place.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.470
Wait…

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.225
So you're going into a stranger's house?

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.934
Yeah… kind of?

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.478
That's too dangerous.

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.188
Tell me the address.

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:12.815
What?

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.065
Now.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.484
Wait at the door.

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:18.028
Uh, okay!

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:21.781
Okay…

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.100
Minwoo…

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.604
Are you into baseball?

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.483
Just brought it in case…

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.192
Huh?

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.652
Let's go in together.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.321
Okay!

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.636
Where's the cat supposed to be?

00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:26.680
You're so suspicious.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.484
Oh!

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.583
- Yooha.
- Yes?

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.544
Go over there.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.296
I'll look for the food.

00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:05.469
- Yooha.
- Yes?

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.971
I think it's over here?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.473
Huh? Uh… Minwoo?

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:13.180
"Sweetheart Service"

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.893
- Hello, I'm Son Yooha. And this is…
- Jung Minwoo.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.854
We have quite a… well,
strange relationship.

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:22.564
Strange?

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.440
Yeah.

00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:27.069
You could say… we're lovers?

00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.280
More like… fake lovers.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.450
Well, either way, don't
we look good together?

00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.244
No way.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.746
Why are you so sure?

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.083
I used to be…

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.710
And now?

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.295
I'm not so sure.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:48.382
Why? What are you unsure about?

00:16:58.892 --> 00:16:59.892
What?

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.314
Are you getting fluttered?

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:06.734
I don't know.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:11.530
If you don't, why don't we figure it out
together, here at Sweetheart Service?

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.742
Help me out, will you?

00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:17.076
- See you soon.
- Huh?

00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:19.037
- Let's meet again.
- See you in the next episode.
