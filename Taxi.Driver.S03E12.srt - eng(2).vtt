00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.035
(Lee Je Hoon)

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:23.065
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.115
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:38.315
(This drama is a work of fiction)

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:39.385
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:41.255
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:42.315
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:44.685
Can you tell me...

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.255
what has happened to you?

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:51.465
(Thank you. You've been phished.)

00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:53.094
What is this?

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.035
If the police weren't going to do anything,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.435
I decided I'd have to fight that jerk my own way.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.505
From that moment on,

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:02.375
he started tormenting me in these bizarre ways.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:05.905
The retaliation against Ms. Yoo from the beginning...

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.945
seems to be a mix of two different M.O.s.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.285
One is meticulous and timid,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.215
like a diligent, low-level con artist.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.555
The other is bold, cruel,

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.685
and enjoys playing sadistic games.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:23.765
So like you said, it's not one guy, but a whole group?

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.365
That voice is our general manager.

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:31.035
Where is he right now?

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.715
It felt like they were freelancers on a platform that jerk provided.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:43.685
That's what I thought was strange too.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.745
It's not like it's some startup,

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:50.115
but believe me, they treated crime like it was some high-paying gig.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.285
They were even bragging about their experience.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:56.095
And since that jerk provided manuals and all the needed supplies,

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.225
it's no wonder it didn't feel like a real crime to them.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:02.595
Given this structure, instead of catching these grunts,

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.805
we have to catch the mastermind, that jerk, who's holed up.

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:08.635
Right.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.105
By the way, what about Chief Choi? Where did he go?

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.645
He wanted to wrap this up himself.

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:22.985
You don't remember my voice, do you?

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.055
No.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.525
Of course you don't. You've scammed too many to remember.

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:31.195
But I...

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:34.665
I remember your voice as clear as day.

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:39.765
(General Manager)

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:44.845
That's how personal this is for me.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:46.845
What?

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:48.415
(General Manager)

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:51.115
What? What's going on?

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:57.325
Are you...

00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:00.155
in some kind of trouble?

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:03.394
(General Manager)

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.365
I'm leaving the country.

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:08.165
I got a better-paying offer.

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.135
Gosh, you scared me. Darn it.

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:16.575
Come on, you have to warn me. This really puts me in a bind.

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:19.445
Sorry.

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:21.745
This was a sudden decision.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:24.115
This was just a really sudden decision.

00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:27.015
Then you know you forfeit your bonus, right?

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:30.015
Yes. I'm sorry.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.295
Gosh, why are kids these days so flaky?

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.865
He'll be posting a new job listing soon.

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:46.635
Good job.

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:54.615
Darn it.

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.355
(Help wanted: High-paying part-time gig)

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:04.885
Chief Choi wrapped things up nicely. The job ad is up.

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:08.795
He said if someone has to infiltrate the jerks' den,

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:12.125
he wants to be the one to go in. He wants to finish the job for good.

00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:13.965
Chief Choi?

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:17.535
I told him no. It's too dangerous as they've already heard his voice.

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:19.835
And I can't go either. I'm too scared.

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:22.035
I'll go.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.405
So? Do I look like a convincing con artist?

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.375
- You bet. - Yes. A total natural.

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:32.485
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:34.715
Hey, I'm not sure if that was a compliment.

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:41.295
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:51.965
Nice shot!

00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:00.175
(Part-Time Job Application: An Go Eun)

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:06.145
(Send a verification photo.)

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.755
Why do they suddenly need a selfie? This is ridiculous.

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.995
Go Eun. Not on your left cheek.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:17.265
You need to make a peace sign on your right cheek.

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:18.865
Oh, on my right cheek.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.535
Isn't this ridiculous?

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:23.465
For a job interview, they just told me...

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:25.765
to send a selfie out of the blue with no explanation.

00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:27.905
What kind of interview is this?

00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:30.845
How does this look?

00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:32.845
Perfect.

00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:34.975
Okay, I'm sending this one.

00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:42.315
So gorgeous.

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.925
She is quite gorgeous.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:21.155
- Hello? - Nice to speak with you, Ms. An.

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:27.065
It's an interview, but it's not in person?

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.905
There's no need to see each other's faces.

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:33.835
As long as we do our jobs well, that's all that matters.

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:37.275
I suppose that's true.

00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:40.505
All that meeting and greeting is just a hassle anyway.

00:06:42.645 --> 00:06:44.045
You have a nice voice.

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:46.285
It's very compelling.

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:50.625
I hear that a lot. They say I'll get great results.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.395
Have you ever done this type of work?

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.365
I've done telemarketing. Recruiting members over the phone.

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:01.535
Then you'll get the hang of this in no time.

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:02.865
Of course.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:06.435
As long as I don't get caught, I know I can do really well.

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:11.545
Forgive me.

00:07:12.275 --> 00:07:14.715
It's just the first time I've had someone say that in an interview.

00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:20.085
Don't get me wrong. I'm not planning to do this long.

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.155
I just need enough for my deposit, and then I'm quitting.

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:24.625
Right, of course.

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:26.555
Let's just work well together until then.

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:28.895
When can you start?

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:30.325
Well...

00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:32.395
Right now?

00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:35.795
I'll send you the address.

00:07:55.615 --> 00:07:56.615
Okay.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:05.595
A box came by courier earlier. It looks like it's for you.

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:10.595
(Work Manual)

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:27.554
- Yes. - Since you're in a study cafe,

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:28.785
just answer me.

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:30.555
- You got the box, right? - Yes.

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.125
The manual explains how you'll be working.

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:36.825
Most of the documents and programs you need are already on the laptop.

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:46.605
Don't upload text for descriptions. Take a screenshot and upload that.

00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:49.705
Because sometimes you get weirdos who copy the text to search for it.

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:50.845
Got it.

00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:53.575
And don't make the description too detailed.

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.975
Just say, "It's a new, unopened birthday gift."

00:08:57.115 --> 00:08:59.885
- That way, you get fewer questions. - Okay.

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.555
You'll figure this out as you go,

00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:03.184
but when you get a call,

00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:06.285
first confirm which item they're calling about.

00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:10.595
- Okay. - As for the rest, read the manual,

00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:13.195
and if you have any questions, ask the person next to you.

00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:14.735
Okay.

00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:26.745
(HelloMarket)

00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:30.275
(National ID Card)

00:09:35.185 --> 00:09:36.615
I'm going to the restroom.

00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:47.265
I'm starting right now.

00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:49.535
But you haven't even finished your training yet, have you?

00:09:50.035 --> 00:09:52.665
If we just wait, more people will get hurt.

00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:56.705
Besides, I've got it all down.

00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:05.215
The study room has a free spot. Let's go over there.

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:07.145
You can take calls more freely there.

00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:09.055
Oh, okay.

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.255
Study room?

00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:14.925
Okay.

00:10:15.895 --> 00:10:17.295
Let's do this.

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:41.985
Wait, what's this ticket for?

00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:47.185
An issue right before the meetup has delayed the deal.

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.895
He got into a car accident on the way or something, right?

00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:52.395
Yes, I think that was it.

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:54.495
So much for that deal.

00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:56.995
What? What a waste.

00:10:57.765 --> 00:10:59.435
You do mind if I try calling them back?

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.175
Knock yourself out.

00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:03.835
Here's the username and password.

00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:15.685
Hello?

00:11:16.115 --> 00:11:18.455
Hi, by any chance, are you the one...

00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:21.355
who was supposed to buy concert tickets from my brother?

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:26.295
- Yes. - My brother was coming to meet you.

00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:28.795
You heard he was in a car accident, right?

00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:30.695
Yes.

00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:32.935
He died.

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:37.175
Why did she go from zero to a hundred like that?

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:41.175
If you still happen to need the tickets,

00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:44.784
I can give them to you for 30 percent off.

00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:45.785
What do you say?

00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:49.315
Well, if you say so, Go Eun, I'll do it.

00:11:50.015 --> 00:11:52.855
Thank you. Just a moment then.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.695
I just sent you the account number. Once you transfer the money,

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:04.465
I'll go to the post office and mail you the tickets right away.

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:08.035
And one more thing. Don't even ask to meet in person.

00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:11.805
Not after how my brother died.

00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:17.785
(7,000 dollars has been transferred to An Go Eun of Seongju Bank.)

00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:22.115
Chief Choi says he just transferred the 7,000 dollars.

00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:28.055
What, 7,000 Dollars? You sent it already?

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:32.225
Okay, then I'll ship the tickets out right now.

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.265
Take care.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:40.305
Go Eun has some serious skills.

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:47.245
Turns out I'm a natural.

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:49.945
And we almost didn't sell it. What a waste that would've been.

00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:57.625
Hey, General Manager, see that?

00:12:58.355 --> 00:12:59.725
Did you see me pull that off?

00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:02.995
Go Eun. I'm impressed.

00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:05.625
I mean, how did you get so good, so fast?

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:07.665
What can I say?

00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:10.295
Just one thing, though.

00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:12.705
You gave them the wrong account number.

00:13:13.635 --> 00:13:15.305
What? There's no way.

00:13:15.575 --> 00:13:17.875
It seems you accidentally gave them your own account number.

00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:20.445
No, I didn't. I gave them the correct one.

00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:23.645
Maybe they just haven't sent the money yet.

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:25.045
Go Eun.

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:29.715
I got your account number so I could pay you your commission. Remember?

00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:31.785
Well, yes.

(Deposit: 7,000 dollars)

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:40.965
I also set up text alerts for any deposits made to it.

00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:45.835
- Remember? - You set up text alerts for it?

00:13:46.235 --> 00:13:49.575
So, don't even think about lying...

00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:52.275
and transfer the money to the designated account.

00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:53.705
Right now.

00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:56.645
So you mean...

00:13:57.945 --> 00:14:02.515
you get those alerts too?

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:05.885
So I'm totally busted, right?

00:14:06.525 --> 00:14:10.425
Okay! You caught me, so I quit. Bye.

00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:11.865
Hello?

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:14.225
Well, that was fun.

00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:15.695
Hello?

00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:20.405
Goodbye, everyone! I'm out of here!

- Hey! What's up with the computer? - What's going on?

00:14:30.415 --> 00:14:32.215
This is ransomware.

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.555
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:36.215
Ransomware?

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.255
What security are you running that you get hit with ransomware?

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:45.365
I'm sending you the kit again.

What do you think you're doing?

00:14:56.435 --> 00:14:57.975
I specifically told you to send all of it.

00:14:58.645 --> 00:14:59.675
What? Why?

00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:01.715
It's my fee for teaching you the ropes.

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:04.145
Besides, I got the money on that call,

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:06.115
so it's all my money. Why would any of it be yours?

00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:08.215
No, Go Eun. You're wrong.

00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:09.715
Hey, I'm talking here.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.754
We did all the work. You just came in at the very end...

00:15:12.755 --> 00:15:14.495
and made one phone call. Am I wrong?

00:15:15.525 --> 00:15:20.065
I guess my voice is more convincing. Hey, even you said so.

00:15:20.895 --> 00:15:21.895
This is your last chance.

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:24.665
While I'm still being nice,

00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:26.635
send me the money.

00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:30.675
Listen to that change in tone. Did I strike a nerve?

00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:33.375
Did our dear General Manager get triggered?

00:15:33.945 --> 00:15:35.275
Are you triggered?

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:57.435
This stupid woman...

00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:01.375
has no idea who she's messing with.

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.605
What do you think, Mango Seven?

00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:09.315
I said, what do you think?

00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:18.585
That darn idiot. How dare she...

00:16:18.925 --> 00:16:20.485
mess with me?

00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:24.665
Fine.

00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:26.825
Let's see which one of us goes down.

00:16:28.865 --> 00:16:32.135
But do you really think that jerk will take the bait?

00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:35.005
We'll be in a tough spot if he doesn't.

00:16:35.335 --> 00:16:36.575
I've already told everyone.

00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:42.645
Are they really coming? We're all starving over here.

00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:46.215
- Are they really on their way? - Just wait a little longer, please.

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:48.915
What?

00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:54.525
- They're here! Thank goodness. - Over here!

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:56.425
- This way. - Come on, this way. All the way in.

00:16:56.795 --> 00:16:59.795
- This way. All right, over here. - Come on in.

00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:01.495
This way.

00:17:02.065 --> 00:17:05.165
Okay, this way. All right, this way.

00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:07.565
The delivery drivers! They actually came!

00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:10.805
Right this way.

00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:13.375
Your delivery has arrived.

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:18.815
Could you take care of the bill?

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:24.015
Hey!

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:27.925
This is a lot for one person, don't you think?

00:17:28.655 --> 00:17:30.324
How did you know?

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:32.165
I do mukbang videos. Do you want to subscribe?

00:17:33.065 --> 00:17:36.035
Yes, just put them over there. Thank you.

00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:44.675
Thanks. Gosh, what a spread!

00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:47.005
Hey, what gives?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.345
Hey, you should've ordered some makguksu too.

00:17:50.575 --> 00:17:54.485
Seriously? You got jokbal but no makguksu? You have no taste.

00:17:58.585 --> 00:17:59.585
Why?

00:18:01.925 --> 00:18:03.495
Why are you so darn cheerful?

00:18:06.025 --> 00:18:07.795
Messing with that jerk is fun,

00:18:08.495 --> 00:18:11.065
- but it'll be okay, right? - No. You have to push him harder.

00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:12.465
Thank you.

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:15.105
Enough to make him contact Chief Choi.

00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:18.705
Then I guess I'll send him one more text.

I was planning to start a business in this field anyway.

Whatever. If you're so pissed, then come and find me.

- What was that? - But you'll never find me.

Why? Oh, right. You need to know where I am first.

You'll never, ever find me.

00:20:17.655 --> 00:20:18.765

00:26:37.035 --> 00:26:38.305
and you can get it all set up in no time.

00:26:39.145 --> 00:26:42.475
I can introduce you to all the pros. For real!

00:26:46.715 --> 00:26:48.814
Does it not occur to you that you should apologize...

00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:50.955
to the victims who suffered damage from you?

00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:52.355
No, wait, that's not...

00:26:54.025 --> 00:26:58.255
That just goes to show you what a sweet deal this is.

00:26:59.765 --> 00:27:01.995
Listen. They say...

00:27:03.495 --> 00:27:05.765
everyone gets three big breaks in life.

00:27:09.505 --> 00:27:11.735
This is one of yours right now.

00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:21.215
A package just arrived. I requested an AS.

00:27:21.545 --> 00:27:24.255
Once you see what's in there, you'll understand what I mean.

00:27:25.085 --> 00:27:26.085
AS?

00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:28.755
Hey, come on.

00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.395
I'll go get it and show you myself.

00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:34.695
Don't get me wrong.

00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:37.435
I'm not trying to run away. Trust me.

00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:43.605
(After Service)

00:27:50.815 --> 00:27:52.515
See? What did I tell you?

00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:54.645
Look.

00:27:55.555 --> 00:27:59.185
The pros take care of everything. I'm telling you.

00:27:59.955 --> 00:28:01.085
Isn't this a gold mine?

00:28:01.655 --> 00:28:03.425
(After Service)

00:28:06.165 --> 00:28:08.265
After service.

00:28:24.575 --> 00:28:25.585
Wait a minute.

00:28:27.515 --> 00:28:28.655
I don't think you should open that.

00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:30.685
It's fine, I'm telling you.

00:28:32.525 --> 00:28:34.985
This is how our system works.

00:28:44.295 --> 00:28:46.335
- It's a power bank. - Don't pick it up!

00:29:30.015 --> 00:29:31.715
Hey! Stay with me.

00:30:10.215 --> 00:30:12.425
I'm glad you're not seriously hurt.

00:30:13.185 --> 00:30:14.255
I know.

00:30:14.325 --> 00:30:16.195
Driver Kim, that was way too close.

00:30:17.095 --> 00:30:19.095
I'm fine. I just got lucky.

00:30:20.565 --> 00:30:24.165
The news just reported it as a death from an exploding power bank.

00:30:24.935 --> 00:30:27.965
- So, is this case closed then? - No.

00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:30.735
There's still more we need to find out.

00:30:31.605 --> 00:30:33.405
Haven't you ever wanted to get into this line of work?

00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:35.475
All you need is a little seed money,

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:37.175
and you can get it all set up in no time.

00:30:37.845 --> 00:30:41.185
I can introduce you to all the pros. For real!

00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:43.485
I thought that was strange too.

00:30:43.785 --> 00:30:47.985
I was wondering how a 23-year-old, fresh out of the military,

00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.955
could set up such a sophisticated criminal enterprise.

00:30:51.025 --> 00:30:53.325
I know. When we met him,

00:30:53.395 --> 00:30:56.065
he didn't seem like he could set up a burner phone properly.

00:30:56.395 --> 00:31:00.035
I think he paid the seed money and had all the supplies delivered.

00:31:01.835 --> 00:31:05.505
A package just arrived. I requested an AS.

00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:08.475
Once you see what's in there, you'll understand what I mean.

00:31:09.045 --> 00:31:10.745
In the end, that AS turned out to be...

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:14.715
a way to eliminate him.

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:18.155
A suspicious AS request,

00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:21.085
a strange package,

00:31:22.055 --> 00:31:25.565
and the seafood truck that delivered it.

00:31:27.795 --> 00:31:29.835
There are people out there running a business...

00:31:31.895 --> 00:31:33.435
that caters to aspiring criminals.

00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:43.515
I'll go through the data again and see if I can find any leads.

00:32:22.885 --> 00:32:25.855
(Welcome to Samheung Island.)

00:32:35.795 --> 00:32:37.595
(Police)

00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:38.805
You're back early.

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:40.165
(Police)

00:32:40.235 --> 00:32:41.705
Was the auction a bust?

00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:47.145
Gosh.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:51.375
When I ask you something, answer me. Even a short one.

00:32:52.415 --> 00:32:55.755
Just staring at me in silence makes you look suspicious.

00:32:57.155 --> 00:32:59.025
Gosh. Am I talking to myself here?

00:33:00.025 --> 00:33:01.055
Go on.

00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:08.625
(Police)

00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:12.265
He's so uptight.

00:33:12.735 --> 00:33:13.735
Hey!

00:33:16.805 --> 00:33:18.275
Nice day.

00:34:00.915 --> 00:34:03.115
The waves

00:34:03.785 --> 00:34:05.825
And the water

00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:09.825
The sea of women

00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:29.575
I reviewed all the data we've gathered,

00:34:30.145 --> 00:34:32.115
and there was nothing unusual.

00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:33.415
Really?

00:34:33.945 --> 00:34:38.255
Judging by your tone, it feels like there's more to it.

00:34:38.755 --> 00:34:41.855
But I did find something suspicious.

00:34:42.185 --> 00:34:43.995
What's the difference between "unusual" and "suspicious"?

00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:47.195
First,

00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:50.795
I tracked the fish truck by the plate that Driver Kim gave us.

00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:52.235
(Vehicle Registration)

00:34:52.335 --> 00:34:54.405
It's registered to a seafood restaurant on Samheung Island.

00:34:55.535 --> 00:34:58.405
That's the island at the north tip, right?

00:34:58.635 --> 00:35:01.345
Samheung Island. I've never even heard of it.

00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:02.775
You could probably see North Korea from there.

00:35:03.175 --> 00:35:06.785
And there's one more thing. It was in that jerk's things.

00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:09.155
A Lotus Lantern Number Tag he got for hanging a lantern at a temple.

00:35:09.455 --> 00:35:10.615
A Lotus Lantern Number Tag?

00:35:11.385 --> 00:35:15.125
It's not unusual to hang a lantern to make a wish.

00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:16.295
But...

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:20.525
the temple where he paid good money for a lantern just happens to be...

00:35:22.965 --> 00:35:24.295
Samheung Temple.

00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:27.535
You're right.

00:35:28.405 --> 00:35:30.875
It's not unusual, but it's definitely suspicious.

00:35:32.445 --> 00:35:35.245
There's no bridge to the island, so you have to take a boat.

00:35:37.875 --> 00:35:39.845
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:41.315
How about we go fishing? It's been a while.

00:35:45.185 --> 00:35:46.185
Fishing? Sounds great.

00:36:00.165 --> 00:36:03.335
We came all this way to fish and even rented a Deluxe Taxi.

00:36:03.735 --> 00:36:06.175
We'd better catch a big one.

00:36:11.415 --> 00:36:12.445
Here we are.

00:36:13.015 --> 00:36:14.085
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:36:16.555 --> 00:36:19.155
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:36:36.305 --> 00:36:38.305
(Police)

00:36:45.475 --> 00:36:46.915
What do you know? I didn't expect to see a taxi out here.

00:36:50.015 --> 00:36:51.615
(Samheung Beach)

00:37:17.645 --> 00:37:18.745
It's locked.

00:37:18.815 --> 00:37:20.285
(Welcome to Samheung Inn)

00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:38.035
(Samheung Inn)

00:37:38.095 --> 00:37:40.065
(Front Desk)

00:38:00.555 --> 00:38:02.155
(Samheung Inn)

00:38:02.225 --> 00:38:03.495
(Front Desk)

00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:09.665
Excuse us. The door was locked.

00:38:10.295 --> 00:38:11.295
Here to fish?

00:38:11.465 --> 00:38:14.065
Yes. We thought we'd stay a few days and find some good spots.

00:38:14.135 --> 00:38:15.875
Know any good spots around here?

00:38:18.775 --> 00:38:20.105
You came in a taxi?

00:38:21.705 --> 00:38:25.015
We knew there wasn't much out here, so we just hired one for the trip.

00:38:25.575 --> 00:38:29.585
You're the first guests I've had come here in a taxi to go fishing.

00:38:30.755 --> 00:38:31.815
Here you go.

00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:34.825
So, about the payment...

00:38:34.955 --> 00:38:36.394
You can pay when you check out.

00:38:36.395 --> 00:38:38.195
Just leave the key at the counter when you go out.

00:38:38.255 --> 00:38:39.325
Your room's that way.

00:38:41.665 --> 00:38:42.665
Okay.

00:38:43.235 --> 00:38:44.235
Thank you.

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:50.335
(Samheung Inn: Fully Equipped)

00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:52.705
(Welcome)

00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:54.575
She's not exactly the welcoming type.

00:38:56.515 --> 00:38:58.975
Let's just drop off our stuff and head right to Samheung Temple.

00:38:59.285 --> 00:39:00.285
Okay.

00:39:15.795 --> 00:39:17.795
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:39:19.335 --> 00:39:20.335
Goodness.

00:39:21.805 --> 00:39:23.035
This is quite a climb.

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:28.405
Even for the most devout Buddhist,

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:33.545
isn't it strange to come so far just to hang one lantern?

00:39:34.645 --> 00:39:35.715
Let's go up and see.

00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:37.185
Okay.

00:39:41.525 --> 00:39:43.525
(Samheung Temple)

00:40:06.885 --> 00:40:08.015
Hello?

00:40:13.155 --> 00:40:14.355
Is anyone here?

00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:00.935
They're supposed to be wish lanterns,

00:41:02.165 --> 00:41:05.235
but they look just like a giant accounting ledger.

00:41:06.145 --> 00:41:07.145
An accounting ledger?

00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:10.845
They're all in the same format. Name, date,

00:41:11.275 --> 00:41:14.345
- and the numbers at the bottom... - What do you think you're doing?

00:41:26.665 --> 00:41:28.695
We received a trespassing complaint.

00:41:29.565 --> 00:41:30.565
A complaint?

00:41:30.895 --> 00:41:31.895
That's right.

00:41:33.505 --> 00:41:37.675
They said some rats were scurrying around as if they owned the place.

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:45.345
I guess this is private property. We had no idea.

00:41:47.145 --> 00:41:48.145
But...

00:41:49.145 --> 00:41:51.685
fishermen don't usually come this far up.

00:41:53.725 --> 00:41:54.755
You know,

00:41:55.055 --> 00:41:58.995
fishing's so popular these days, it's packed everywhere.

00:41:59.525 --> 00:42:01.425
We were looking for a quieter spot,

00:42:01.695 --> 00:42:02.995
and we ended up all the way out here.

00:42:03.735 --> 00:42:06.905
But how did you know we were here to go fishing?

00:42:15.805 --> 00:42:17.875
You're dressed for it.

00:42:19.615 --> 00:42:20.615
So,

00:42:21.215 --> 00:42:23.555
why come here instead of going fishing?

00:42:24.885 --> 00:42:29.025
It's not high tide, so we had time to kill and decided to look around.

00:42:31.455 --> 00:42:34.525
A young guy like you knows about the West Sea's tides?

00:42:37.695 --> 00:42:39.465
Anyway,

00:42:40.365 --> 00:42:41.465
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

00:42:42.465 --> 00:42:44.075
Before this gets any more out of hand,

00:42:44.405 --> 00:42:45.505
let's get out of here.

00:42:45.775 --> 00:42:46.775
Yes, Mr. Jang.

00:43:03.595 --> 00:43:05.755
(Samheung Temple)

00:43:05.825 --> 00:43:08.725
No matter how I think about it, something's fishy about that temple.

00:43:09.765 --> 00:43:11.965
And that cop who kicked us out was shady too.

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:16.235
I think that's the most suspicious part.

00:43:27.715 --> 00:43:30.655
They can't be delivering fish to a Buddhist temple.

00:43:31.715 --> 00:43:33.625
Or maybe this isn't a temple at all.

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:37.695
Excuse me? Driver?

00:43:38.925 --> 00:43:39.995
Oh, hello

00:43:40.525 --> 00:43:42.525
You weren't here, so I let myself in.

00:43:43.165 --> 00:43:46.635
I was hoping you'd give me a lift on your way down.

00:43:47.335 --> 00:43:49.065
I've got a lot of stuff with me.

00:43:49.735 --> 00:43:52.175
Besides, this is the only road down from here,

00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.075
so it's not like you're going out of your way.

00:43:55.775 --> 00:43:57.245
I'll pay for half the fare.

00:43:58.145 --> 00:43:59.145
What do you say?

00:43:59.745 --> 00:44:04.655
I'd really appreciate it. It's a long walk down otherwise.

00:44:06.285 --> 00:44:10.325
I don't mind. Let's give him a ride, driver.

00:44:11.325 --> 00:44:12.325
Yes, sir.

00:44:12.555 --> 00:44:14.365
The driver...

00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:17.295
is pretty young. Thank you.

00:44:34.545 --> 00:44:37.685
So, I've been staying here for about two weeks now,

00:44:37.755 --> 00:44:39.585
and you're the first outsiders I've seen.

00:44:39.655 --> 00:44:41.985
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:44:42.025 --> 00:44:44.295
So, driver, you came here with him?

00:44:45.325 --> 00:44:46.395
Yes.

00:44:49.765 --> 00:44:51.495
I see you're into photography.

00:44:53.165 --> 00:44:54.905
Well, it's more than just a hobby.

00:44:55.665 --> 00:44:57.775
I'm a professional photographer.

00:44:58.475 --> 00:45:00.575
Oh, you're a photographer.

00:45:01.245 --> 00:45:03.775
But is there anything worth shooting here?

00:45:06.115 --> 00:45:07.745
The sunset glows...

00:45:07.815 --> 00:45:09.555
are really something else on this island.

00:45:10.255 --> 00:45:12.255
It's way more intense than anywhere else,

00:45:12.315 --> 00:45:15.385
and the afterglow lingers for a really long time.

00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:20.265
So I've been all over the island taking photos.

00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:22.225
I see.

00:45:23.235 --> 00:45:25.735
Gosh, we got here so fast by car.

00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:27.665
Thanks for the nice, comfortable ride.

00:45:27.735 --> 00:45:31.435
You can just let me out right up ahead.

00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:33.105
Sure.

00:45:44.055 --> 00:45:47.125
But don't you think it's a little strange?

00:45:49.185 --> 00:45:50.555
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:45:50.995 --> 00:45:52.355
The people here on the island.

00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:55.295
Don't you find them a little odd?

00:45:56.595 --> 00:45:57.835
How can I put this?

00:45:59.605 --> 00:46:01.865
It's they lack the human touch.

00:46:07.845 --> 00:46:10.545
But hey, that's actually better for my art.

00:46:11.645 --> 00:46:12.745
Anyway, thanks again.

00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:17.785
And good luck with the fishing!

00:46:27.825 --> 00:46:31.535
Seems like everyone we meet knows we're here to go fishing.

00:46:33.565 --> 00:46:35.165
And he didn't even pay the fare.

00:46:42.575 --> 00:46:46.645
(Samheung Beach)

00:46:46.945 --> 00:46:49.585
(Samheung Inn)

00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:57.195
I'm going to go get the key.

00:46:57.255 --> 00:46:59.795
- I'll get our stuff. - Got it.

00:47:03.835 --> 00:47:06.305
(Samheung Inn)

00:47:15.105 --> 00:47:17.575
(Front desk)

00:47:32.925 --> 00:47:34.465
It was locked again?

00:47:34.765 --> 00:47:36.964
I just grabbed one. She wouldn't say anything, would she?

00:47:36.965 --> 00:47:37.995
No, it'll be fine.

00:47:38.265 --> 00:47:40.165
- Let me get that. - Thanks.

00:47:43.735 --> 00:47:45.875
You know, I was thinking.

00:47:46.845 --> 00:47:48.945
I think your point is valid.

00:47:49.245 --> 00:47:53.045
You said they could be using the Great Hall as their ledger.

00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:56.655
We should probably go back tomorrow and take another look.

00:47:57.555 --> 00:48:00.655
We should probably meet with the head monk again too.

00:48:02.225 --> 00:48:03.295
Hold on a second.

00:48:04.655 --> 00:48:05.695
What is this?

00:49:25.305 --> 00:49:27.075
So you're back from fishing.

00:49:31.015 --> 00:49:32.045
But you didn't catch a thing.

00:49:46.355 --> 00:49:47.725
I was hoping to buy some fish off you.

00:50:09.915 --> 00:50:11.585
(Samheung Inn)

00:50:11.985 --> 00:50:15.755
I don't see what the big deal is. He was just trying to buy some fish.

00:50:15.825 --> 00:50:17.655
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

00:50:17.795 --> 00:50:21.694
It's your fault you caught no fish. How is that the buyer's fault?

00:50:21.695 --> 00:50:22.965
Hey, excuse me, ma'am.

00:50:24.035 --> 00:50:25.635
Maybe you'll catch some tomorrow.

00:50:27.005 --> 00:50:28.235
Since you're here to fish and all.

00:50:30.405 --> 00:50:31.474
Hey, wait a minute.

00:50:31.475 --> 00:50:32.835
(Welcome)

00:50:33.105 --> 00:50:34.105
Ma'am!

00:50:35.005 --> 00:50:36.105
I can't believe what you're saying.

00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:39.715
Sir, let's just go.

00:50:49.355 --> 00:50:53.225
She should at least apologize for letting him in without asking.

00:50:53.295 --> 00:50:56.635
Isn't that the least she could do? It's just common sense.

00:50:57.095 --> 00:50:59.495
I know. They somehow make it seem like we're the ones in the wrong.

00:51:00.235 --> 00:51:04.535
We'd better lock the door tight. How am I meant to sleep like this?

00:51:05.035 --> 00:51:07.645
They won't come back, will they? We didn't even catch any fish.

00:51:08.945 --> 00:51:12.415
- Or not? Are we the fish? - Unbelievable.

00:51:17.555 --> 00:51:19.085
What is it? Did you see something?

00:51:26.195 --> 00:51:27.365
It's nothing, sir.

00:51:28.525 --> 00:51:29.595
Let's get going.

00:51:29.995 --> 00:51:30.995
Okay.

00:51:54.625 --> 00:51:57.895
You'd better catch a lot of fish today.

00:51:58.225 --> 00:51:59.355
That's the plan.

00:51:59.655 --> 00:52:01.425
Any luck with what I asked you to look up?

00:52:01.695 --> 00:52:04.495
His real name is Kim Woo Jong. He's 23.

00:52:04.595 --> 00:52:06.904
Records show he went to Cambodia at 19...

00:52:06.905 --> 00:52:08.635
and returned one and a half years later.

00:52:08.935 --> 00:52:10.875
But I did find something strange.

00:52:11.875 --> 00:52:12.935
Something strange?

00:52:13.605 --> 00:52:15.904
While checking his criminal record,

00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:18.415
I found he visited a prison once.

00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:22.015
And guess who it was?

00:52:23.715 --> 00:52:27.525
Lee Gi Hyeon, ringleader of the Cambodian Mango Plantation scam.

00:52:27.855 --> 00:52:29.124
He was caught two and a half years ago...

00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:30.395
and is currently serving time.

00:52:30.595 --> 00:52:33.625
So Lee Gi Hyeon is the ringleader of the Mango Plantation scam,

00:52:33.965 --> 00:52:36.595
and that Kim Woo Jong guy has a record of entering Cambodia.

00:52:36.965 --> 00:52:38.165
And he went to visit him in prison.

00:52:38.535 --> 00:52:41.565
That's how a kid barely in his 20s was able to set up...

00:52:41.635 --> 00:52:44.405
a professional criminal operation.

00:52:45.075 --> 00:52:46.645
How are things on your end, Driver Kim?

00:52:47.175 --> 00:52:48.175
Over here?

00:52:49.275 --> 00:52:51.515
The people here are a bit unfriendly.

00:52:51.945 --> 00:52:53.215
Unfriendly?

00:52:53.885 --> 00:52:54.885
Wait a second.

00:53:03.055 --> 00:53:05.995
The fish truck and the photographer are heading for the mainland.

00:53:06.665 --> 00:53:07.665
Go Eun.

00:53:07.725 --> 00:53:11.135
Got it. We'll tail them once they get to the mainland.

00:53:11.565 --> 00:53:12.565
All right.

00:53:16.835 --> 00:53:19.135
What? A police car too.

00:53:20.905 --> 00:53:22.745
This means the coast is clear.

00:53:26.015 --> 00:53:30.255
Do Gi, shouldn't you go now to check for that ledger you mentioned?

00:53:30.455 --> 00:53:34.125
I guess that means you'll have to go fishing by yourself, Mr. Jang.

00:53:35.125 --> 00:53:37.325
All right, everyone, let's get moving.

00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:38.695
- Yes! - Yes!

00:54:03.085 --> 00:54:05.285
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:54:18.165 --> 00:54:23.775
(Service in session, no entry, Head Monk of Samheung Temple)

00:55:35.175 --> 00:55:36.975
So they were watching everything from here.

00:55:44.815 --> 00:55:46.985
(Employee Manual)

00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:31.695
(Alumni Association of Auditors, Judicial Research and Training Inst)

00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:44.815
Mister!

00:56:45.115 --> 00:56:46.345
Da Som!

00:56:49.715 --> 00:56:52.385
- How have you been? - Good. How about you?

00:56:52.515 --> 00:56:54.355
I've been good too.

00:56:54.785 --> 00:56:58.725
I came to ask you something.

00:56:59.095 --> 00:57:00.425
What is it?

00:57:01.065 --> 00:57:03.594
The gift you wanted to get your dad...

00:57:03.595 --> 00:57:04.795
Gloves.

00:57:05.365 --> 00:57:06.935
That's right. Gloves.

00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:09.505
- Leather gloves. - Right, leather gloves.

00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:11.805
Were they black?

00:57:12.105 --> 00:57:14.475
Yes, that's right. Black leather gloves.

00:57:15.405 --> 00:57:17.075
By any chance,

00:57:19.175 --> 00:57:20.245
do they look like these?

00:57:22.615 --> 00:57:25.255
That's them! These are the ones!

00:57:26.255 --> 00:57:29.485
Thank you. Thank you so much, my hero!

00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:34.295
- Dad! - Da Som.

00:57:36.825 --> 00:57:40.135
I knew you'd help us.

00:57:44.905 --> 00:57:46.405
You're so amazing.

00:57:47.975 --> 00:57:48.975
Thanks.

00:57:50.845 --> 00:57:52.175
A present for you, Dad.

00:57:52.875 --> 00:57:56.345
The doctor said you have to keep your hands warm, so I bought them.

00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:58.185
Where did you get these?

00:57:58.515 --> 00:57:59.615
From my hero.

00:57:59.885 --> 00:58:01.325
Your hero?

00:58:09.265 --> 00:58:11.165
You don't like the candy?

00:58:12.365 --> 00:58:13.835
No, it's sweet.

00:58:14.505 --> 00:58:16.065
Then why are you crying?

00:58:20.745 --> 00:58:22.375
You'll understand when you're older, Maria.

00:58:23.575 --> 00:58:24.745
You just will.

You seven, head to the airport right now.

00:59:35.645 --> 00:59:39.755
With seed money, we can make a killing. Help us out.

00:59:39.955 --> 00:59:42.925
Mister, weren't you here to go fishing?

00:59:43.385 --> 00:59:45.195
What are we going to do about the guys from the taxi company?

00:59:45.395 --> 00:59:47.565
Why don't we just take them all out?

00:59:47.725 --> 00:59:50.595
Go Eun, can you hear me? Go Eun?

00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:53.835
Why did people end up dead or missing...

00:59:54.005 --> 00:59:56.035
in the places you've passed by?

00:59:56.565 --> 00:59:59.775
Why were you the only one who made it out alive?
