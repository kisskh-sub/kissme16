00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:30.322
Now, let us begin the Ace Match.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.829
Go get him. Good luck on the Ace Match.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.124
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.126
You've got this, A-in!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.295
Thanks.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.969
Today's Ace Match is

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.304
Three-way Divide.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.681
I wonder what this is.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.433
- Three-way split is Tae-hun's thing.
- Of course.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.310
A 3-WAY SPLIT ROUTINE
Push-pull-legs.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.732
In Three-way Divide,
you will be given Hangul consonants

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:08.694
to make 3 words representing 3 numbers.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:12.990
The sum of the three numbers
must match the target number.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.200
And they can make three numbers only?

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.661
Just three?
That's why it's called Three-way Divide.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.872
- That sounds amazing!
- The game involves Hangul.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:22.541
This should be fun.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.211
When the game begins,
a target number will be revealed.

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:30.090
The two contestants must use
the given deck of Hangul consonant cards

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:34.928
to make three numbers
whose sum matches the target number.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:40.183
Their answer must involve all the cards,
with none remaining.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.979
- "With none remaining"?
- No leftovers? That's rough.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:48.984
The numbers the cards can represent
are based on the Sino-Korean numbers.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.279
Let us consider the card with ieung.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:57.034
You can only use it
to represent 1, 2, 5, or 6.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:03.123
It alone cannot be used
to represent 0, 10, 100, or 1000.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.960
The numbers that giyeok, bieup, siot,
chieut, and pieup can represent

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.629
are as follows.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.672
GIYEOK: 9, BIEUP: 100S, SIOT: 3, 4, 10S,
CHIEUT: 7, 1000S, PIEUP: 8

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:15.719
Pieup, giyeok, and bieup are fixed
as 8, 9, and multiples of 100 each.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.056
- So we can't represent zero?
- No.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.892
The contestant
with the target number's combination

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:26.104
must name their 3 numbers
in under 30 seconds.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.399
If your answer is correct,
you will win one point.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:34.488
If not, your opponent will be given
20 seconds to answer.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.992
- That 20-second window is a big threat.
- Tell me about it.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.745
- It looks fun to me.
- To me, too.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.206
- It's so original.
- I agree.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.250
Three-way Divide is a best-of-five game.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.169
The winner of the Ace Match

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.963
will be awarded a benefit
to be used in the upcoming main match.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.799
Let's win this, STEM Division.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.468
- Medical Division has beaten us so far.
- Yeah.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.387
- I bet A-in will do great.
- Sure.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.972
You will be given ten minutes
to strategize.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:04.184
You can select one contestant
in your division

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.478
to discuss strategies with.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.314
Please name one contestant
from your division

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.358
to discuss your strategy with.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.320
I'll go with Team Yonsei's Park Sang-yeon.

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:20.242
I found his strategies on Day 1
very creative and helpful.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:24.287
My choice is
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.083
I went with Dong-geon for his experience
in mathematics as a math major

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.544
and his strategic mind.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.631
Team Yonsei's Park Sang-yeon

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:39.803
and Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon,
please come to the Main Hall.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.097
- Look.
- Okay.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.641
I found the optimal strategy for this.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.394
- Look...
- I knew I could count on you.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.980
You'll be given ten minutes.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.276
First things first.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.611
Break down the target number.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:00.449
Approach the target number by each digit
and combine your findings for the answer.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.076
We thought that it was more efficient

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.205
to start from the thousands place
and tackle the others in descending order.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.542
Consider 2500 and 3700, for example.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.961
Sum them up, and you get 6200.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.006
But you can get the same result
by adding 2700 and 3500.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.301
So you can build the answers
after the digit-by-digit analysis is done.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:23.305
Basically, I should break things down
by the digit from the start?

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:26.850
Yes, that's the best strategy.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.602
The number of the cards matters.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.562
Check if it's odd or even-numbered.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:35.650
Numbers 1,000, 100, and 10
only require a single card each.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.571
But numbers like 2,000 or 3,000
require two cards.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.573
In other words, even-numbered cards.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:46.119
In this sample question, we have 11 cards.

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:48.413
So one of the numbers
has odd-numbered cards.

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.123
ONE NUMBER HAS ODD-NUMBERED CARDS

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.251
Here's your strategy.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.878
Count the number of chieut

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.506
and decide whether you'll use them
for multiples of 1,000 or 7.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.966
- Initially, yes. That's my priority.
- Exactly.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.055
As the consonant chieut can be used
for either 7 or multiples of 1,000,

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:10.101
it has the widest gap between
representable numbers among all the cards.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.979
Since that is the case,

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.650
it is crucial that you correctly decide
how to use the card.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.985
It'd be better to divide
the target number into two,

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.362
considering the bieup cards.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.906
Oh, you're absolutely right.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.493
The bieup cards could only be used
for the multiples of 100.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:31.665
So our approach was to break down
the target number into two chunks.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.166
It could be easier

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.336
to build numbers for the first 2 digits
and then the last 2 digits.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.172
- Will they be allowed to take notes?
- I think so.

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:41.716
I doubt it. They'll probably
have to solve it mentally.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.469
- Would they have to solve it mentally?
- Of course.

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:46.471
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.182
Try cracking this.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.725
How would you build 2529?

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.105
TARGET NUMBER
2529

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.898
First off, 1,900.

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:57.983
Then, 500?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.068
- With 1900 and 500--
- If you use 1,900 and 500,

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.237
- you need 129.
- Right.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.323
We can get 129
with 3 ieung and 3 siot, right?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.450
With 64 and 65?

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.077
That's right.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.163
Your numbers can be 1964, 565, and 5.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.207
Good work.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.668
Okay, I've got this.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.837
Hey, you can beat him no problem.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.340
You flattened the STEM guy
in the Ace Selection, remember?

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.466
He took double the time.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.885
- Really?
- You bet.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.177
He did take a while.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.139
That's right.
Your odds of winning are really good.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.474
You'll do fine if you don't get nervous.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.560
I'm not nervous at all.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.479
I'll do my best to end it in three rounds.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.273
I badly want Myeong-su to win.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.275
Please let him win.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.985
Oh, Myeong-su.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.154
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:45.280
Good luck!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.576
You feel good, right? Go crush him, A-in.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.119
You bet I will.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.245
ACE SELECTION
3-WAY DIVIDE

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:02.255
I told myself I had to win the game
and secure the benefit for my division.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.259
I did far better than Myeong-su
in the Ace Selection.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.804
Since I got off to a good start,
I wanted to flatten him.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.974
We will now begin the Ace Match,
Three-way Divide.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.227
- This is going to be so much fun.
- Let's go.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.104
Here we go, Three-way Divide.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.231
I can't wait to see their strategies.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.860
Here are your consonant cards for Round 1.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.159
2 IEUNG, 3 SIOT,
1 CHIEUT, 1 PIEUP, 1 GIYEOK, 1 BIEUP

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.247
Let's give it a try.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.167
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 1.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.127
TARGET NUMBER
3943

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.554
IEUNG AND CHIEUT FOR 2000
GIYEOK AND BIEUP FOR 900

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:58.937
Team SNU's Song Myeong-su.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.314
He hit the buzzer already.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:02.482
He's really fast.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.567
- That only took him 10 to 15 seconds.
- That fast?

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.361
What are your numbers?

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:10.532
They are 3000, 915, and 28.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.492
- Did the target number end with 43?
- Yes.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.869
He got it right, then.
Wow, how is he so fast?

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.622
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.582
You won one point.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.334
SONG MYEONG-SU: 1, CHOI A-IN: 0

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:31.094
I'm impressed by Myeong-su.
He's much better in the actual game.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.596
Dang, this is the true worth of Myeong-su.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.599
Check this out
Song Myeong-su rolling out

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.686
That's an inhuman speed. It's outrageous.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.062
He's good, isn't he?

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.815
The experience of playing
and winning Round 1

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.901
gave me the confidence
that I could win easily.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.030
Here are your consonant cards for Round 2.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:56.161
4 IEUNG, 3 SIOT,
2 CHIEUT, 1 BIEUP, 1 GIYEOK

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:57.829
They got a lot to work with.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.123
Hey, look at all those ieung.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.876
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 2.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.712
TARGET NUMBER
5151

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:15.430
SONG MYEONG-SU USED ALL CHIEUT
TO BUILD MULTIPLES OF 1,000

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:20.060
CHOI A-IN USED ONLY 1 CHIEUT
TO MAKE 1 MULTIPLE OF 1,000

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.565
We're counting on you, Myeong-su.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.240
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
What are your numbers?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.209
They are 3022...

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.086
SIOT, CHIEUT, IEUNG, IEUNG, IEUNG FOR 3022

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.254
...2109, and 30.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.757
Guys, what are we to make
of the trio of ieung?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.467
Triple ieung won't do, right?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.885
That is incorrect.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.811
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in
will now be given 20 seconds.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.772
It could work if he swaps
the ieung and the siot.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.316
Yes, he only needs to swap those two.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.069
IF MYEONG-SU SWITCHES
THE HIGHLIGHTED TWO CARDS

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.445
3022, 2109, 20

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:16.533
THE SUM OF THE NEW 3 NUMBERS
MATCHES THE TARGET NUMBER

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.956
You have ten seconds left.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.254
You have five seconds left.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.588
Just five seconds.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.132
Oh, please...

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.135
Come on, A-in. You've got this.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.596
Your time is up.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:45.436
SWITCHES THE SIOT CARD AND THE IEUNG CARD

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.981
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.610
There we have it.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:57.574
My numbers are 3022, 2109, and 20.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.287
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.538
SONG MYEONG-SU: 2, CHOI A-IN: 0

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.123
I will now collect your cards.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.625
Wow, he's damn good.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.002
Myeong-su!

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.795
I'm getting a rush of dopamine.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.381
Isn't this our team's
first good performance on the show?

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.049
Tell me about it.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.886
All right.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.347
Sir Myeong-su!

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.057
The tide had turned in my favor.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.519
So I wanted to finish the game
with three consecutive wins.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.105
Please get us a 3-0 victory. Come on!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.940
You can do this, A-in!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.359
Don't get discouraged, A-in!

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.946
I thought, "Others might suffer
a breakdown at this point,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.990
but I never fall apart."

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.160
Here are your consonant cards for Round 3.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.919
3 BIEUP, 4 SIOT,
4 IEUNG, 1 CHIEUT, 1 PIEUP

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.880
What's with all these siot and ieung?

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.423
They must make 3 multiples of 100.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.884
That means all numbers
must be 100 or bigger.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.720
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 3.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.472
TARGET NUMBER
1272

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.650
USING THE CHIEUT FOR 7
INSTEAD OF A MULTIPLE OF 1000

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:18.196
AFTER BUILDING 700
USING THE CHIEUT AND A BIEUP

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.823
HE SWAPS THE CHIEUT WITH THE PIEUP
TO GET 800 INSTEAD

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.785
- He needs either 800 or 700.
- That's right.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.453
I'd try 800, 200, and 200.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:26.788
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.331
Or 700, 300, and 200.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.424
MYEONG-SU'S 3 NUMBERS
SUM UP TO THE TARGET NUMBER

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.803
BUT HE HAS ONE SIOT CARD REMAINING

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.603
I knew my initial approach had an error,
but I just couldn't think straight.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.356
I kept racking my brain,
but I had no luck.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:01.114
If A-in loses again,
Myeong-su wins the match.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.701
CHOI A-IN MUST WIN THIS ROUND

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.455
A-in, hit the buzzer first
and review the numbers later.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:10.957
Hit it.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.500
- Come on.
- Hit it already.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.586
You've got to try your luck.
It's time you gambled.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.676
Hey, she did it.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.265
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.
What are your three numbers?

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:35.398
They are 252, 740, and 280.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.154
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in. That is correct.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.405
SONG MYEONG-SU: 2, CHOI A-IN: 1

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.906
I will now collect your cards.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.870
All right, A-in!

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.955
Way to go, A-in!

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.919
Our cheers are louder
than the STEM guys' cheers.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.297
Wait, Team POSTECH went home.

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:07.221
I thought, "That's more like it.
I have it in me to demonstrate my skills."

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.851
Here are your consonant cards for Round 4.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.443
2 BIEUP, 5 SIOT,
3 IEUNG, 2 CHIEUT, 2 PIEUP

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.987
That's crazy. They got five siot?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.530
Why are there so many cards?

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.116
What's with all these cards?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.078
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 4.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.538
TARGET NUMBER
1987

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.667
BOTH SET THE CHIEUT ASIDE
TO USE IT TO REPRESENT 1000

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.256
CHOI A-IN'S CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS
SUM UP TO 1800

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.216
That's a good idea.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.051
Setting aside roughly 100 to 200

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:49.013
- for the sum of double-digit numbers.
- Totally.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.099
She's on a roll.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.479
Why did he put two ieung at the start?

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.189
Maybe that's for the better.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:01.442
Will he use 200 and 500 and compensate
for the rest with the 2-digit numbers?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.701
Hey, she's got it.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:11.953
She cracked it.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.457
1987, THE TARGET NUMBER

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.167
A-in is almost done.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.628
This isn't the time to double-check.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.507
- He has to swap the siot and the ieung.
- That should do it.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.718
Come on, Myeong-su. Hurry!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.264
BOTH PLAYERS ARE ON THE VERGE
OF GETTING A CORRECT ANSWER SET

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.230
Hit the buzzer.

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:40.815
- She has to.
- Go for it, A-in.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.858
Go on, A-in.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.320
SONG MYEONG-SU HIT THE BUZZER FIRST

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:49.615
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
What are your three numbers?

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.492
Myeong-su hit the buzzer first.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:54.912
My numbers are 1048...

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.956
CHIEUT, SIOT, SIOT, PIEUP FOR 1048

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.208
...587...

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.585
IEUNG, BIEUP, PIEUP, SIOT, CHIEUT FOR 587

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.003
...and 352.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.046
SIOT, BIEUP, IEUNG, SIOT, IEUNG FOR 352

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.175
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:13.055
SONG MYEONG-SU: 3, CHOI A-IN: 1

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.229
That was amazing.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.482
- He delivered!
- Oh, man.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.817
- Let's show them in the main match.
- Okay.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.195
She did great,
cracking the difficult Round 3.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.030
- I'm so glad Myeong-su won.
- I love it.

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.990
- We may avoid today's Deathmatch.
- Right.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.200
The tide is on our side.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.827
What a shame.
If this works in their favor,

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.120
today will be rough.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.872
We can defeat them in the main match.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.374
Let them take the benefit.
We'll crush them.

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.794
It felt great to demonstrate my skills.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.548
I also loved that I got to show the others
the strength of Team SNU in STEM.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.511
I want another face-off with Myeong-su.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.931
I'll defeat him then
and prove that I have the upper hand.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:59.602
That concludes the Ace Match,
Three-way Divide.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.481
Both contestants,
please return to your base camps.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.947
- Well done.
- Great job.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.114
It was so close.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.241
Shoot.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.243
That really ruined my mood.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.203
Hey, you aced the difficult Round 3.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.497
- It was so hard.
- It just wasn't your day.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.333
We can take them in the main match.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:26.295
We're sending them to the Deathmatch.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.049
You showed them, buddy!

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.176
- You were amazing.
- We knew you were going to win.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.177
I'm so relieved.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.806
We were so sure
that we didn't even fuss one bit.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.226
See for yourself
when the episode is released.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.852
DESPERATE
Come on, Myeong-su.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.396
I'm sure he got it right.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.606
EXCITED
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.693
DELIGHTED

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.696
EXHILARATED

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.448
We were so sure
that we didn't even fuss one bit.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.701
ACCORDING TO DONG-GEON,
THEY DIDN'T MAKE A FUSS

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.496
That benefit will hopefully keep us
out of the Deathmatch today.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.623
- I love it.
- Things are going as I planned.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.542
I'm hungry.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.752
Same here.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.505
- What are these?
- We've got snacks?

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.423
Let's have them.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.801
Quail eggs? We could use some protein.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.013
Can you find a tear notch?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.223
Hey, we don't even need scissors.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.517
- I've been feeling peckish.
- What a treat!

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.977
I'm starving.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:27.398
Sitting for long periods studying
can cause muscle loss.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.860
Don't forget to take enough protein
to remedy that.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.403
Are they different products?

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.947
This has 3 quail eggs, and that one has 5.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.033
Right, it's the perfect grab-and-go snack.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:42.955
Isn't it good?

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.166
- It's good.
- I love that we don't have to touch food.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.667
The eggs come out so easily.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.669
I often get this
from the convenience store.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.379
It's great for a quick snack.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:54.216
I used to have this a lot
when I was on a diet and felt peckish.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.469
I had a ton of these back in high school.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.597
- Can I have some more?
- Of course.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.307
- Would you like this one?
- Yes, please.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.516
I want the bigger portion.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.147
All contestants,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.652
please gather outside your base camps
for the main match.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.695
- Shall we, then?
- Let's go.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.864
Let's get out there first.

00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:20.618
- Let's go, Team KAIST.
- Good luck.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.537
It feels empty with no one across from us.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.414
You're right.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.334
We used to look at the POSTECH guys
and wish each other good luck.

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:31.337
Today's main match is...

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.005
I wonder what it will be.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.093
...Exit Strategy 3.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.469
MAIN MATCH
EXIT STRATEGY 3

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:43.015
THIS TEAM-BASED STRATEGY GAME
HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF ELITE LEAGUE

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.519
WE HAVE THE ALL-NEW EXIT STRATEGY 3

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.022
- Hang on.
- Is this for real?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.649
- Exit Strategy.
- For real.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.067
I didn't see this coming.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.735
This won't be easy.

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:56.946
In Exit Strategy,

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:00.032
all contestants will act
as game pieces on the board.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:05.538
The division that has two people
exit the board first wins the game.

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:07.915
For Exit Strategy 3,

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.918
we're introducing a new term
that you can meet to win.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.047
Regardless of the exits,

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:19.927
the division that removes three people
on their opposing side wins the game.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.262
We're removing people?

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:23.013
We can remove a piece?

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:27.226
Each division
will have eight participants.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.771
Some of us have to stay out of it.

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.232
No exemptions for the STEM teams.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.736
Assign 2 members as the leaders
and the 6 others as the game pieces

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:39.196
before going into the game.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.201
The leaders will be given one minute
to choose which piece will make a move.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.621
The chosen piece
will also be given one minute

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.916
to travel in the direction they see fit.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.795
The pieces can only move
in a straight line

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:59.467
and must come to a stop
if they meet a piece or a wall.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:03.763
We are also introducing
a new role to Exit Strategy 3.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:09.602
One of the six game pieces
will be given the role of the hunter.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.188
What does the hunter do?

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:17.485
The hunters can only move
one square in one of the four directions.

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:22.323
They can capture their opponent's piece
should they run into one.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.995
The captured piece will be removed
from the board immediately.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.167
This sounds interesting.

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:38.672
I decided to build our strategy
with the hunter as the central figure.

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:42.259
Please note that the hunters
cannot capture each other.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:48.724
Also, they cannot move across the exit
or leave the board.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:53.020
The two leaders
must stay in their Division Room

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:56.232
while the remaining six pieces
must stay on the game board.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.777
There will be no communication
between the two separated groups.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.362
NO COMMUNICATION ALLOWED

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.739
Once the game begins,

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.408
only the leaders
can communicate with each other,

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.619
while the pieces must stay silent.

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:13.123
Aside from the middle row and column,

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:17.086
you can place the five numbered pieces
in your camp freely.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.171
On the other hand,

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:23.008
the hunter can only be placed
on one of the yellow squares in your camp.

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.428
You can request
up to two timeouts per round,

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:31.141
once by the leaders
and once by the hunter.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:32.852
Out of a total of three rounds,

00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:35.604
the division that secures two wins first
will be declared the winner.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:39.441
The teams of the losing division
will compete in the Deathmatch.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.444
If they lose,
all three teams get the Deathmatch.

00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:45.030
- We have three teams.
- All three must be competing.

00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:46.448
Medical Division

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:50.160
must select 8 contestants out of 12
as the participants.

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:53.455
The excluded four contestants
cannot join their division during timeouts

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:56.750
or substitute the participants.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.836
Not at all?

00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:01.589
So the four people are basically excluded.

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.632
Those four will have nothing to do.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.801
All they can do is watch the game.

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.555
The benefit of this match
will now be revealed.

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:13.809
The team with the benefit
will decide which division goes first.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:16.353
- Not bad.
- It's great.

00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:18.188
I felt a surge of pride

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:21.942
thinking that the benefit I secured
would be a great help to my division.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:27.448
As the winner of today's Ace Match,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.660
Team SNU in STEM will decide
whether to go first or second.

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:35.205
TRICKSTER
Won't going second be more advantageous?

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:36.874
What are we thinking?

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:37.791
Shouldn't we...

00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:40.419
I think we should go first
and place the hunter in the center.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:41.337
I agree.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.923
It's better to go first
in turn-based games.

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:44.840
That's true.

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:47.885
All we had to do was
get two pieces exit the board first.

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.845
So going first seemed advantageous.

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:50.763
STEM DIVISION WILL GO FIRST

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.849
Medical Division,
please go to your Division Room

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.810
and decide on the eight contestants
to participate in the game.

00:23:56.894 --> 00:24:00.147
You'll be given five minutes.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.151
We'll need to keep it brief
and reach a conclusion quickly.

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:07.446
Shouldn't everyone briefly pitch
their strategy--

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:11.450
- We don't have the time for that.
- We can't do that under five minutes.

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:12.743
Here's an idea.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:16.914
Each team can nominate one member
that they want to include in the roster.

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:19.291
We want to make sure
that Ji-hu is included.

00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:21.627
- He has to participate.
- Hands down.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.421
Why don't we each select
1 or 2 members to exclude?

00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:26.256
Yes, that's the right approach.

00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:30.427
If you are good with turn-based games,
I'll bow out. I'm not good with them.

00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:33.263
It should be me
if we have to exclude anyone.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:36.266
- I can sit this one out.
- Okay.

00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.979
THE FINAL NON-PARTICIPANT WILL BE DECIDED
BY A GAME OF ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:41.313
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:42.982
YONSEI, SKKU: ROCK
SNU IN MEDICINE: SCISSORS

00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:43.941
Who's also out?

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:45.526
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAN SEO-YEON

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.571
Both divisions,
please start discussing your strategies.

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:52.408
Exit Strategy 3 is very different
from Exit Strategy 2.

00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:56.829
In Exit Strategy 2, the game pieces
could roam the enemy territory freely.

00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:59.915
But in Exit Strategy 3,
the enemy hunter restricts our movement.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.917
- That's true.
- Since that's the case,

00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:05.004
we'll have to rely on our hunter
to make way for our pieces.

00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:08.507
The hunter's most important role
will be to act as a wall.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.094
The most important element
of Exit Strategy 3

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:14.138
are the two hunters.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.517
While the numbered pieces must continue on
until they meet an obstacle,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.270
the hunters can travel
toward their target,

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:24.606
moving one square at a time.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.568
The hunters' special ability allows them

00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:31.613
to serve as a wall for the others
in their course to exit the board.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.449
To use the hunter as our wall...

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.576
Check the column and the row
intersecting at the exit.

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:41.665
If we want to give the hunter
a defense-heavy role at the outset,

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:44.084
- our hunter should be here.
- Right.

00:25:44.168 --> 00:25:47.004
If STEM Division surrounds the exit
with pieces to use as their walls,

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.548
our hunter can eliminate them.

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.593
In case we need a wall,
the hunter can go here.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:56.263
They can be our stepping stone
as they can stop after moving one square.

00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:59.349
The hunter should be
on one of the corner cells to the exit.

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:02.311
- They should go there if possible.
- They must get there at all costs.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:05.856
Wouldn't STEM Division's hunter
also want the same corner cells?

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.649
STEM DIVISION ROOM
Here's what I think.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.819
The hunter should take
one of these four corner cells

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:14.156
because the hunter can then
easily take out the enemy's walls.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.240
SAME STRATEGY AS MEDICAL DIVISION

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:20.204
One concern about placing our hunter there
is that the opponent can sacrifice a piece

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.999
- to get another to leave the board.
- Right.

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:28.879
I think this is a game
where you can benefit from sacrifices.

00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:31.423
I think we can secure a win
with this strategy.

00:26:31.507 --> 00:26:34.676
We'll set up a wall in one of these cells
and have two pieces leave the board.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.677
USE THE HUNTER AS A WALL

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:36.887
That seems to be the best.

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.973
So I suggest
that our hunter move toward the exit.

00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:41.600
HAVE THE HUNTER MOVE QUICKLY TO THE EXIT

00:26:41.683 --> 00:26:44.520
I agree that taking control
of the center region matters,

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.647
but we'll likely see
constant changes there.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.774
So why don't we place our pieces

00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:51.527
so we can quickly claim
the rows closer to the center?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.613
Having them there
will restrict the enemy hunter's movement.

00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:56.406
They will have a hard time.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.910
If we have a piece here,
their hunter will be immobilized.

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.453
They can't come here, right?

00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:02.538
Sure.

00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:05.499
I think that should be our priority.

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.293
Okay, then. STEM 1 will go here at first.

00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:09.753
- All right.
- Let's do that.

00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:10.921
When we call our hunter,

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:14.216
their general goal should be
moving toward the center.

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.135
- Yes, for our offense.
- Right.

00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:17.553
HUNTER MOVES TO THE CENTER

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.680
- Once we claim here--
- We're likely to win.

00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:23.350
- Then, we can bring three pieces home.
- It will be very hard to stop us.

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:25.602
- That looks awesome.
- Great.

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:29.523
Since they're going first,
they'll claim the good spots first.

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.442
I think we should secure this cell.

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:34.736
- Yes, to cut the hunter off.
- The hunter can travel this way

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.406
and have their pieces
leave the board in seven turns.

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:40.325
Agreed. Let's secure here to cut them off.

00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:43.745
Our initial focus should be
on reducing their first-mover advantage.

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:45.664
By sending our hunter after them? I see.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:46.957
Since we were going second,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.084
the enemy hunter
would always get one more turn

00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:52.713
before our hunter could take a turn.

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:56.049
Only our hunter
could counter their hunter.

00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:59.261
So the foundation of our defense strategy

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:03.098
was to have our hunter
trail after their hunter.

00:28:03.182 --> 00:28:07.019
You have three minutes left
to discuss your strategy.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:10.314
I think Ji-hu and Seung-hyeon
should be our leaders.

00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:13.942
You're careful and analytical, Sang-yeon.
Why don't you be the hunter?

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.569
- You want me as the hunter?
- Yes.

00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:17.487
- In that case...
- We need some caution.

00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:19.531
But I'd like to point out one thing.

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.326
There's a big difference
between observing the game from afar

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:25.454
and being on the board
as one of the game pieces.

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:29.750
I knew I would make better decisions
as an observer than as an active player.

00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:32.085
Because I knew that about myself,

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:35.130
I wanted to take
on the role of the leader.

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.674
- How about you, Ji-hu?
- Me?

00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:39.593
- Ji-hu as the hunter?
- I bet he'll do great.

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:41.553
Ji-hu will do fine as the hunter,

00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:44.640
considering his great analytical eye
and solid judgment.

00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:46.266
So Ji-hu.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.519
- Why don't you try it for this round?
- I'll give it a go.

00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:51.897
LEADERS: TEAM SNU, LEE SEUNG-HYEON,
TEAM YONSEI, PARK SANG-YEON

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.981
HUNTER: TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:57.361
We should decide
on our leaders and our hunter.

00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:59.112
Gang-hyeon and I can be leaders.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:02.741
Yes, let's leave the responsibility
in our chess players' capable hands.

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.953
I've been a die-hard chess player
even as a boy.

00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:08.872
I probably was the best in the country
among my peers.

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:11.166
None of my peers were at my level
in elementary school,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.460
so I competed against teenagers
and even won.

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:17.798
I'm in the top 0.6% of the players
on the world's biggest online chess site

00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.008
with more than 100 million users.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.427
We had Gang-hyeon on our side.

00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:25.305
I felt certain we could win
if we teamed up as the leaders.

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:28.308
The leaders and the hunter
can request a timeout each.

00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:29.226
How should we use that?

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:31.812
All the more reason
to select our hunter carefully.

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:35.774
They should have as good a grasp
of the game as the leaders.

00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.110
We needed someone
with a solid understanding of the game

00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:40.612
and the ability to think on their feet.

00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:41.780
Dong-geon fit the bill.

00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:43.865
You should do it, Dong-geon.

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.742
I'll be our hunter.

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:51.123
If I see that their piece has a way out,
I'll ask for a timeout right away.

00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:53.083
Your requests shouldn't overlap.

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:55.919
The leaders can submit a request
after the 30-second mark.

00:29:56.003 --> 00:29:57.504
- Okay.
- There's no rush, right?

00:29:57.587 --> 00:30:00.424
The hunter can make a request
before the 30-second mark.

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:01.550
TO SET UP A TIME DIFFERENCE

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:02.634
That's a great idea.

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.220
LEADERS: TEAM SNU, KIM GANG-HYEON,
TEAM KAIST, KANG JI-HOO

00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:06.555
HUNTER: TEAM SNU, KIM DONG-GEON

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.932
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:14.604
Both divisions, please gather
at the main hall for the main match.

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:18.066
- Medical Division!
- Let's go!

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.069
- Let's go, Medical Division!
- All right!

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.321
STEM Division!

00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:25.365
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.712
My nerves are getting to me.

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.298
Don't let them. This is nothing big.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.760
I hope we win.

00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:47.179
Come on, I have faith in our guys.

00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:52.184
All leaders,
please go to your Division Rooms.

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:55.020
That's our cue. Good luck, guys.

00:30:58.398 --> 00:30:59.775
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:00.901
You've got this.

00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:01.818
All right!

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:08.158
It's so reassuring
to have two chess players with us.

00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:13.538
All game pieces, please enter the board
when your assigned role is called.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:16.041
Medical 1 and STEM 1,
please enter the board.

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.168
Keep your eyes peeled for this.

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:20.337
It's a mirror image.

00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:21.880
A perfect symmetry.

00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.466
MEDICAL 1 AND STEM 1 ARE PLACED
ON THE MATCHING SQUARE

00:31:24.758 --> 00:31:25.842
Medical 2 and STEM 2.

00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:27.260
MEDICAL 2, KIM MIN-SEOK
STEM 2, HAN JONG-YUN

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:29.596
Oh, that's pretty aggressive.

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:32.933
- We must cut him off.
- Yes, that's for sure.

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:34.434
Medical 3 and STEM 3.

00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:36.561
MEDICAL 3, CHOI A-IN
STEM 3, KIM JAE-HAN

00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:39.314
MEDICAL 3 AND STEM 3 FORM A SYMMETRY

00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:42.025
Pretty similar.

00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:46.321
Medical 4 and STEM 4.

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:47.739
MEDICAL 4, SUNG TAE-HUN
STEM 4, KIM JI-U

00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:49.116
Medical 5 and STEM 5.

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.826
MEDICAL 5, KIM DONG-YEON
STEM 5, SONG MYEONG-SU

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.494
MEDICAL HUNTER, KANG JI-HU
Hunters, please enter the board.

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.037
STEM HUNTER, KIM DONG-GEON

00:31:54.121 --> 00:31:56.373
ALL IN POSITION FOR ROUND 1

00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:05.215
We will now begin Round 1
of the main match, Exit Strategy 3.

00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:12.347
STEM Division will go first.

00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:14.850
Please select a piece to make a move.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:19.354
- STEM 1 is our obvious choice, no?
- I guess.

00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:21.440
Yes, we need that column no matter what.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.693
- Right, I'll press number one, then.
- Okay.

00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.655
STEM 1, please make your move.

00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:34.453
He went here.

00:32:34.536 --> 00:32:35.787
- Are we calling our hunter?
- Yes.

00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:39.207
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:41.960
MEDICAL HUNTER MOVES TOWARD THE CENTER

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:45.464
- Should we send our own hunter?
- Yes, let's do that.

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.679
- They moved their hunter.
- Our guy should close in.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:58.101
MOVING CLOSER TO THE CENTER

00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:00.312
STEM HUNTER ALSO MOVES CLOSER
TO THE CENTER

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.272
We can now call Medical 3.

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.399
It works for us strategically
if she goes here

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.485
- or here, right?
- Sure.

00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:08.820
If they send someone after her,
we take them.

00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:12.157
Yes, she'll be our bait.

00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:15.869
Medical 3, please make your move.

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:19.748
She'll debate over two options,
though it works for us either way.

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:26.421
MEDICAL 3 CAN EXIT THE BOARD
ON HER NEXT TURN

00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:28.632
- She went here.
- Right.

00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:32.594
- They're just as smart as our guys.
- You bet.

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:33.553
So...

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.307
What's their angle here?

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.893
They'll end up losing this way.

00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:43.980
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:47.943
MEDICAL 3 CAN USE HIM AS A WALL NOW
Take one step away.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.696
All right. This is looking great.

00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:55.408
- Isn't it over?
- I'd say it's almost over.

00:33:55.492 --> 00:33:57.869
They're thrusting a checkmate
into our hands.

00:33:57.953 --> 00:33:59.454
We'll get it in four turns.

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.081
One, two, three, four.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.125
Oh, I recognize this setup.

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:05.961
Me too. We have no way out of this.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.379
- Wait.
- Do we block here?

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:11.967
We fell for the same trick
we wanted to use on them.

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.427
10 MINUTES AGO
If our piece goes here

00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.096
and their hunter follows,
our guy can leave.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.682
If they don't, our hunter can get here
so our piece can leave.

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:20.684
Nothing can stop our piece from exiting.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:23.186
We should all bear this in mind.

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:26.106
- What do we do next?
- Right?

00:34:26.189 --> 00:34:28.650
BLINDSIDED BY THE STRATEGY THEY PREDICTED

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:33.238
Should we still send our guy for defense
or request a timeout?

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.198
- The latter.
- The timeout?

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:40.036
Since we discussed this pattern
during the strategy meeting,

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.663
we could've counteracted it.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.541
It flustered me to realize
that we had missed that.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.546
Medical Division requested a timeout.

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:50.755
MEDICAL DIVISION'S FIRST TIMEOUT REQUEST

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:53.550
You'll be given five minutes.

00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:56.136
Don't we get the same time
to go over strategies?

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.096
Shall we work on plans
for going second in Round 2?

00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.306
CERTAIN OF THEIR VICTORY

00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:00.932
- I don't think they have a way out.
- Right.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.185
We have to accept
that STEM 1 will exit the board.

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.103
Right.

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:09.024
What concerns me is
that STEM 5 can follow suit.

00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:11.860
IF 2 PIECES EXIT IN A ROW,
MEDICAL DIVISION LOSES

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:15.947
Let's go over this again.
Basically, these two can exit the board.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:17.616
So...

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.618
Why don't we try this?

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.578
I mean, the best option for us

00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:24.664
is to have the hunter block this area
to keep this guy from leaving.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.000
- One, two.
- Their hunter will go here.

00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:28.543
- Our hunter will move in.
- Three...

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:30.754
Once STEM 1 goes out, we block.
That's our only option.

00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:33.173
SUCCESSFULLY FENDING OFF
STEM 5 FROM EXITING

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.549
That's all we've got.

00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.426
- Or we'll lose.
- Right.

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.345
Only our hunter can block the way here.

00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:39.846
- We've got to do this.
- Yes.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:40.889
FOUND THE ONLY DEFENSE TACTIC

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:45.310
Their hunter can come around like this
and cut one of our pieces off

00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.270
DONG-GEON PREDICTS MEDICAL DIVISION'S PLAN
if Ji-hu moves soon.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.566
One, two, three, four, five.
That's the best defense they can use.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.276
SECOND PIECE MAY NOT GET TO EXIT

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.528
It's pretty frustrating.

00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:01.117
Your time is up.

00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:03.411
- Nice timing for the timeout.
- Good luck.

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.538
- Let's go. We're in good shape.
- We've got this.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.214
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:16.091
Their best defense strategy

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.051
- was to call the hunter, right?
- Yes.

00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:19.386
Hunter.

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:20.762
SELECTING HUNTER AS DISCUSSED

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.434
STEM Division,

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:28.770
- please select a piece to make a move.
- Hit hunter.

00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:34.526
STEM 1 CAN EXIT THE BOARD ON HIS NEXT TURN

00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:37.028
They're rushing it to leave us no time.

00:36:37.112 --> 00:36:38.405
I noticed that, too.

00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:42.534
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:45.495
STEM 1, please make your move.

00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:53.169
STEM Division's first piece
exited the board.

00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:54.337
FIRST EXIT IN 6 TURNS

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:57.215
MEDICAL DIVISION: 0, STEM DIVISION: 1

00:36:57.298 --> 00:36:58.883
Do we need to call
our hunter one more time?

00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.301
Yes, he needs to get here.

00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:03.221
PREVENTING STEM DIVISION'S PIECE
FROM EXITING

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:04.806
They went for the hunter.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.766
We have no incentive to call STEM 5.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.309
No, not really.

00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:10.437
- Right?
- What do we do next?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.897
Nothing stands out to me.

00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:14.983
It's all complicated.

00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:18.361
I don't see a move
that will get us the win.

00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.614
- How about a timeout?
- Shall we?

00:37:21.698 --> 00:37:24.117
- Medical 3 moving into our camp bugs me.
- Okay.

00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:27.579
STEM Division requested a timeout.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.999
You'll be given five minutes.

00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.125
Hurry.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.212
STEM DIVISION
TIMEOUT

00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.465
We timed out
because we're short of a good move

00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:40.550
and worried about Medical 3
getting into our camp.

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:41.468
Exactly.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.429
Why don't we move STEM 4 first?

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:45.346
The line there...

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.348
- STEM 4?
- What if Medical 3 moves in?

00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:50.268
Then, when she exits, Ji-u can follow.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.645
EXIT THE BOARD FOLLOWING MEDICAL 3'S ROUTE

00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:55.273
- STEM 4 is the best choice.
- Our next piece is STEM 4, then.

00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:56.816
We'll call STEM 4 next.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.526
If STEM 4 moves up like this,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.446
we can send two pieces
to take control of the central row.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.740
TAKING THE CENTRAL ROW
TO PREPARE FOR THE DOUBLE EXITS

00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:06.826
While our guys get lined up,
STEM 2 can go to the opposite side

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.496
and take advantage
of the setup we prepared.

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:10.997
DANGER OF STEM DIVISION'S SECOND EXIT

00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:14.584
So Medical 2 has to wait
and cut STEM 2 off.

00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:17.086
So cut STEM 2 off...

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.465
Yes, we need to do that first
before bringing two pieces home.

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:23.301
Your time is up.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.804
Let us resume the game.

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:34.354
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.606
So I'll go for STEM 4 right away.

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:40.276
STEM 4, please make your move.

00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:45.448
Our plan was to take the central row.

00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:48.910
- So our choice should be Medical 3.
- That's right.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:55.792
STEM 2 will move in, right?

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.669
The way we see it, that's their best bet.

00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:02.340
STEM 5, please make your move.

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.843
STEM 5 SELECTED INSTEAD OF STEM 2

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.597
5 MINUTES AGO
If they call Medical 3,

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:10.598
we'll call STEM 2.

00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:12.225
THEY AGREED TO CALL STEM 2
DURING THE TIMEOUT

00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:19.190
I was expecting to hear Jong-yun's number,

00:39:19.274 --> 00:39:21.526
so I was startled to hear mine.

00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:24.529
1 MINUTE AGO
We'll counter that with STEM 2.

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:25.572
READY TO FOLLOW THE PLAN

00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:26.531
That's the best.

00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:27.532
Two, three.

00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:32.036
They can use Medical 2 to cut off STEM 2
when he gets to the central row.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.954
DEFENSIVE ACTION FOUND

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:33.872
Hang on.

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.416
Medical 2 and 3 can cut off both our guys?

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:38.209
That can put our plan at risk.

00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:45.300
If Dong-geon doesn't call a timeout,
let's go with STEM 5.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.970
STEM 5, please make a move.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.680
STEM 5'S MOVE WASN'T PREPLANNED

00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:53.725
Medical 2, please make your move.

00:39:57.437 --> 00:39:59.981
The overall momentum
seems to shift at each move.

00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:02.650
It looks like we have the upper hand now.

00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:06.195
- We can wait
- STEM Division, please...

00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:09.032
for Dong-geon to request a timeout
after the 30-second mark.

00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:12.452
What a mess.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.954
We're out of plans.

00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:16.039
Tell me about it.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:21.377
I found it strange that the leaders
weren't giving orders based on our plan.

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.301
I'd like to request a timeout.

00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:29.260
STEM HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:30.803
He raised his hand.

00:40:31.054 --> 00:40:34.432
STEM Division requested a timeout.

00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:36.976
You'll be given five minutes.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:43.483
We didn't see
STEM 2 could get intercepted.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.360
Is calling STEM 3 still worth it?

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.569
NEW STRATEGY REQUIRED

00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:48.404
How would STEM 3 move toward the exit?

00:40:48.488 --> 00:40:49.322
He can't.

00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:50.740
- Originally, like this.
- Right.

00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:53.701
HAVING TROUBLE COMING UP WITH A NEW PLAN

00:40:56.621 --> 00:40:57.830
This is the layout.

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.376
Their only countermove
is to get STEM 2 here.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.252
Once we try this,

00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:04.253
we're sure to win.

00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:06.214
If STEM 2 doesn't get here
on his next turn,

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:08.132
we can send Medical 4 here.

00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:10.259
Two more moves,
and our guys are ready to exit.

00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:12.345
BACK-TO-BACK EXITS LEAD TO VICTORY

00:41:12.428 --> 00:41:14.597
This is a sure way to win.

00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:17.266
Your time is up.

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.902
There's a high chance
they won't find a way.

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:31.406
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.866
I bet they'll call STEM 2.

00:41:35.994 --> 00:41:38.997
STEM 3, please make your move.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.790
STEM 3?

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:42.625
What for? Why?

00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:44.752
STEM 3, please make your move.

00:41:51.134 --> 00:41:54.178
STEM 3 TAKES MEDICAL DIVISION BY SURPRISE

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.973
Hey, he got here.

00:41:57.682 --> 00:41:59.100
But why?

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.644
Even the two of us missed this.

00:42:01.728 --> 00:42:05.565
Only one member from our division
saw this was possible.

00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:06.649
Could they have seen this?

00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:10.570
This is a roundabout measure
Medical Division can't defend against.

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:13.948
We can have STEM 3 go here
and then move to the hunter.

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.533
Ji-hu has to stay to hold back STEM 5.

00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:16.868
So if STEM 3 moves up...

00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:20.204
Before any of that,
won't Medical 2 go here and block our way?

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:22.749
We'll set STEM 2 on him
and have the hunter go here.

00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:24.625
- Then, STEM 2 can exit the board.
- Good idea.

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:26.711
We can come at them from both ends.

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:30.965
STEM 3 MOVED
ACCORDING TO JEON JI-MIN'S STRATEGY

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.550
I think we can prime our pieces.

00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:34.552
- Okay, call Medical 2.
- Here we go.

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:35.928
FOLLOWING THEIR ORIGINAL PLAN

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:39.057
Medical 2, please make your move.

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:45.396
They blocked our way.
We can still use STEM 2.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.274
STEM 2, please make your move.

00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.070
What can they do now?

00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.780
Why did STEM 2 move down?
Let's send Medical 4.

00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:55.281
- He's the right choice, right?
- Yes.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.367
Medical 4, please make your move.

00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:01.496
Medical 4.

00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:03.414
He's no threat to our plan.

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:06.959
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.339
- He's on a hunt.
- Okay.

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.840
Do we dangle the bait?

00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:15.009
Medical 4 can move closer.

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:18.429
Let's say he got here,
and their hunter decided to capture him.

00:43:18.513 --> 00:43:21.182
Then, Medical 2 can leave,
followed by Medical 1.

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:23.434
- We're all set.
- Let me count the turns.

00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:24.727
We've got time for this.

00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:25.895
Their hunter moves.

00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:28.523
Then, Medical 1. What if STEM 2 comes in?

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.566
You've got a point there.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.443
MEDICAL 1'S ACCESS WILL BE CUT OFF

00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:34.195
You have 30 seconds left.

00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.035
Ji-hu needs to ask for a timeout.

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.621
If he doesn't,
we'll use Medical 4 as our bait.

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:45.665
You have ten seconds left.

00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:47.583
- Ask for a timeout.
- Call for a timeout.

00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:48.793
Come on.

00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.044
You have five seconds left.

00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:51.337
- Please.
- Hit the number.

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:57.260
Medical 4, please make your move.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.472
Hang on.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.393
What if their hunter steps back
after STEM 2's move?

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.477
Can you repeat that?

00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:09.230
- With Medical 4 there...
- The hunter can pull back?

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.648
Won't these two leave? Wait.

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.817
MEDICAL 2 AND 3 CAN EXIT BACK-TO-BACK

00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:16.571
Oh, man. This really is a headache.

00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:20.116
Wait, I can't believe
we're going neck and neck.

00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:26.330
STEM 2, please make your move.

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.838
STEM 2 CAN EXIT THE BOARD ON HIS NEXT TURN

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.716
Let's have our hunter pull back.

00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:40.845
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:47.602
Our hunter should capture
Medical 4 and run.

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.061
Capture and run?

00:44:49.312 --> 00:44:51.772
I hope our hunter will make a clever move.

00:44:52.732 --> 00:44:55.776
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:04.785
STEM Hunter captured
one of Medical Division's numbered pieces.

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:05.995
There we go.

00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:08.581
- Hey, our plan worked.
- It's working.

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.333
- All right.
- Let's keep it cool.

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:12.460
We achieved our goal,
and they took the bait.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.545
Call Medical 2 right away.
Don't give them time.

00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:17.506
Medical 2, please make your move.

00:45:21.636 --> 00:45:25.306
MEDICAL 2 CAN NOW EXIT THE BOARD

00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:28.059
You have 30 seconds left.

00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:32.313
Why won't he move?

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:35.900
- I clicked number two.
- Why won't he move? Leave already.

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:38.736
You have ten seconds left.

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.279
When Min-seok didn't leave,

00:45:40.947 --> 00:45:43.199
I thought it must be
because he had a message,

00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:45.534
not because he couldn't make up his mind.

00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.620
I'd like to request a timeout.

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:48.621
HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:51.582
Medical Division requested a timeout.

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.626
You'll be given five minutes.

00:45:57.213 --> 00:45:59.674
This is great for us.
Doesn't this mean we're going to win?

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.467
EXPECTING A VICTORY

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.094
- We're going to win.
- Really?

00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:06.180
All we have to do now
is call our hunter next.

00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:07.265
That's all.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.351
- STEM 2 will exit the board.
- Let's say he left.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.603
Then, their hunter will move down.

00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:16.941
If their hunter gets here,
we're going to win.

00:46:19.277 --> 00:46:21.195
If he moves down instead,
Medical 1 will follow.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:24.240
Medical 1 will be our bait,
allowing us to use their hunter as a wall.

00:46:24.323 --> 00:46:25.908
LURE STEM HUNTER TO USE HIM AS A WALL

00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:28.953
I'm worried they might try this.

00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:30.121
Hold on.

00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:31.914
DONG-GEON PREDICTS MEDICAL DIVISION'S PLAN

00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:34.333
It all ends, then. Let me think it over.

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:35.334
So...

00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:36.919
You should go up or left.

00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:41.257
Yes, but I'd strongly suggest moving up
because Medical 1 bugs the hell out of me.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.259
Why don't we keep him in check?

00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.469
This is a raw analytic power battle.

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:47.471
Let's trust each other's skills.

00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:50.141
Your time is up.

00:46:50.933 --> 00:46:52.685
Let us resume the game.

00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:57.606
Medical 2, please make your move.

00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:04.155
Medical Division's first piece
exited the board.

00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:06.240
MEDICAL DIVISION: 1, STEM DIVISION: 1

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.368
- Let's call our hunter right away.
- Okay.

00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:12.997
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:15.124
We'll call our hunter.

00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:17.877
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:22.673
Medical Hunter captured
one of STEM Division's numbered pieces.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.886
Their hunter may travel up like this.

00:47:27.345 --> 00:47:29.013
What can we do to stop him?

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:37.229
Let's wait for their hunter to move,

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:40.941
have STEM 2 move down,
and let our hunter take his place.

00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:42.401
STEM 2 CAN THEN EXIT THE BOARD

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:46.072
That puts us ahead of them.

00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:47.740
- STEM 2 exits before their guy, right?
- Yes.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:48.908
In that case...

00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:50.493
- STEM 3?
- Shall we?

00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:53.454
- We decided to rescue him anyway.
- Sure.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:02.713
I expect we'll have a fierce battle
of attacks and counterattacks from now on.

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:04.799
MEDICAL 1'S MOVE

00:48:05.174 --> 00:48:07.385
STEM 3'S DEFENSIVE MANEUVER

00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:09.553
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:12.556
MEDICAL HUNTER'S MOVE

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:15.226
STEM 3'S MOVE

00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:17.186
Where are they trying to send him?

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.396
What's their play?

00:48:19.105 --> 00:48:21.941
Making the turn here might be
the most difficult option for him to see.

00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:24.860
Look behind you. There's an open spot.

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:35.162
- Thank goodness.
- All right.

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:36.330
This is neat.

00:48:36.414 --> 00:48:39.125
When our hunter gets here,
the game's over.

00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.043
- What if--
- Hold on.

00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:41.961
What's up?

00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:44.964
One, two, three, four.

00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:46.924
It's over. We can't do anything.

00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:48.342
- You're right.
- We lose.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:50.428
We're going to lose?

00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:53.431
We'll finally get
our checkmate this time, right?

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.850
They can't throw a curve now.

00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.685
We've said we won like five times already.

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.853
From the start, yes.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.188
I was so sure during our first timeout,
but they scored a point.

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:03.441
We celebrated like five times already.

00:49:03.524 --> 00:49:05.359
Are we out of options?

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:07.611
- Let me think.
- You have ten seconds left.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.533
- Shall we use Medical 5 as a bait?
- Let's try that.

00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:15.619
Then, their hunter must retreat, right?

00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:17.955
That will cost them a turn, too.

00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:21.500
Medical 5, please make your move.

00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:26.088
What's their plan?

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.341
Oh, shoot.

00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:32.303
MEDICAL 3 CAN EXIT
USING MEDICAL 5 AS A WALL

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:35.639
- Dong-geon has to back away. How's here?
- Let's go for it.

00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:39.935
They are no pushovers.

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:45.399
MEDICAL 3 PUTS STEM HUNTER UNDER PRESSURE

00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:48.777
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.661
- What if the hunter captures our guy?
- Wait.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.040
The following 4 turns will go like this.
Then, Ji-hu can capture STEM 3.

00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.374
We should call him, no?

00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:03.334
NEW DEFENSE FOUND

00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:05.044
I hope Ji-hu will get our idea.

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.756
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:50:12.468 --> 00:50:13.928
- As expected.
- Of course.

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:16.597
- He's a clever guy.
- Somehow,

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.225
we keep managing to find
the sole solution to our problems.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.728
STEM 3, please make your move.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.277
- We'll call Ji-hu next, right?
- Yes, he can capture their guy.

00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:32.363
Please go catch him.

00:50:32.446 --> 00:50:34.031
Please do, Ji-hu. He won't miss this.

00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:38.994
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.967
KANG JI-HU MOVED
AGAINST HIS LEADERS' WISHES

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.260
- No.
- Oh, no!

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:56.595
- Damn.
- No...

00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:02.142
- The hunter...
- Thank goodness he went there.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.937
Once our STEM 3 moves,
the game's as good as won.

00:51:05.646 --> 00:51:08.774
One, two, three, four...

00:51:09.483 --> 00:51:12.611
STEM 3 REMAINS VULNERABLE
TO MEDICAL HUNTER

00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:15.114
Wait a minute. That can happen?

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:17.783
It's not over yet. We can still get him.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.743
Three, four. You're right.

00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:22.288
- It's not over yet.
- It's still on.

00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.248
Shall we call our hunter first?

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.584
I think we can skip STEM 3.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.712
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:35.301
What the heck?

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.262
What's their angle?

00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:43.392
They must want to position him
as STEM 2's stepping stone.

00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:46.228
How do we prevent that?

00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.480
Medical 5 should travel up.

00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:51.442
He can then get into position
using their hunter and help A-in exit.

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:52.985
- You have 10 seconds left.
- Hit number 5.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.863
Let's take a leap of faith.
There's no other way.

00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:59.283
Medical 5, please make your move.

00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:02.161
- Medical 5, at this point?
- Medical 5?

00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:04.997
If I were Medical 5,
my brain would just freeze.

00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:09.251
I was thinking that our best bet

00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:12.504
was to send our hunter after their piece
and engage in the battle of wits.

00:52:12.588 --> 00:52:15.132
But I was called to move
all out of the blue.

00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.594
You have ten seconds left.

00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:28.771
KIM DONG-YEON MOVED
AGAINST HIS LEADERS' WISHES

00:52:28.854 --> 00:52:31.065
Why would you go there?

00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:33.359
But why?

00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:39.323
- Our only safe choice is our hunter.
- Yeah.

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:40.658
Right?

00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:43.661
STEM Hunter, please make a move.

00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:55.130
This is our only avenue for attack.

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:58.425
But their piece can leave in two turns.

00:53:05.641 --> 00:53:08.811
I can't see a way around this.

00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:11.647
You have ten seconds left.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.273
Do we go with our hunter?

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.442
- He has the best maneuverability.
- That's true.

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:16.527
A RELUCTANT CHOICE

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.613
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:21.824
STEM Hunter...

00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:25.035
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:53:25.494 --> 00:53:28.247
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.751
STEM DIVISION CAN HAVE
THEIR SECOND PIECE EXIT NEXT

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.587
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:44.096
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:46.306
Make sure to press number two.

00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:49.393
"STEM Hunter, please make your move."

00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:51.395
Number two.

00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:52.646
- Got it.
- Two.

00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:55.816
STEM 2, please make your move.

00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:02.823
STEM Division's second piece
exited the board.

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:09.955
That concludes Round 1 of Exit Strategy 3.

00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:12.666
The round ends in STEM Division's victory.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.460
STEM DIVISION WINS ROUND 1

00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:15.377
It's over.

00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:16.795
- Such a shame.
- How upsetting.

00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:20.799
It's so sad.

00:54:20.883 --> 00:54:22.134
Good work.

00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:23.594
That was rough.

00:54:23.844 --> 00:54:26.180
At any rate, we won Round 1.

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:28.557
- Unbelievable.
- We could've prevented that.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.482
Both divisions,
please return to your Division Rooms.

00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:47.117
Well done, guys.

00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:48.035
I'm so glad.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.995
- How did you pull through this?
- It was so close.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.581
I knew we would win this round.

00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:57.753
The leaders and I saw eye to eye
every step of the way,

00:54:57.836 --> 00:55:00.380
and our players moved
the way the leaders wanted.

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:03.926
I'm proud of the amazing teamwork
we showed in Round 1.

00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:05.803
It's such a shame.

00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:08.305
We did great, and it was really close.

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.432
We have it in us to beat them
in the next rounds.

00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:13.560
Let's fire up our good teamwork
and win the remaining rounds.

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:16.063
- Okay, let's get back to the game.
- We called Medical 5...

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:19.441
MEDICAL DIVISION REVIEWS ROUND 1

00:55:19.733 --> 00:55:21.735
I don't blame you for not catching it.

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:23.695
He might've
if we had called him one turn later.

00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:26.073
We did call you
when their hunter was here.

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.533
I guess we jumped the gun.

00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:32.037
If we had called you when he was here,
you would've noticed and thought of a way.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.958
We were on par with STEM Division
despite conceding a point early on.

00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:40.462
That made me believe
that we could win the two coming rounds.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:45.509
Round 2 of Exit Strategy 3 will now begin.

00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:48.303
You have 20 minutes to discuss strategies.

00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.849
It just dawned on me
that we can place multiple pieces here

00:55:51.932 --> 00:55:54.434
and have them wait.

00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:56.979
If their hunter approaches,

00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:59.314
we can set up STEM 2 against him
and have STEM 3 exit.

00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:02.276
LINING UP IN THE CENTRAL ROW
FOR AN IMMEDIATE EXIT

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:07.030
Pieces lined up in the central row alone
was pretty intimidating to me.

00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:09.491
Looking back on our moves in Round 1,

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:13.704
we mostly used our numbered pieces
to build set pieces early on.

00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:16.123
But STEM Division
mostly used their hunter.

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:18.625
- That's true.
- Early on, they relied on their hunter.

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:22.087
I think that will remain
as their core strategy.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.464
We should consider
involving our hunter in attacks

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:25.632
since we're going first.

00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:26.967
At the start...

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.677
One, two, three, four.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.971
We'll call our hunter
for four turns straight.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.599
Let's say Ji-hu moves here.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:37.019
- We can set up Medical 4 here.
- Oh, that's your goal?

00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:41.231
We need to make preparations
to score twice in minimal steps.

00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:45.444
You have two minutes left.

00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:47.362
Shouldn't we decide on our roles?

00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:49.531
- Any volunteers for the hunter?
- You're it, dude.

00:56:49.615 --> 00:56:50.699
Understood.

00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:52.242
GOING INTO ROUND 2 WITHOUT CHANGES

00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:53.452
We worked well together,

00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:55.537
so I wanted everyone
to keep their positions.

00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:58.165
Let's win the next round
and wrap this up quickly.

00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:01.543
- We're not changing the leaders, right?
- No.

00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.963
Our defeat wasn't
due to anyone's weak performance.

00:57:05.047 --> 00:57:07.507
We decided to keep everyone
in their original position

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:09.426
so they could draw on their experience.

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:14.765
Both divisions, please gather
at the main hall for the main match.

00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:17.643
Let's do our chant.

00:57:17.726 --> 00:57:18.560
Come on.

00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:19.561
Medical Division!

00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:21.605
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:23.440
- How about a chant?
- Let's do it.

00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:25.192
STEM Division!

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.985
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:30.822
Pieces of both divisions,
please go to your positions.

00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:35.953
ALL THE NUMBERED PIECES ARE IN PLACE

00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:39.039
Hunters, please enter the board.

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.757
What's this? They tweaked their placement.

00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:51.385
What's this?

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:53.136
Why did they put their hunter here?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.263
- He's standing far in the back.
- He's here, isn't he?

00:57:55.347 --> 00:57:57.808
- Can you double-check for me?
- He's here.

00:57:58.684 --> 00:58:02.187
STEM Division's new placement
took us by surprise.

00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:05.524
Fortunately,
they don't have any surprises.

00:58:05.607 --> 00:58:07.609
Our hunter will handle
most of the traveling.

00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:09.903
- We have it all mapped out.
- Sure.

00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:15.742
We're going second, so why don't we
let them take this and run up this way?

00:58:16.535 --> 00:58:17.953
- I'll be here--
- At the start?

00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:20.330
- Yes, I'll head to the central column.
- With STEM 5 here?

00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:21.790
Yes, exactly.

00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:24.543
Then, Medical 4 will get here.
Why don't I take him out?

00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:26.962
THE HUNTER WILL MOVE
TO SHUT DOWN THE OPPONENT'S PLAY

00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.589
- Let's think.
- Okay.

00:58:30.716 --> 00:58:34.136
We will now begin Round 2
of the main match, Exit Strategy 3.

00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:35.053
EXIT STRATEGY 3
ROUND 2

00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:38.640
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.601
I think they'll attack this way.

00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:42.978
Oh, I get it.

00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:44.271
Using these two, right?

00:58:46.982 --> 00:58:50.193
What can they do if Medical 4 blocks that?

00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:54.072
Medical 4, please make your move.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:58.744
We agreed to utilize
the hunter at the outset.

00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:00.954
So I wondered why they called my number.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.879
Okay, great.

00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:12.632
- I think we can call our hunter.
- Agreed.

00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:15.469
That's a prime spot.

00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:17.220
- I'll call our hunter.
- Okay.

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:21.308
STEM HUNTER'S MOVE

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:26.605
- What is it?
- Doesn't this row here

00:59:26.688 --> 00:59:29.066
- look promising?
- I see what you mean.

00:59:29.149 --> 00:59:30.859
Shall we just send Medical 3 over?

00:59:31.777 --> 00:59:34.738
Medical 3, please make your move.

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:35.822
MEDICAL 3'S MOVE

00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:45.332
How would they respond
if our hunter got here?

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.959
I guess Medical 4 can retreat
and waste his turn.

00:59:48.376 --> 00:59:49.920
I'll call our hunter, then.

00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:53.173
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

00:59:56.051 --> 00:59:58.512
- Hit number 4.
- Let's roll with Medical 4.

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.807
MEDICAL 4'S MOVE

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.016
Hunter, of course.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.519
When he approaches, Medical 4 will run.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.355
Isn't it better for us
to have Medical 4 here?

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.439
For sure.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.275
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.485
STEM HUNTER'S MOVE

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.031
Medical 4 has to get back here.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.617
Then, we can't utilize our hunter.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.828
Things got a little crazy for us.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.288
You have ten seconds left.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:29.167
- But we need Medical 4. Let's save him.
- Go for it.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.836
MEDICAL 4'S MOVE

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:40.095
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.305
Let's think this over.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.644
You have 30 seconds left.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.773
A timeout, please.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.358
A timeout, please.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.152
STEM HUNTER'S TIMEOUT A REQUEST

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.906
Did he catch something just now?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.199
He must've.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.910
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have called a timeout.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.622
- I guess he has a plan.
- Yeah.

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:11.418
STEM Division requested a timeout.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.589
I'm worried about their hunter
coming into our camp.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:16.965
If he positions himself here--

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:19.676
Then, two guys can leave. It's really bad.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.470
What are the odds
of their hunter not moving?

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:26.141
- Very low. They don't have many options.
- Their biggest swing for now

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.726
is sending the hunter here.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.936
TIMEOUT ENDS

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.480
Let us resume the game.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.861
STEM 1, please make your move.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:38.904
STEM 1'S MOVE

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.030
What?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.907
MEDICAL DIVISION PREDICTED
STEM HUNTER WOULD MOVE

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.619
See? They want to take the central column.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.831
TIMEOUT
Listen, guys.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:51.791
Call STEM 1 first.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.127
KIM DONG-GEON REQUESTED A TIMEOUT
FOR THIS MOVE

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.046
If I move here,
Medical 4 becomes an issue.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.464
They might score first.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.007
MEDICAL 4 CAN TAKE THE CENTRAL ROW

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.968
I think we should have STEM 1 move first.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.053
TO SECURE THE CENTRAL COLUMN

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.640
So you want the threat neutralized
before moving on to scoring.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.682
All right.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:13.188
AS PLANNED,
STEM DIVISION TOOK THE CENTRAL COLUMN

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.732
What we can do now is call Medical 1

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.652
so he can exit the board
right after their piece leaves.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.653
You're right.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.780
- We've got to, right?
- Yes, go for it.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.783
MEDICAL 1'S MOVE

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.330
We can roll with STEM 1, no?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.541
STEM 1'S MOVE

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.671
Shouldn't we get Medical 4 out of the way?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.257
We should make way for our hunter,
just in case.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.675
- You want Medical 4 here?
- Yes.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:45.053
Okay, let's call him
and clear the road for our hunter.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:48.682
I think they're trying
to make way for their hunter.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.350
Still, our guys can exit the board.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.434
- I'll call our hunter.
- Okay.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:52.852
- That's for the best, right?
- Sure.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.731
Our hunter should also approach the exit.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.608
- Agreed?
- Yes, let's call him.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:02.070
Our hunter has to move closer
to seize the exit area.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.990
- We've actually been delayed.
- Okay, I get your point.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.284
We'd need our hunter here, right?

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:08.994
I suggest STEM 5.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.203
- For the next move?
- Yes.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.122
STEM 1 can hold Medical 1 back.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.665
Then, we can get these two to exit.

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:14.833
USING THE CENTRAL ROW

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.835
Without moving the hunter? Okay.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.087
STEM 5, it is.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.424
Why STEM 5?

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.092
So no exits for now?

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:27.595
We could send our hunter
to press STEM 1 to exit the board.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.681
- Okay, we'll call our hunter
- Okay.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:30.932
to force STEM 1's hand.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.853
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.772
- Maybe--
- Hang on!

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:38.857
What's the matter?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.816
We're going to lose.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:43.111
- What? How come?
- Because we can't stop them.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.029
There's no way.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.869
I'd like to request a timeout.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.246
MEDICAL HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.207
Medical Division requested a timeout.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.252
You'll be given five minutes.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.130
Isn't it basically over?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:05.550
- We're about to lose.
- No matter where I choose to go...

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:08.053
If I go here,
we're going to lose for sure.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.013
It's the same even if I go elsewhere.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:14.768
Great work, guys.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.227
We're on the same page, no?

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.229
I liked that you didn't call STEM 1.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.815
- My only concern now is
- Good job.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.109
that Ji-hu requested a timeout.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.736
He might have a way out of this.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.738
I think he did it because he had none.

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:30.033
Given our situation,
our hunter has to make a move.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.368
- He can't go here.
- No.

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.828
Is there no way to stop them in two turns?

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:35.872
What if he went to the right?

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.541
Once STEM 1 exits,
Ji-hu can close in on Dong-geon.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:40.001
Then, Dong-geon can't move left.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.128
BRINGS 2 PIECES HOME
AFTER HOLDING STEM HUNTER IN PLACE

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.131
- You're right!
- That's incredible.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.549
To get to this point,

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:49.302
we'll have to pray
that they call STEM 1 home.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:52.097
It's our only option.
We lose otherwise, right?

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.349
- Your time is up.
- Let's go.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:55.892
- Good luck.
- We've got this!

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.980
Let us resume the game.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.775
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:07.237
AS PLANNED,
MEDICAL HUNTER TAKES A STEP TO HIS RIGHT

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:11.282
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.410
Please bring STEM 1 home.

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:14.953
Then, we get our way out.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.205
- Call STEM 1.
- Leave the board, STEM 1.

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.540
Come on, STEM 1.

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.250
Please forget the hunter's button.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.167
Hit number one.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.210
A CRITICAL DECISION

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.088
- Let's get right to it.
- Okay.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:26.881
STEM...

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.054
- Please...
- STEM Hunter,

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.472
please make your move.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.810
Let's review this.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.233
That's when I felt sure the game was ours.

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:48.736
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:51.614
You have ten seconds left.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.534
What do I do? We're out of ideas.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.329
Medical 4, please make your move.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.669
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.966
STEM DIVISION'S 3 PIECES ARE READY TO EXIT

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.385
- Oh, no. It's over.
- What a shame.

01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.430
This is just...

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.102
I can't believe we got
a crushing defeat like this.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.898
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.820
Let's line up two pieces
and have them exit back-to-back

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.072
- for some thrill.
- For some thrill?

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:36.117
STEM 3, please make your move.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:37.202
STEM 3'S MOVE

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.122
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.210
STEM 3, please make your move.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:50.548
STEM Division's first piece
exited the board.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:55.637
STEM 5, please make your move.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.853
STEM Division's second piece
exited the board.

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.150
That concludes Round 2 of Exit Strategy 3.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.361
The round ends in STEM Division's victory.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.779
STEM DIVISION WINS EXIT STRATEGY 3

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.866
They're so good.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.035
Annoyingly so.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.246
Seriously, it bugs me how good they are.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:25.083
We've been on the same wavelength
the whole time. I loved it.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:30.296
The devastating loss in Mine and Trade
made me fear Medical Division.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.758
But today's game taught me
that they weren't so invincible.

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:36.261
It looks like we can keep winning
going forward.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.304
My team and Team SNU in STEM
clicked so well.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.890
I think our division can win
if we can keep it up.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.767
I gained that confidence today.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.271
I'm upset that we gave them
a landslide victory in Round 2.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:50.191
Maybe we should've been bold
and called a timeout early on.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:51.818
That's my biggest regret.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.404
By the game's design,

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:59.993
our decisions as leaders
affected the other contestants' plays.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:04.789
So I felt accountable to my teammates.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.961
That concludes the main match,
Exit Strategy 3.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.465
The result will now be announced.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:15.508
STEM Division.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:19.178
Congratulations, Team SNU in STEM
and Team KAIST are the winners.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.849
In light of Medical Division's defeat,

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.225
Team SNU in Medicine,

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:25.476
Team Yonsei,

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.020
and Team SKKU,

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.439
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.740
It will be a shocker
if Team SNU is sent home.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.867
The great Lee Seung-hyeon
getting eliminated here?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.202
Let's make sure
we get to smile after this.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.788
All the winners experienced
at least one Deathmatch.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.582
This is our playground.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:51.127
We will now begin today's Deathmatch.

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:53.630
Go for it. But don't share anything.

01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:55.131
That was a killer.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.592
You have to be that bold
to win a Deathmatch.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.594
Who could stop Team SNU in Medicine now?

01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:01.929
If Team SKKU goes home,
we'll be in a better position.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.097
Run it quickly.

01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:04.265
- It's 89.
- That's 89?

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:05.892
Hit that buzzer.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:07.852
You again, Ji-hu?

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.355
- This seems impossible.
- I'm in utter awe.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:11.814
Team SKKU is the biggest threat.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.149
Why are they targeting Team Yonsei?

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:16.653
Want to give it a try?

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.112
He's making a submission.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.199
Oh, please...

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.242
Come on...

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:26.371
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

01:09:26.454 --> 01:09:27.872
Okay, I'm getting the hang of it.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.625
