It's way too early,
and I haven't even washed my face.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.030
It's way too early,
and I haven't even washed my face.

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:53.826
Where are you taking me?
Tell me where we're going at least.

00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:07.381
Mr. Kim!

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:21.937
Is it really you?
Are you really, truly my Mr. Kim?

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:23.480
I really am your Mr. Kim.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.359
-Mr. Kim!
-Oh, my.

00:01:29.737 --> 00:01:30.905
Did you bring him here?

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:33.490
You need to know how much effort I made.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.286
Then are you staying with me
from now on? Yeah?

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.789
Well, Kyeong-do begged me to do so.

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.627
But where's the highlight?

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:49.882
Hey… How can I wear that at this age?

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:52.468
You don't know how to throw a surprise.

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.385
Gosh…

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.349
How am I supposed to put this on?

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:02.811
You yourself are the gift.
It even matches your personal color.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:03.729
Give it to me.

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:05.606
You want me to?

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.565
Just this once.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.193
-Okay. Fine, do it.
-Do it?

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:11.487
Here…

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.656
-You look so pretty.
-Really?

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.990
It looks good on you, Mr. Kim.

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:16.408
-Really?
-Yeah, totally!

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:19.453
You… All right.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.164
Now, where to?

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.677
Mr. Kim, did you read the articles
about my divorce?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.846
Of course I did. Good job.
I'm proud of you.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.307
You can just live freely
like the people these days,

00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:42.893
and if it doesn't work,
just find a new one.

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:46.605
Honestly, you can get married
even three times with that beauty.

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:49.733
I agree with you.
It'd be a shame to waste my beauty.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.152
But three times is too many.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.158
Anyway, have you been keeping in touch
with Kyeong-do?

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:00.619
And together, you missed me?

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.673
WINTER, 2015

NAME: LEE HAN-SOO

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:44.872
WISHING YOU A FAST RECOVERY

00:04:17.863 --> 00:04:23.243
INPATIENT WARD

00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:25.329
-Mr. Kim!
-Hey.

00:04:28.123 --> 00:04:29.291
I knew it was you.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.419
I was in the area.

00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:37.049
Mr. Kim, I appreciate this, but…

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:40.427
we don't need it.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.263
Take it. I got a lot for my severance pay.

00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:44.556
Severance pay?

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:49.728
I quit. It happened.

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:54.817
It's not much. Get something
for your parents to cheer them up.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:04.493
Thank you.

00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:09.206
Kyeong-do.

00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:15.420
Life can be stifling
even when we're doing our best, right?

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:22.344
Still, cheer up. That's how you carry on.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.850
Bye. Make sure to eat well.

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:28.934
Okay.

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:01.216
Kyeong-do.

00:06:03.886 --> 00:06:04.720
Yeah?

00:06:05.554 --> 00:06:08.807
Thank you so much
for bringing back Mr. Kim.

00:06:10.017 --> 00:06:11.894
I've never even thought about it.

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:16.273
I did all of this for you--

00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:17.733
Let's take my press release photo.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.694
Please?

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.661
I feel like facing this side tonight.

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:30.996
Kyeong-do.

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.167
Kyeong-do?

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:40.923
If you do it after a punch,
it breaks both our hearts, doesn't it?

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:43.800
Do it when I'm still being nice, okay?

00:06:44.927 --> 00:06:48.305
The cell phones these days
have really nice cameras, you know?

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:50.849
Let's take just a few, okay?

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.102
I love you, Kyeong-do, yeah?

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.854
Yeah? Yeah?

00:06:55.938 --> 00:06:57.814
This love is twisted.

00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:00.067
I love you, Kyeong-do. Yeah?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.569
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:05.572
EPISODE 8

00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:13.038
So, one more lap?

00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.585
Didn't you learn about
saving energy when you were little?

00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.632
I know how the first day at work
makes you tense,

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:26.718
but we've been going around
five times already.

00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:32.391
Why don't you just take the bus next time?
Or you can take the subway.

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:35.519
Mr. Kim, hurry up.
I have to use the restroom.

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:39.273
My gosh, so why did you
gulp down all that coffee?

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:53.453
-Hello?
-We're arriving soon. Focus.

00:07:53.537 --> 00:07:54.538
Hey, look--

00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:57.582
My goodness.

00:07:59.084 --> 00:08:00.043
Okay.

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:05.173
Bye.

00:08:05.257 --> 00:08:06.091
Good luck!

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:33.160
One more time.

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:01.813
But why is she making me do this?

00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:06.026
She's pretty though.

00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.429
DIRECTOR SEO JI-WOO
OF JARIM APPAREL'S FIRST STEP

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:39.393
JARIM Apparel's PR Team is working hard.

00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:40.852
What is it?

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:45.232
"Director Seo Ji-woo
of JARIM Apparel's first step."

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:46.942
This one.

00:09:47.442 --> 00:09:48.693
What a nice picture.

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:53.407
Someone in their PR Team must've worked
until their knees got worn out for this.

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:58.120
Who knows if it was their employee,
or someone in love with her?

00:09:59.913 --> 00:10:00.997
What?

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:04.376
What?

00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:07.045
What are you saying?

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:12.008
Hello?

00:10:12.092 --> 00:10:15.011
Hi. I'm calling you
regarding the results for the analysis

00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:17.097
-you requested last time.
-Okay.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.765
Didroxin?

00:10:19.307 --> 00:10:21.685
Yes, that's what was found.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.981
Well… What is that used for?

00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:28.650
It's prescribed
to the Stick Syndrome patients.

00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:30.569
Stick Syndrome?

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:32.904
It's a type of chronic vascular disease.

00:10:33.447 --> 00:10:34.948
KOREA GENERAL ACADEMIC PAPERS DB

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:41.455
DIDROXIN

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:44.291
It's manageable
as long as they take the medicine,

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.501
and the drug doesn't have
any dangerous toxicity.

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:49.546
However, in case of overdose,
it can cause side effects.

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.965
So they need to consult the doctor.

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:55.427
What kind of side effects?

00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:58.555
Memory loss and cognitive disorder.

00:10:59.264 --> 00:11:02.100
The common symptoms of Alzheimer's.

00:11:04.436 --> 00:11:06.021
THE SIDE EFFECTS OF DIDROXIN

00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:12.569
DAMAGE TO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

00:11:13.612 --> 00:11:15.614
The problem is,
the dosage came out pretty high.

00:11:15.697 --> 00:11:18.450
A SERIOUS COGNITIVE DISORDER
HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.929
Hi, Ms. Seo. It's me.
Do you have time to meet?

00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:41.056
Come in.

00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:58.281
Thank you.

00:12:01.618 --> 00:12:02.661
One second.

00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:18.927
Don't drink
what the secretaries give you anymore.

00:12:21.763 --> 00:12:24.266
The coffee I took last time.

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:29.938
So I can drink it later.

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:32.148
Oh, yes. That.

00:12:33.108 --> 00:12:35.735
I actually had it analyzed.

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:38.113
Are you taking Didroxin by chance?

00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:40.198
Didroxin…

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.619
I think I used to take it in the past.

00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:47.497
But I'm taking something else right now.

00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:49.291
But why do you ask…

00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:50.834
Well…

00:12:52.127 --> 00:12:54.796
Can I ask why you changed your medicine?

00:12:56.798 --> 00:13:01.303
At the time,
I was on a business trip abroad.

00:13:02.012 --> 00:13:05.390
I think my husband said
he was meeting my doctor.

00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:09.477
He said the doctor wanted to
change my prescription

00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:11.438
because better medicine was released.

00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:14.482
But you didn't hear that
directly from your doctor?

00:13:15.483 --> 00:13:16.526
No.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.654
Is there a problem with that medicine?

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:22.616
The medicine itself isn't bad.

00:13:23.658 --> 00:13:25.493
But it can cause side effects.

00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:31.374
I looked up some papers
and consulted medical reporters as well.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:36.504
And I think it's related
to your Alzheimer's symptoms.

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:39.633
Why is that in my coffee…

00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:43.303
Who would…

00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:49.601
I doubt it.

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:53.897
He wouldn't do such a…

00:13:54.522 --> 00:13:58.777
Nothing is certain.
But you should still be careful.

00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:06.201
Don't take any drinks or food
from Secretary Yoo.

00:14:07.202 --> 00:14:10.288
Still, if you take nothing from her,
she might notice.

00:14:10.372 --> 00:14:13.416
So you need to act naturally
until you have evidence.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.547
You should set up a camera in the pantry.

00:14:21.091 --> 00:14:21.966
Okay.

00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:30.850
I owe you more and more.

00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:34.145
How am I ever going to repay you?

00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:39.776
It's just a reporter's hunch.
I didn't do much.

00:14:40.402 --> 00:14:41.611
I didn't know you were ill.

00:14:43.988 --> 00:14:46.241
All I have to do is just take medicine.

00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:48.952
It doesn't affect my daily life.

00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:51.496
It's not life-threatening.

00:14:57.252 --> 00:15:00.797
How about we talk to Ji-woo about this?
She should know…

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:04.217
Right. I should talk to her.

00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:08.888
Would you like to see her before you go?

00:15:09.723 --> 00:15:12.475
She probably shouldn't know that I'm here.

00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:32.954
You should've waited at home.

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:35.623
I just got here.
Mr. Kim, thank you for your work.

00:15:35.707 --> 00:15:38.793
Fix her work fright.
As a more experienced office worker.

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.587
Director Seo, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.047
Good night, Mr. Kim.

00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:44.174
Good night.

00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:56.269
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

00:16:00.523 --> 00:16:02.108
Did you have first-day jitters?

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:06.446
Don't even get me started.
I circled around, like, five times.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.407
When there's no oil in this country?

00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:10.992
You sound just like Mr. Kim.

00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:14.370
He told me to take the bus next time.

00:16:15.622 --> 00:16:18.833
Hey, you have to be smart
to take the public transit.

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:22.086
You're too clumsy.
You'd end up crying in the street.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.548
"Waa, I got off at the wrong stop.
Come pick me up."

00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:27.133
Hey, go home.

00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:31.805
-Go. Go elsewhere.
-"Waa, how am I going to get home?"

00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:33.681
Watch out for the stairs and the cars.

00:16:33.765 --> 00:16:37.101
Jin-u, go straight to taekwondo.
If you skip it again, you're living here.

00:16:37.185 --> 00:16:39.062
-Okay!
-Okay. Bye!

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:41.523
-Bye!
-Bye, guys. Hyo-bin, bye!

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:44.943
Yes, my mom is coming later.
She said she'll dine out with Dong-won.

00:16:45.026 --> 00:16:46.194
Yay!

00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:48.279
Did you finish it?

00:16:48.363 --> 00:16:49.280
Yes, it's inside.

00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:52.700
Inside. My wife said it's inside.

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:56.579
-Is that it?
-Yes.

00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:01.751
I can't believe she asked for this.
Does Seo Ji-woo think she's a duchess?

00:17:01.835 --> 00:17:03.795
Who asks for a portrait these days?

00:17:03.878 --> 00:17:04.838
She paid me a lot.

00:17:05.797 --> 00:17:07.924
The most I've ever gotten for my painting.

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:13.388
Well, I just sounded her out,
and she sent me the money.

00:17:14.806 --> 00:17:15.890
Did you do your best?

00:17:16.516 --> 00:17:17.642
I ground my bones.

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:19.978
You should've painted Kyeong-do
as a bonus.

00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:22.063
I didn't think about that.

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:24.148
Jeez, you lack the service attitude.

00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:26.651
You should've been a businessman.

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:36.119
Why are you acting like this?

00:17:36.202 --> 00:17:37.203
Why do you think?

00:17:37.287 --> 00:17:39.414
Honestly, asking about
the informant is too--

00:17:39.497 --> 00:17:41.082
The informant was Kang Min-woo.

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:43.585
Kang Min-woo… Who is that?

00:17:43.668 --> 00:17:46.254
Kang Min-woo gave you
the article about An Da-hye.

00:17:46.337 --> 00:17:48.631
JARIM Apparel CEO Seo Ji-yeon's husband.

00:17:49.173 --> 00:17:50.133
It was him?

00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:52.468
What are you doing?

00:17:53.386 --> 00:17:54.679
I didn't receive it from him.

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:55.597
Then who?

00:18:00.685 --> 00:18:02.312
Jeez. Hey.

00:18:03.354 --> 00:18:06.733
Don't you know me? Come clean,
or you can't walk out that door.

00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:12.530
Quick delivery! It was a quick delivery.

00:18:12.614 --> 00:18:15.533
I was too embarrassed to say it.
You could've just let it slide.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.995
-Quick delivery?
-Yes! Quick! Quick delivery!

00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:22.832
So Reporter Nam,
if you support Reporter Choi

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:25.335
with the interview and email it to me…

00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:28.796
-Need any help?
-Where is the Entertainment Team?

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.090
You can give that to me. I'm on that team.

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:33.718
-Sign here.
-Okay.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.348
-Thank you.
-Bye.

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:41.684
-Keep me posted, Reporter Choi.
-Okay.

00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:06.209
So you gulped down the scoop
sent to the Entertainment Team.

00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:10.296
And you avoided me because you hated
the thought of me finding out?

00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:13.841
Why would I hate you?
You know I love you so much.

00:19:15.718 --> 00:19:18.179
I didn't say anything
so the manager wouldn't be in trouble.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:20.932
What do you mean?

00:19:21.015 --> 00:19:23.518
I reported it to Department Manager.

00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:27.689
And she told me not to publish it,
very seriously.

00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.359
Don't accuse me.

00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:34.487
I didn't know that you, Seo Ji-woo,
and Cho Jin-eon were involved.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.823
She probably stopped me because she knew,

00:19:36.906 --> 00:19:40.076
but if a reporter ignores a report,
that would be media corruption.

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:42.412
What did I do so wrong?
Taking the exclusive all to myself?

00:19:42.495 --> 00:19:45.832
Let's be honest. If you received it,
you would've just killed it.

00:19:49.168 --> 00:19:51.129
She told you not to write about it?

00:19:52.422 --> 00:19:53.339
Happy now?

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.301
So stop harassing me. Can I go now?

00:19:57.802 --> 00:20:00.221
Sit down. We've only started.
You can't go anywhere.

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:01.431
What is it now?

00:20:01.514 --> 00:20:03.558
You need a follow-up article.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.480
All right. Focus. If that report triggered

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:14.360
an even more vicious setup,
would you be free from it?

00:20:14.444 --> 00:20:17.280
Why are you scaring me? Trigger what?

00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:21.325
I can't explain right now.
First, go meet An Da-hye with me.

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:23.077
An is looking for you, so you request it.

00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:25.830
Are you telling me to meet An?
Are you crazy?

00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:33.171
-Why are you surprised?
-Doo-jin is following up on An Da-hye.

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:38.384
I don't know what it is, but don't.
Don't do it.

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:42.972
If you tell me not to do it, I won't.
Please excuse me.

00:20:43.056 --> 00:20:44.182
Damn it.

00:20:47.101 --> 00:20:48.269
What's he talking about?

00:20:49.187 --> 00:20:50.271
Is that yours?

00:20:51.606 --> 00:20:53.691
I will report it to you when ready.

00:20:58.321 --> 00:21:00.823
-Did you tell him not to write about it?
-Write what?

00:21:01.741 --> 00:21:04.494
You know, that article about Cho Jin-eon.

00:21:05.328 --> 00:21:07.163
Get out of my way. I don't remember.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:13.002
She's so loyal.

00:21:13.878 --> 00:21:16.589
Department Manager is clearly an F.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.550
There goes the big F.

00:21:22.762 --> 00:21:24.472
I did it because you asked.

00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:26.891
But you're not going to leave it here,
are you, Ji-woo?

00:21:26.974 --> 00:21:30.645
Woo-sik. Did you know
Kyeong-do was the ace in the Culture Team?

00:21:31.771 --> 00:21:33.523
I know he was in the Culture Team.

00:21:34.774 --> 00:21:38.653
A masterpiece like this
should be in the ace's house.

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:40.279
Don't you think, Se-yeong?

00:21:40.738 --> 00:21:43.157
For a masterpiece like this, I think so.

00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:49.080
My blood sugar's dropping.
Is meat coming? Where's Kyeong-do?

00:21:49.163 --> 00:21:52.041
I don't know.
Why don't you have that first?

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:53.042
It's for Dong-won.

00:21:53.543 --> 00:21:56.379
If it's chosen by Ji-woo,
it must be luxurious and delicious.

00:21:57.922 --> 00:22:00.633
The meat is coming. Wait for it.

00:22:00.716 --> 00:22:01.968
-Yes, ma'am.
-So cute.

00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:04.220
-Thank you.
-What is it?

00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:05.972
Leave it for the dessert.

00:22:09.934 --> 00:22:11.310
Jeong-min.

00:22:12.103 --> 00:22:14.063
Mother. Give that to me. Here.

00:22:14.147 --> 00:22:16.357
-It's not heavy.
-Give it to me.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.818
Kyeong-do is late
when he's the one who invited everyone.

00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:20.069
Is he not home yet?

00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:22.947
He asked for kimchi
because you guys were coming.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.199
He said he'd come pick it up,
but he's late.

00:22:25.867 --> 00:22:28.077
So his old and busy mom had to bring it.

00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:32.373
No. I think he's late on purpose
so he can invite you in too.

00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:35.209
So you can see us after a long time.
He's so thoughtful.

00:22:35.293 --> 00:22:37.128
Goodness.

00:22:37.712 --> 00:22:41.549
Just have fun between you guys.
I don't want to make him a mama's boy.

00:22:41.632 --> 00:22:44.635
Kyeong-do's dream is to be a mama's boy.
Come with me.

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:46.929
-No, nonsense.
-Come on.

00:22:47.013 --> 00:22:48.639
You go and have fun.

00:22:48.723 --> 00:22:50.183
-But--
-Bye.

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:51.350
But…

00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:53.895
Thank you for this! Bye.

00:22:54.979 --> 00:22:55.897
What's that?

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.691
Kyeong-do's mother gave it to me.
It's kimchi.

00:22:58.774 --> 00:22:59.984
She said he isn't home yet.

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:02.069
-No.
-What are we doing here without…

00:23:05.031 --> 00:23:07.074
Wait a minute. What is this?

00:23:07.783 --> 00:23:09.285
Wait, Ji-woo, isn't that--

00:23:09.368 --> 00:23:11.621
Isn't the top-tier painting different?

00:23:11.704 --> 00:23:13.873
Why are you wasting your talent like this?

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.249
Why don't you paint me instead?

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:18.044
I only soak my brushes
when the money's wired to me.

00:23:18.127 --> 00:23:19.128
That's right.

00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:22.548
I wonder how much Ji-woo wired.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.676
Where did she go?

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.594
What the…

00:23:27.178 --> 00:23:28.429
-Where is she?
-Ji-woo.

00:23:29.013 --> 00:23:30.598
Are you in the bathroom?

00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:44.195
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

00:23:58.292 --> 00:23:59.919
Are you here for laundry pickup?

00:24:07.134 --> 00:24:08.427
Hello.

00:24:25.444 --> 00:24:28.239
The takeout food is still warm.
It looks good.

00:24:28.322 --> 00:24:29.448
Where did Ji-woo go?

00:24:30.157 --> 00:24:32.410
Over there. Looking elegant.

00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:35.830
She'll be back soon. I guess she went out
to buy something. Just eat.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.623
I'm hungry.

00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:44.797
It's good.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.590
I bet you bought it because it's good.

00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:50.052
Why is he sour?

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:51.512
Stop it.

00:24:51.595 --> 00:24:53.681
Hey, face it. Isn't that comedy?

00:24:53.764 --> 00:24:56.017
Do you really want to keep that
in your house?

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.522
A person usually only looks better
in person or in a picture.

00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:04.900
But she looks impeccable
both in person and in the picture.

00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:08.446
And when she's painted, she becomes art.

00:25:09.196 --> 00:25:10.656
Isn't that rare?

00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:18.956
This is so good. Aren't you eating?
Then I'm eating it all.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.791
A bastard like him is rare as well.

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:21.709
Whatever.

00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:25.004
-Is it good?
-Let's eat.

00:25:25.713 --> 00:25:27.006
This is good!

00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:53.866
Well…

00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:57.620
-In a department store…
-Yes, a department store.

00:25:57.703 --> 00:25:59.246
On the basement floor there…

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.875
-The basement. You mean the food section?
-Yes.

00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:05.878
There are so many pretty things to eat.

00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:07.797
Yes, there are a lot.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.843
Nowadays, I guess everyone has skills.
What looks good also tastes good.

00:26:13.511 --> 00:26:16.972
I always wondered
if it'd taste as good as it looked.

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:19.558
When I tried one, it was delicious.

00:26:19.642 --> 00:26:22.186
That's probably
why department stores sell them.

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:25.439
Yeah, the desserts are very nice
these days.

00:26:26.107 --> 00:26:29.777
Some of them are as expensive
as a whole meal.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.612
Some are more expensive than jjajangmyeon.

00:26:32.988 --> 00:26:36.325
Things like these
also require a lot of work.

00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:40.371
It's not easy to bake things.

00:26:41.038 --> 00:26:45.668
When I was debating
between a laundromat and a bakery,

00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:49.713
I tried to learn baking,
I couldn't do it. It was so hard.

00:26:50.506 --> 00:26:54.427
I heard kneading the dough is very hard…

00:26:55.344 --> 00:26:56.720
-That's what I've heard.
-Yes.

00:27:04.603 --> 00:27:07.148
Kyeong-do is probably looking for you.
You should go now.

00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:09.733
Oh, well, Mothe…

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.196
Well…

00:27:16.198 --> 00:27:20.369
I'm not sure how to address you.

00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:22.746
-Me?
-Yes.

00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:26.041
Well, in a drama,

00:27:27.835 --> 00:27:30.838
if someone they don't like
calls them "Mother,"

00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:33.799
they go, "I'm not your Mother."

00:27:35.342 --> 00:27:36.802
I've seen that before.

00:27:37.511 --> 00:27:39.472
It'd be funny to call me Mrs. Jo.

00:27:45.394 --> 00:27:48.898
Se-yeong and the other boys
all call me Mother.

00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:52.693
Just feel free.
I'll drop the honorifics too.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.404
Thank you.

00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:59.658
It's not like I don't like you.

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:13.923
Goodness.

00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:19.553
I should give the rest
to Kyeong-do's father.

00:28:19.637 --> 00:28:21.555
I'll buy you more next time.

00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:24.600
All the delicious stuff
on the department store basement floor.

00:28:24.683 --> 00:28:26.560
The ones that look pretty.

00:28:30.564 --> 00:28:33.484
Well… Mother.

00:28:36.987 --> 00:28:39.573
Well, I…

00:28:40.824 --> 00:28:42.993
happened to meet Kyeong-do again

00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:45.454
after many events.

00:28:47.998 --> 00:28:48.832
Well…

00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:53.712
I do have a sense of shame.

00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:56.840
But I can't help it.

00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:02.721
Kyeong-do is right before my eyes.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.560
I can't tell my heart

00:29:09.144 --> 00:29:10.771
not to fall for him.

00:29:13.148 --> 00:29:14.525
I'm sorry.

00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:26.495
That's why couples elope at night.

00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:29.123
They elope
because they have no other choice.

00:29:40.342 --> 00:29:41.635
Let's go.

00:29:41.719 --> 00:29:43.846
I know the shortcut. I'll take you there.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.481
Sorry. I can't hold my laughter…

00:29:57.318 --> 00:30:00.487
How are you two going to clean that up?
We'll help.

00:30:00.571 --> 00:30:02.072
Not two. Only one idiot will do it.

00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:05.034
Honey, paint Jeong-min too.
This will go on for ten years.

00:30:05.117 --> 00:30:06.577
Send me the money. Bye.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.579
-Congratulations on your first day.
-Congrats!

00:30:08.662 --> 00:30:10.581
I thought we already celebrated
her first day.

00:30:10.664 --> 00:30:14.460
Why don't you just sleep over?
Why don't you just get it off your chest?

00:30:14.543 --> 00:30:17.546
-Hey, can't you read the room?
-Seriously.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.923
Jeez, you idiot. Seriously.
Leave now. Bye.

00:30:20.007 --> 00:30:21.050
He told me to stay.

00:30:21.133 --> 00:30:23.093
-Forget it.
-Put your shoes on.

00:30:23.177 --> 00:30:25.429
-You can sleep on the street. Now, go.
-This way.

00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:27.389
Let's go. Good night!

00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:30.768
The earth finally became quiet.

00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:34.730
Oh, gosh…

00:30:34.813 --> 00:30:36.357
Sit down and get some rest.

00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:38.442
-Can I?
-Yeah.

00:30:45.449 --> 00:30:46.909
What did you do with my mom?

00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:49.953
Wait, how did you know?

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:53.666
Where else would you go
with Dong-won's cupcakes?

00:30:53.749 --> 00:30:57.878
You are a reporter after all. What a pro.

00:30:58.837 --> 00:31:00.005
So what did you do?

00:31:02.383 --> 00:31:06.261
We had the cupcakes, we talked a little,

00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:07.930
and she walked me here.

00:31:08.013 --> 00:31:09.098
Talked about what?

00:31:09.181 --> 00:31:12.476
About the desserts
on the department store basement floor.

00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:18.857
Your mother and I
have the same sense of humor.

00:31:33.163 --> 00:31:35.666
I have a very important meeting tomorrow.

00:31:36.542 --> 00:31:39.878
-All the scary executives will be there.
-What's on the agenda?

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:42.506
Getting rid of MANZAAR.

00:31:43.924 --> 00:31:44.925
MANZAAR?

00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:52.516
MANZAAR is the symbol of JARIM,
Director Seo.

00:31:53.142 --> 00:31:55.769
You know the former chairman cherished it.

00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:58.814
Yes, I'm well aware.

00:31:59.523 --> 00:32:04.027
But we need to face
that the sales are declining every year.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.697
Yet we're relying on the outlets.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.451
And in the past couple of years,
we've been relying on the home shopping.

00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:17.082
Do you also agree with it, Ms. Seo?

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:27.593
Does getting rid of MANZAAR…

00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:32.097
sound like erasing Dad?

00:32:34.308 --> 00:32:35.684
It's a little…

00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:38.395
It kind of feels that way.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.033
If you say it's wrong, I won't do it.

00:32:52.493 --> 00:32:55.788
You are the one in charge of
JARIM's 2nd generation after all.

00:32:57.164 --> 00:32:59.708
If… you're not comfortable with it,

00:33:01.001 --> 00:33:02.127
I won't cause trouble.

00:33:07.466 --> 00:33:12.262
I guess Dad wanted to see
this side of you, Ji-woo.

00:33:13.847 --> 00:33:17.684
Not tied down, direct, and bold.

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:24.608
Let's get into trouble.

00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:30.072
I'm proposing that we launch
a fine-dining restaurant.

00:33:30.155 --> 00:33:33.492
Korea also should have
a homegrown high-end luxury brand,

00:33:33.575 --> 00:33:37.204
and JARIM is in the position
to lead that initiative.

00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:42.209
A high-end luxury brand?

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:46.129
That will require a lot of time
and budget.

00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:47.923
That's right.

00:33:48.632 --> 00:33:51.510
Even if we start now,

00:33:51.593 --> 00:33:53.804
it won't be guaranteed until I turn 60.

00:33:54.346 --> 00:33:57.558
But if we scout a renowned designer,
I think we have a chance.

00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:01.019
Well,

00:34:02.437 --> 00:34:05.190
you should suggest something realistic.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.031
I understand it's unfamiliar
and that you feel anxious.

00:34:13.115 --> 00:34:16.577
Because I've only started,
I might not be on track and make a fu…

00:34:20.205 --> 00:34:22.457
My suggestions may sound unrealistic.

00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:26.086
I'll come up with a detailed suggestion.

00:34:34.344 --> 00:34:35.596
Detailed…

00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:47.441
Good luck.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.569
Thank you.

00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:02.122
Nothing in particular.

00:35:02.915 --> 00:35:04.708
If you take the medicine regularly,

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.961
you won't have to worry
even in the long run.

00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:13.592
Is the new medicine more effective?

00:35:14.217 --> 00:35:18.847
The Didroxin I'd prescribed before
wasn't less effective.

00:35:18.931 --> 00:35:20.807
But there was a side-effect issue.

00:35:22.059 --> 00:35:25.854
My husband told me about it,
but I wasn't paying attention.

00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:29.775
What kind of side effects
were you worried about?

00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:33.695
As it began to damage
the central nervous system,

00:35:33.779 --> 00:35:35.739
I suggested changing the medicine.

00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:37.366
I think

00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:41.036
you were on a business trip abroad,
so you weren't able to come.

00:35:42.371 --> 00:35:43.872
Yes. I remember.

00:35:44.414 --> 00:35:48.877
Fortunately, it was noticed early enough
and it was still recoverable.

00:35:49.461 --> 00:35:52.756
But if you had continued,
it would've led to Alzheimer's.

00:35:57.511 --> 00:35:58.553
Fortunately…

00:36:00.138 --> 00:36:02.891
Then I'll book you in
for six months later.

00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:05.519
Thank you.

00:36:08.188 --> 00:36:09.648
-Doctor.
-Yeah?

00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:12.901
What if I kept taking
a lot more of that drug?

00:36:13.527 --> 00:36:15.028
Is it impossible to recover?

00:36:15.904 --> 00:36:20.701
If Alzheimer's disease is already ongoing,
is it recoverable?

00:36:22.077 --> 00:36:26.081
If you're aware of it and stop taking it,
it won't get worse.

00:36:26.164 --> 00:36:29.793
And it'd still be in the early stages,
so you don't need to worry.

00:36:31.878 --> 00:36:33.839
Are you still anxious?

00:36:35.966 --> 00:36:38.885
Then do you want me to book an exam?

00:36:39.928 --> 00:36:40.762
No.

00:36:41.638 --> 00:36:45.517
When I think about it, it's scary.

00:36:46.727 --> 00:36:47.936
Thank you.

00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:57.070
Hey, look at this.

00:36:57.154 --> 00:37:00.490
This is a list of designers
who are currently in the business…

00:37:02.784 --> 00:37:04.202
What is that attitude?

00:37:05.287 --> 00:37:09.541
MANZAAR was your father's favorite line.
How can you get rid of MANZAAR?

00:37:09.624 --> 00:37:12.419
Gosh, I hear that so much, seriously.

00:37:12.502 --> 00:37:14.212
You bloodless, tearless jerk.

00:37:15.047 --> 00:37:16.840
Whatever. Look at this.

00:37:18.592 --> 00:37:19.468
DESIGNER PROFILE

00:37:19.551 --> 00:37:22.387
This is Lucas. He's leaving this brand
after this S/S season.

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:25.265
So you're going to scout that grandpa?

00:37:25.348 --> 00:37:27.893
This old man is too much of a big shot.
So instead,

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:28.935
this person.

00:37:30.145 --> 00:37:31.188
His successor?

00:37:31.271 --> 00:37:34.274
Lucas has two senior designers
and Bella Jin is one of them.

00:37:34.357 --> 00:37:35.984
She's the successor nominee.

00:37:36.068 --> 00:37:38.320
If she's a nominee,
then it's probably too late.

00:37:39.446 --> 00:37:42.574
She's Korean.
Though she's an Australian citizen.

00:37:42.657 --> 00:37:45.744
If we appeal to her with patriotism…

00:37:45.827 --> 00:37:48.455
Don't induce patriotism in everything.

00:37:48.538 --> 00:37:53.168
Besides, if a Korean designer
became a lead designer of Pirco,

00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:54.169
that also means a lot.

00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:01.802
Can you call yourself a reporter
with that attitude?

00:38:01.885 --> 00:38:05.097
Dongwoon Daily is hopeless.
Their assistant manager is idle.

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:07.849
-How can you get an exclusive?
-Good point.

00:38:08.683 --> 00:38:12.646
Bella Jin or Lucas, what does that have to
do with a Dongwoon Daily reporter?

00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:14.147
Let's order some fried chicken.

00:38:14.231 --> 00:38:18.360
You know, that article with Chaos
to prove our dating rumor was groundless…

00:38:18.985 --> 00:38:20.737
You didn't read the article.

00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:23.115
I never used any cowardly word
like "groundless."

00:38:23.198 --> 00:38:24.282
Yeah, whatever.

00:38:24.825 --> 00:38:29.162
Anyway, the editor-in-chief
at your fashion magazine. Do you know her?

00:38:30.831 --> 00:38:33.375
Let's just order fried chicken.
I don't work for you.

00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:35.502
Your discipline is slipping, soldier.

00:38:35.585 --> 00:38:37.420
Ji-woo, have you ever served in the army?

00:38:38.922 --> 00:38:42.259
All major fashion figures will be
in Samseong-dong next week.

00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:44.803
I have to be there.
Bella Jin might be there.

00:38:44.886 --> 00:38:48.265
Then say you're a resident and join them.
I'm hungry!

00:38:48.348 --> 00:38:52.978
How can I say I'm a resident
and go in there? Jesus.

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:07.659
That's a relief.

00:39:07.742 --> 00:39:12.372
It's not going to get any worse.
So I'm not going to tell Ji-woo.

00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:15.709
Don't you think that's the reason
why you could tell Ji-woo--

00:39:15.792 --> 00:39:18.336
Ji-woo is working on an important project.

00:39:19.254 --> 00:39:22.048
This might be just in my head,
but I feel better these days.

00:39:23.675 --> 00:39:26.803
Maybe later, when Ji-woo's not too busy.
Maybe then.

00:39:27.804 --> 00:39:32.267
Good sleep will help you recover.
I read it in some paper.

00:39:33.935 --> 00:39:36.021
I know it sounds too obvious,

00:39:36.104 --> 00:39:38.523
but you need to recover perfectly soon.

00:39:39.566 --> 00:39:42.819
You should have a good night's sleep.

00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:45.322
Yes.

00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:48.742
You're welcome. Bye.

00:39:55.624 --> 00:39:58.084
-Is someone sick?
-My goodness. Damn it.

00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:01.379
Quit it. You're going to get sick.

00:40:01.463 --> 00:40:03.757
Hey, you know Kim Ga-eul,
the editor-in-chief?

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.717
I wouldn't know. I've never met her.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.637
She collaborated with the manager, not me.
So I don't know her.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.225
I knew that you wouldn't know.
Don't be so arrogant when you don't know.

00:40:13.808 --> 00:40:15.477
I knew you were never helpful, jeez.

00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:19.564
When the luxury brands staff gather,
you know?

00:40:19.648 --> 00:40:23.568
It's best to follow Kim Ga-eul
for the luxury brand business prospect.

00:40:27.656 --> 00:40:28.990
I have Han-kyeong.

00:40:30.283 --> 00:40:32.077
I must've gone crazy.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.496
Why am I discussing this with you
and not Han-Kyeong?

00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:42.087
Lee Kyeong-do, did you pee your pants?

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.296
Stomachache?

00:40:44.798 --> 00:40:45.882
Unbelievable.

00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:48.802
The article on Louis went well
thanks to Ji-woo, no?

00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:50.679
Yes. So what?

00:40:50.762 --> 00:40:53.306
She needs our help,
so we should cooperate.

00:40:54.307 --> 00:40:55.600
You mean you, not we.

00:40:55.684 --> 00:40:59.729
I mean, is this how we work?

00:40:59.813 --> 00:41:02.732
When we've received help,
we should at least return the favor.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.236
Seriously, I'm so sick of it…

00:41:06.903 --> 00:41:07.904
What do you want?

00:41:09.072 --> 00:41:10.532
Well, first of all…

00:41:15.787 --> 00:41:18.415
First of all, what?

00:41:19.749 --> 00:41:21.543
Hey, check this out.

00:41:21.626 --> 00:41:22.502
2025 NEW SCOOTER, WHITE

00:41:22.585 --> 00:41:24.337
That one. Hey, that's pretty.

00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:25.463
A whole different level.

00:41:25.547 --> 00:41:27.299
White is the safe color. Let's get this.

00:41:28.049 --> 00:41:28.925
Are you really paying?

00:41:29.009 --> 00:41:31.678
You barely make anything
after paying for the rental.

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:34.139
But still. This is too expensive.
Don't do it.

00:41:34.222 --> 00:41:36.558
You need confidence
in the world of delivery.

00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:38.560
With this, no one will dare to touch you.

00:41:38.643 --> 00:41:39.769
No one comes at me even now.

00:41:39.853 --> 00:41:43.356
For goodness' sake. So it's a no?
You don't want it?

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.233
White. White is pretty.

00:41:45.984 --> 00:41:48.903
White is pretty, right?
It's an investment.

00:41:48.987 --> 00:41:51.823
If you thrive later,
you have to hire me as a manager.

00:41:52.866 --> 00:41:55.452
You're quite good
at the entertainment business.

00:41:55.535 --> 00:41:57.495
It's a very good investment, CEO Lee.

00:41:57.579 --> 00:41:59.622
It's all thanks to you, Actor Cha.

00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:04.961
-You must do well, okay?
-Thank you, sir!

00:42:07.047 --> 00:42:09.382
Why did you meet my corporate lawyers?

00:42:10.592 --> 00:42:12.927
I met them for legal advice.

00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:16.806
What for? All the noise has been settled.
Are you in trouble again?

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.061
Oh, no, that's not it.
I've only been exercising and staying low.

00:42:21.853 --> 00:42:23.980
Then what's the problem?

00:42:24.064 --> 00:42:28.985
You need to be honest with me
so I can help you settle it!

00:42:33.114 --> 00:42:34.532
Father, I…

00:42:36.785 --> 00:42:39.579
Father. I want to get back with Ji-woo.

00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:41.289
You should've behaved then.

00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:47.796
But why do you need legal advice for that?
Just go beg on your knees.

00:42:48.421 --> 00:42:50.340
Well, I was…

00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:53.802
I was asking
if I could cancel the divorce.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:54.719
Cancel it?

00:42:54.803 --> 00:42:57.555
Yes, Father, this is so unfair.

00:42:57.639 --> 00:43:00.392
She wanted a divorce,
and set me up with her affair partner…

00:43:02.977 --> 00:43:05.230
An affair partner?

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:06.481
-No, it's--
-An affair?

00:43:06.564 --> 00:43:07.941
No, Father.

00:43:11.528 --> 00:43:14.406
Lucas's successor might not be Bella Jin?

00:43:15.073 --> 00:43:18.284
All right. The designer whom Lucas trusts
is indeed Bella Jin.

00:43:18.368 --> 00:43:22.789
But the rumor says the owner is eyeing
Judy Wong more than Bella Jin.

00:43:23.957 --> 00:43:26.292
Only someone like me
can find information like this--

00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:29.712
How is that possible?
I heard Bella Jin was more competent.

00:43:31.005 --> 00:43:33.216
Then who's coming to the event?
Did you secure the list?

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:36.469
How can I do that?
I got this information because it's me--

00:43:36.553 --> 00:43:37.554
Is Bella Jin coming?

00:43:40.014 --> 00:43:41.683
-She's not coming for sure.
-Why not?

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:43.560
On vacation. She's in Málaga.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.354
Málaga… Where is that?

00:43:46.438 --> 00:43:50.483
In Spain. That's where she goes
for her vacation every year.

00:43:50.567 --> 00:43:54.279
And she only stays in the same place.
My editor-in-chief went there once before.

00:43:54.737 --> 00:43:55.738
Anyway, she's there.

00:43:56.865 --> 00:43:57.824
Where in Málaga?

00:43:57.907 --> 00:43:59.826
-I wouldn't know.
-You have to know.

00:44:04.956 --> 00:44:07.709
The editor-in-chief doesn't know
the address either.

00:44:08.376 --> 00:44:10.503
It's on the top floor
of a five-story building.

00:44:10.587 --> 00:44:14.466
She walked up a spiraling staircase,
and the first floor was an ice cream shop.

00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:16.259
Ice cream…

00:44:22.015 --> 00:44:24.809
Why are you rolling your eyes?
You're scaring me.

00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:30.064
-What are you doing?
-Don't talk to me. I can't multitask.

00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:32.734
I found it. Give me your passport.

00:44:33.735 --> 00:44:35.236
Why do you need my passport?

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.488
To meet Bella Jin.

00:44:38.072 --> 00:44:41.117
Am I going alone?
That far? So lonely and forlorn?

00:44:43.786 --> 00:44:45.580
What about my own schedule?

00:44:45.663 --> 00:44:48.082
I'm the son of Dongwoon,
Assistant Manager Lee.

00:44:53.338 --> 00:44:57.675
He's absent today,
and he took four days off.

00:44:57.759 --> 00:44:59.844
Shall I look up Seo Ji-woo's schedule?

00:45:00.845 --> 00:45:02.764
Does he think he's a fashion person?

00:45:02.847 --> 00:45:04.516
I am a fashion person, right?

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:08.186
He used his precious vacation days?
Has he left already?

00:45:08.269 --> 00:45:10.813
If he's going away for six days,
he must be going abroad.

00:45:12.815 --> 00:45:13.650
What?

00:45:13.733 --> 00:45:15.527
Who am I talking to?

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.655
What are you having for lunch?
I want malatang.

00:45:18.738 --> 00:45:20.198
You said you wanted pasta earlier.

00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:23.910
Let's have Chinese food.
Sorry, all, let's have Chinese food.

00:45:23.993 --> 00:45:25.995
Seriously, why did he have to leave…

00:45:27.288 --> 00:45:30.041
Reporter Choi,
find a delicious Chinese restaurant

00:45:30.959 --> 00:45:32.335
that makes good malatang.

00:45:32.835 --> 00:45:37.173
Hey, think about quitting
and working as Ji-woo's secretary.

00:45:38.675 --> 00:45:41.719
You know the saying,
"Saving turns things into poop"?

00:45:41.803 --> 00:45:44.430
I saved my vacation days
only to waste them on this.

00:45:48.893 --> 00:45:51.479
Have you heard the phrase,
"smiling bastard"?

00:45:51.563 --> 00:45:53.314
That probably means her, right?

00:45:54.482 --> 00:45:56.609
She's not that annoying.

00:45:57.777 --> 00:45:59.320
You haven't met a real bastard yet.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.698
Nothing.

00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:04.409
Yeah, let's go.

00:46:05.326 --> 00:46:06.286
Have a good trip.

00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:15.878
DIRECTOR KANG MIN-WOO

00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:19.215
Are they ever going to grow up?

00:46:20.466 --> 00:46:22.260
Shouldn't a reporter know better?

00:47:04.302 --> 00:47:07.096
I see why Bella Jin comes here
for vacation every year.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.099
About Bella Jin,

00:47:10.975 --> 00:47:13.770
since she's vacationing
in a beautiful place like this,

00:47:13.853 --> 00:47:15.688
she'd fall for my offer, right?

00:47:32.914 --> 00:47:34.707
Is someone coming from the hotel?

00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:37.502
Wouldn't it be faster if we went?

00:47:37.919 --> 00:47:39.379
I think she's nearby.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.468
Here.

00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:46.719
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:47:47.512 --> 00:47:48.429
Hello.

00:47:48.846 --> 00:47:50.556
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.933
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:48:02.151 --> 00:48:04.320
If we're staying at the host's house…

00:48:04.404 --> 00:48:06.072
There's no hotel around here.

00:48:06.155 --> 00:48:09.617
I searched for a place to stay
near Bella Jin until my eyes were sore.

00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:12.120
You know?
It's not easy to find accommodation.

00:48:12.745 --> 00:48:15.957
But I don't have any good memories
with accommodations found like this.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.377
Maybe when you booked it.
This is about discernment.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:23.381
I'll let you have breakfast
on the sea-view terrace. It's awesome.

00:48:26.217 --> 00:48:29.303
An alley like this wouldn't give an angle
for a sea view.

00:48:38.438 --> 00:48:40.440
Honey, they are here.

00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:44.485
Hello.

00:48:45.486 --> 00:48:46.863
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:49:11.179 --> 00:49:13.431
You can get ahead of yourself
internationally.

00:49:13.973 --> 00:49:17.185
I'm not. You can see the sea.
What else I'm supposed to say?

00:49:17.935 --> 00:49:20.021
Right. We're not here for the sea view.

00:49:20.104 --> 00:49:21.105
We're here for Bella Jin.

00:49:33.493 --> 00:49:34.911
Do you want to go here?

00:49:39.665 --> 00:49:40.792
Where is it?

00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:42.960
We're on this side.

00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:46.631
"Amore Gelato…" That's down here…

00:49:46.714 --> 00:49:48.508
-Do you see this?
-Around here?

00:49:48.591 --> 00:49:49.425
Yeah.

00:50:05.525 --> 00:50:06.484
Let's try that way.

00:50:11.614 --> 00:50:12.865
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:50:14.492 --> 00:50:15.576
It's a three-story.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.662
-Do you want to get something? Come on.
-But…

00:50:25.127 --> 00:50:26.838
It's a five-story.

00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:33.636
Stay here. Your legs will get tired.

00:50:49.235 --> 00:50:50.319
Is this the one?

00:50:50.862 --> 00:50:52.655
It's just a house, not an accommodation.

00:50:55.032 --> 00:50:58.035
Go wait at a cafe somewhere.
I'll look for it. It shouldn't take long.

00:50:58.786 --> 00:51:00.121
I'd be dead from waiting.

00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:02.999
You'll carry me if I got too tired.

00:51:03.082 --> 00:51:04.458
That'd be too much.

00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:20.766
-A gelato shop.
-What?

00:51:25.605 --> 00:51:26.522
Five stories too.

00:51:26.606 --> 00:51:28.441
I'm getting a good feeling about it.

00:51:28.524 --> 00:51:29.734
Sit here. I'll go check.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.834
Is this the one?

00:51:51.422 --> 00:51:52.423
This is the one.

00:51:53.466 --> 00:51:55.176
-Where is Bella Jin?
-Wait.

00:51:55.259 --> 00:51:57.428
She went to Barcelona.
She'll be back tomorrow.

00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:03.267
I gave my number to the landlord.
She'll call us when she's back.

00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:04.185
Okay…

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.022
-She'll be back tomorrow, right?
-What?

00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:09.732
-Holy shit.
-What is it?

00:52:09.815 --> 00:52:11.233
This is the same as the play.

00:52:11.317 --> 00:52:15.237
"Mr. Godot will surely come tomorrow."
But he never comes, and the play ends--

00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:16.489
Calm down.

00:52:20.159 --> 00:52:23.996
Bella Jin won't come tonight.
But surely tomorrow.

00:52:24.914 --> 00:52:27.583
Let's believe it. Who knows?
She might come tonight.

00:52:31.045 --> 00:52:33.798
Then what are we doing today?

00:52:33.881 --> 00:52:36.926
We'll check out Málaga.
We're tourists today. Okay?

00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:39.887
But what if she doesn't--

00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:41.639
Seriously. Let's go.

00:52:42.515 --> 00:52:44.558
We found this building. Okay?

00:52:44.642 --> 00:52:45.559
That's true.

00:52:45.643 --> 00:52:46.602
Shall we eat first?

00:52:46.686 --> 00:52:47.979
-Yes.
-Let's go.

00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:52.191
Let's come here again for vacation later.

00:52:53.401 --> 00:52:54.860
Depending on where we're staying.

00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:58.239
How many times did I tell you?
It was the closest to Bella Jin's--

00:52:58.322 --> 00:53:00.157
I'm sure there was a better one.

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.787
You know my real intention.

00:53:05.496 --> 00:53:08.874
Stop bullshitting.
So what is your real intention?

00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:13.045
The place we're staying might feel tight.

00:53:13.129 --> 00:53:14.922
But on the other hand, it's cozy.

00:53:15.464 --> 00:53:19.176
Exotic coziness.
The bed is also big. It's a double bed.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.929
If I fall while turning,
I'd get a fracture.

00:53:22.013 --> 00:53:25.808
There was a time when a single bed
was enough for both of us, you woman.

00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:51.542
What do we do now?

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.211
Picasso's birthplace is here.

00:53:54.295 --> 00:53:55.504
Are we on a school trip?

00:53:56.547 --> 00:54:01.177
If we have a beer now… It'd be perfect.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.474
-Eat this.
-I've had enough. Too sweet.

00:54:09.685 --> 00:54:12.146
Don't you ever crave alcohol?

00:54:13.314 --> 00:54:16.984
It's not that I don't think about it.
The taste you know is the scariest.

00:54:18.402 --> 00:54:19.904
I'd just suppress it until I die.

00:54:26.744 --> 00:54:27.578
I can do it.

00:54:29.955 --> 00:54:33.167
Even if it is scary,
if you suppress it, I'll do it too.

00:54:42.301 --> 00:54:43.219
Let's go.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:46.889
What do you want to do?

00:54:47.598 --> 00:54:48.808
There is Picasso's birthplace.

00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:51.852
No, only high schoolers go there.

00:54:53.896 --> 00:54:56.816
Those two assholes are having
a secret affair abroad?

00:54:57.691 --> 00:55:02.154
And how did you know
and send me the pictures?

00:55:03.906 --> 00:55:07.827
You know… I'm heartbroken.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:10.371
I couldn't just ignore it.

00:55:11.205 --> 00:55:15.376
You couldn't get over Ji-woo and wanted
to get back with her. You sounded sincere.

00:55:16.961 --> 00:55:18.671
But she's living with someone?

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.757
I only dug into her to tell you

00:55:22.716 --> 00:55:25.261
that you were mistaken, but…

00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:27.471
I was right, wasn't I?

00:55:28.013 --> 00:55:29.723
They fucked me up, right?

00:55:31.642 --> 00:55:33.644
What are you going to do?

00:55:34.228 --> 00:55:36.480
I can't take anyone's side. My goodness.

00:55:37.273 --> 00:55:39.692
But, Min-woo, you know what?

00:55:40.818 --> 00:55:43.529
I pity her. Get it?

00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:46.615
When I think about Seo Ji-woo, I pity her.

00:55:48.701 --> 00:55:50.411
My father said

00:55:50.995 --> 00:55:54.874
if I ever mention Seo Ji-woo again,
he won't leave me anything, shit.

00:55:55.416 --> 00:55:58.752
I even knelt down to get back with her.

00:55:58.836 --> 00:56:01.505
Gosh, you are amazing.

00:56:04.133 --> 00:56:06.635
"Why accept her again
when Chairman Seo is dead?"

00:56:07.595 --> 00:56:11.098
"Who knows whose child she is?
I only accepted her for Chairman Seo."

00:56:11.182 --> 00:56:13.809
"Don't you dare bring her back,
you idiot!" He said.

00:56:16.604 --> 00:56:17.605
What are you saying?

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.523
Gosh.

00:56:20.065 --> 00:56:22.568
I guess I really loved her, Min-woo.

00:56:22.651 --> 00:56:23.527
Who?

00:56:24.653 --> 00:56:26.405
He doesn't know who is whose child?

00:56:27.907 --> 00:56:31.118
Her! Seo Ji-woo!

00:56:32.203 --> 00:56:35.539
She's not the daughter of
JARIM Apparel's Chairman Seo Won-seok.

00:56:36.207 --> 00:56:40.419
Her mom had her from an affair.
Can you believe that?

00:56:40.502 --> 00:56:41.754
Shit.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.883
That's nonsense. Shit.

00:57:15.079 --> 00:57:15.913
Let's go.

00:57:19.208 --> 00:57:20.042
That looks fun.

00:57:20.584 --> 00:57:21.418
What?

00:57:22.586 --> 00:57:25.214
A European flea market.
That looks romantic.

00:57:25.297 --> 00:57:26.257
Let's check it out.

00:57:31.011 --> 00:57:32.763
What is that? A ski?

00:57:41.855 --> 00:57:43.357
The cookies look good.

00:57:44.233 --> 00:57:45.192
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:57:45.276 --> 00:57:46.986
I already had two ice creams.

00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:48.153
Right.

00:57:48.237 --> 00:57:50.406
Then go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:51.323
Okay.

00:58:03.877 --> 00:58:06.547
SEO JI-WOO

00:58:13.762 --> 00:58:14.596
It's five euro.

00:58:55.012 --> 00:58:55.846
What?

00:58:57.222 --> 00:58:58.057
What's wrong?

00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:02.269
No, I think I grabbed it first.

00:59:02.353 --> 00:59:04.229
We kind of grabbed it at the same time.

00:59:04.313 --> 00:59:05.147
Wait, this is…

00:59:23.207 --> 00:59:24.291
Ji-woo.

00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:25.751
You said you grabbed it first.

00:59:33.926 --> 00:59:36.595
Ninety-eight limited scarves
according to the two-piece suit.

00:59:40.432 --> 00:59:41.475
You know it.

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:45.354
I used to look down on JARIM,
but you're not bad.

00:59:46.772 --> 00:59:47.773
Who are you?

00:59:53.529 --> 00:59:54.488
Are you

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:56.031
Bella Jin?

01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:23.725
Come on.

01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:28.230
My ace is working his ass off in Málaga.

01:00:29.398 --> 01:00:31.608
He's your ace. Not mine.

01:00:31.692 --> 01:00:32.568
Seriously?

01:00:36.864 --> 01:00:39.992
Your ace. What was his name again?

01:00:41.076 --> 01:00:42.244
Wi-do?

01:00:42.327 --> 01:00:43.745
He had a unique name.

01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:45.330
Kyeong-do.

01:00:45.414 --> 01:00:46.248
Not Wi-do. Kyeong-do.

01:00:46.331 --> 01:00:50.169
Right. Kyeong-do. Kim Kyeong-do.
Which Kim clan?

01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:51.962
It's not Kim. It's Lee.

01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:55.632
Is that so? Is he a Lee? What a relief.

01:00:55.716 --> 01:00:57.926
I get along with the Lees so much.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.221
I had the tarot card reading.
I was told I get along with the Lees.

01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:02.848
He has no double eyelids, right?

01:01:03.849 --> 01:01:05.684
A man with no double eyelids--

01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:07.519
-Hey!
-What?

01:01:07.603 --> 01:01:09.396
Where is Bella Jin?

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:15.444
Honey, how much more
do you expect me to do?

01:01:15.527 --> 01:01:17.362
I told you everything I found.

01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:19.865
That Bella Jin's on vacation
and the location, everything.

01:01:19.948 --> 01:01:23.285
An ice cream shop on the 1st floor
in a five-story building?

01:01:23.368 --> 01:01:25.287
Can you find a person abroad with that?

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.205
You can't?

01:01:27.039 --> 01:01:31.335
You're so brazen.
I told you so much already.

01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:34.046
Hold on.

01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:36.465
Right now, in Spain, it's…

01:01:37.132 --> 01:01:42.137
Hey, Bella Jin can answer her phone.

01:01:43.597 --> 01:01:47.059
Too musty. Stress.

01:01:47.142 --> 01:01:51.396
Hey, do you think
that jacket goes with that shirt?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.025
Just putting on whatever you grab,
you need to fix that first.

01:01:55.108 --> 01:01:58.820
Hey! Stop changing the topic.
I'll make it clear for you.

01:01:59.446 --> 01:02:02.741
Call Bella Jin now.
Give her my ace's number.

01:02:02.824 --> 01:02:04.701
Tell Bella Jin to call him first.

01:02:06.995 --> 01:02:08.664
I should go on with this color.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.630
Seriously,

01:02:16.713 --> 01:02:19.383
I'm a very pure person.

01:02:19.466 --> 01:02:21.927
Getting Bella Jin's location
over a mere friendship.

01:02:27.474 --> 01:02:29.726
If I ever get involved with you again,

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:33.438
I'll either quit this editor-in-chief job
or quit our friendship.

01:02:41.738 --> 01:02:43.615
See? She's not answering.

01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:46.368
How many times do I tell you
that we're not close?

01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:49.288
Oh, my Bella, where are you?

01:02:49.371 --> 01:02:52.165
Did she pick up? Awesome. So shocking.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:54.585
Oh, my. In Barcelona?

01:02:54.668 --> 01:02:56.253
Hey, tell her to go to Málaga.

01:02:57.671 --> 01:03:01.925
My dear Bella, are you in Barcelona?
Isn't that nice?

01:03:02.009 --> 01:03:05.137
Hey, cut to the chase.

01:03:07.556 --> 01:03:09.683
When are you going to Málaga, honey?

01:03:43.342 --> 01:03:44.468
Holding back is a strategy.

01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:46.011
-Are you getting teary?
-Not funny.

01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:49.389
No way she could scout
a luxury brand designer.

01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:52.893
Have you ever liked any other woman?

01:03:53.644 --> 01:03:54.728
I have.

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:57.939
You're groundbreaking in so many ways.

01:03:59.024 --> 01:04:00.567
Then are you moving on?

01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:05.447
How come we've never run into each other?

01:04:06.073 --> 01:04:08.992
Waiting for Godot is over.
Everything is over.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.204
He said he'd come if I waited. Bullshit.

01:04:12.788 --> 01:04:14.498
The curtain's closed.

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:17.751
My Kyeong-do idiot should end it too.
