00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960
Mr. Xing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.480
How many were there with him

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.720
for dinner yesterday?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.960
I wasn't there.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.480
I don't know

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.800
the exact number.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.079
Who else has he been seeing lately?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.400
Lately...

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.240
I know about work contacts,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360
but his personal life,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.240
private affairs,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.720
so to speak,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.920
I'm not in the loop.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.440
Any idea whom

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.200
he was with last?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.480
Whom he was with last...

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.960
[Where's the crisis]

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.120
[management plan?]

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.760
[What am I]

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
[paying you morons for?]

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.280
Officer, to be honest,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.040
I was totally

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.960
taken aback by this tragedy, too.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.720
I was in shock and heartsick.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040
But,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600
I've always known better

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.760
than to pry into

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.200
his private stuffs.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.079
As far as work goes,

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.160
I've emptied the bag to you.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.280
Did he ever

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.440
seem not himself lately?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.280
Not that I remember.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.079
Just yesterday we were

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.120
having a blast together.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.680
Who knew today...

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.079
There's a high-level meeting at the station.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.360
I'm here to go through the preliminary.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.720
Ms. Zhang,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.160
would you like something to drink?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.240
Yes, please.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.920
Let me repeat the question.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.560
Alright.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.480
How specific can you go

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.080
about this accident?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.920
I... was

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.720
in a car on my way home

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.000
when the police called.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.200
I was in the back seat...

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.120
I was... I was in the car.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.560
Then I came over.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.800
I was supposed to be

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.080
on my way home,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.159
But once I...

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.280
got the call,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.720
I came straight here.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.600
Okay, so you came

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.880
after we gave you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.360
a call.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.000
Yes.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.159
Have you and Li Daoqi,

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.400
the deceased,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.840
been in touch lately?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
No... not much lately.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.880
He was a close friend of ours.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.840
We were close.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.200
We hung out a lot.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.760
When did you last speak?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.880
He called me,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.320
the night before last.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.360
What did he say?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.520
He asked me for a costume.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.120
One that

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.520
makes you real goofy,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.640
like a frog.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.600
I didn't give it to him.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.440
Night before last...

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.440
Night before last.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.880
Okay.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.520
He was

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.800
at my... at my place.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.840
I'm sure he was

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.640
when he called.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.840
Because my husband was

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.960
presumably with him.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.560
He was probably hearing.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.440
I'm sure he was.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.280
So Li Daoqi was

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.000
at your place with your husband.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.480
Yes.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.720
He said they were watching

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.680
the football game.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.480
Bought some scratch cards.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.920
Something like that.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.280
That's... that's what he told me.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.360
Okay.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
So your husband

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.760
and Li Daoqi were

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.800
business partners, right?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.640
More than just partners.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.200
They've been

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.720
best friends since they were kids.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.000
Then my husband went overseas,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.680
but they stayed close.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.080
They became half brothers.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.720
In a word,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.080
our family tree is complicated.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720
My husband's father

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.000
and Daoqi's mother

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.040
later got married,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.760
which has

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.880
turned friendship

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.120
into real brotherhood.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.040
Yudong loved him dearly.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.360
So much so that I got

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.040
jealous.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.920
We once had a huge fight

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.760
just because I thought he was

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.080
choosing him over me.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.280
Last question,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.840
bear with me.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.960
On the phone,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.760
or face to face,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.400
did he ever say anything

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.640
about hurting himself?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.440
Any signs of that?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440
Absolutely not.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.320
He called because

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.200
things between

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.800
my husband and I

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.400
have been rocky.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.600
He was trying to

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.840
fix our relationship.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.600
He called to tell me

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.680
reality TV is all fake,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.160
real life is what matters,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.880
and asked for the costume.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.000
That was all.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.600
So he was mediating

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.120
your marital issues?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.120
Yes.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.120
Daoqi had been keen

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.280
to help us work things out.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.720
I...

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.120
I should've

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.720
given him that costume.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.080
Oh, how could I reject him...

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.200
How could I...

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.840
Your husband kept insisting

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.600
that Daoqi's death was his fault.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.040
What's your take on that?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.120
Understood.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.160
So much for today.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.960
Mr. Fu, when did you leave

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.000
Yingmei Center that day?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.000
Can you recall?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.840
Around midnight.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.880
I remember

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.000
the lights there

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.240
had just gone out.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.840
Did you take a taxi?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.000
Do you have a receipt?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.880
No.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.760
I hailed a ride.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.200
Here's the trip history.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.760
From what I gather,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.880
you two

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.920
were very close.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.200
My dad married his mom.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.640
He grew up with a single mom.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.360
So did I.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.200
We were in college together.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.680
No less family

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.040
than friends.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.280
[We used to be neighbors.]

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.120
[His dad died young.]

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.400
[His mom raised him alone.]

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.440
[It was tough back then.]

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
[Got bullied a lot.]

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.760
Stop it! Leave him alone!

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.560
[It's okay. You're safe now.]

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.560
[Stop hitting him, you brats!]

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.880
Yudong.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.360
Then my mother died too.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.160
We had the same scar.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.760
My dad's been very weird.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.400
How so?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.280
Dropped by your place way too often.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.160
What's it

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.000
to do with you?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400
Hey, remember

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.680
my crush

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.440
from your

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:15.960
department?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Turns out she's

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.640
seeing one of my own seniors.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.360
Didn't she use to go for younger guys?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.360
Since when

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.880
was the May-December thing back in style?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.160
Hey, wait up!

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.560
I'm not done.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.240
The wheel of fortune turns.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.240
When will it be my turn?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.440
Look, Yudong,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.400
we should stay out of

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.160
our parents' business.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.240
They're grown-ups,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.960
you know?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.200
They'll have to sort it out.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.440
I'm just working out.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.240
None of their business.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.640
This isn't a workout.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.840
That's self-sabotaging.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.040
You're

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.520
running yourself into the ground.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.480
Look at you,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.000
what's the point in burning these

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.480
calories

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.160
when you know you're buying me

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.560
a decent meal right after?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.480
Speak for yourself.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.440
Dude,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.400
you've always been very slack

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.120
in treating me

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.880
to the fancy meal that I deserve.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.080
Get off me.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.440
What if I won't?

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.440
Sort me out, huh?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.240
Dude, what...

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.800
I'm gonna... a leg for a leg!

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.320
This is stupid.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.040
So stupid!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.600
Now I'm on top.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.480
Hey...

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.560
Pass it!

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.560
Should've taken the shot yourself.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.880
When you had the ball,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.720
you shoot.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.360
I'm the assist king.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.400
I'm a team player.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400
That's my motto.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.920
You know?

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.440
Internet cafe tonight?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.760
My treat.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.840
Can't. Lab work.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.640
Is it worth all this playing janitor

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.520
for the lab rats,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.480
just for a

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.560
darn letter of rec?

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.720
That's crude.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.960
Let me tell you,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.040
getting to scoop poop at Prof. Chen's lab

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.600
is a

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.640
dream gig for us.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.360
Plus,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.960
don't tell my dad

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.200
about me going overseas.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.400
Got it.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.480
Or your mom.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.000
So

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.440
what are you gonna

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.600
bribe me with

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.800
to keep my mouth shut?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.720
How about

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.920
bringing you some

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.920
choice rat droppings from the lab?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.160
Good nibble.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.080
You'll love it.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.200
What?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.560
He's going abroad!

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.720
I don't care.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.680
I don't even know them.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.360
Yell all you want.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.560
You're making yourself stupid.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.040
Keep yelling.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.760
Scream your lungs out.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.360
He's going abroad!

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.080
One more thing.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.960
In your personal opinion,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.800
what happened to Daoqi?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.680
He wouldn't do this.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.760
Look at it.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.920
Stuck in this cage forever,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.840
it's depressed.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.600
It wouldn't move.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.000
Hey, hands off.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.320
What, is it venomous?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.400
They might

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.560
turn into Splinter from TMNT

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.680
and whack you with a stick.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.480
What happens to these

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.200
little buddies

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.520
when you're done with them?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.720
How should I know?

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.680
I don't keep them.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.120
All set. Let's bounce.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.800
- Bye.
- Grab some food.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
Bye, buddies.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.560
Later.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.320
What to eat?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.920
Whatever.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.880
Your call.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.760
Buy me satay noodles.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.720
New place by the gate.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.280
Sure.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.400
You suggested it, you pay.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.360
Man, I waited for you forever.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.320
At least buy me food.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.080
I'm broke.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.600
Scrooge!

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.200
[He was]

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.840
[a really kind soul.]

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.560
[He'd feel sorry]

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.240
[for a lab rat.]

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.160
[So he decided]

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.160
[to set it free.]

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:33.880
[Luckily,]

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.800
[I caught him]

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.520
[before he left the lab.]

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.360
[Otherwise,]

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.320
[it could've been demerits.]

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560
[Someone like that...]

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.120
[I don't believe he killed himself.]

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.360
♪Little eggshell, oh so small,♪

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.120
♪please, oh, please, don't you cry.♪

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.320

♪into my home we'll go.♪

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.000
I think he must have

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.920
slipped by accident.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.520
He'd had so much to drink.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.280
If I had stayed...

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.760
Alright.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.800
That's all for now.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.880
Thank you.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.880
I called you. You didn't pick up.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.440
Phone died.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.119
Did you go in and look?

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.200
Cheng Man did.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.320
Thanks for your help.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.800
That should be everything.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.840
We'll be in touch

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.960
if there are new leads.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.880
The hospital has already notified them.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.480
You should coordinate directly with

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.640
the funeral home.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:39.960
Sorry for your loss.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.960
Thank you.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.560
Farther and Mom went back.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.760
We'll talk about

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.160
the company stuff

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.080
in a couple of days.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.320
For now, please

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.800
keep things under control.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.880
I need to go back.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.840
Nian's waiting for me.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.560
Let us see you off.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.520
Yudong can call you a car.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.400
No need, I drove here.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.880
Man, Yudong isn't good with words.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.880
I know, I know.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.240
Would Daoqi be disappointed

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.400
seeing me like this?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.000
Should I cry like you

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.160
instead?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080
I gotta go.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.640
Honey.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.000
Cheers.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.400
Yudong,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.040
I've figured it out.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.960
Buddha is so good to us.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.240
Think about it.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.760
Buddha has so much

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.560
to deal with every day,

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.360
but he took time out

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.840
to play this joke on us.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.640
He must really love us.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440
I'd rather

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.960
he never thinks of us

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.760
at all.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.160
Come on.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.120
Don't be so negative.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040
Even Tang Sangzang

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.400
went through 81 tribulations

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.000
to get the scriptures.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.800
You remember that story?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.760
In the end, there's one tribulation short.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.360
They were on the giant turtle's back

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.280
when it flipped over.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.320
All the scriptures fell in the water.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.000
They scrambled to

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.800
fish them out and dried them

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.520
on rocks.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.040
When they turned the pages,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.440
a corner went missing.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.240
Even Tang Sangzang was a little upset.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.200
But Sun Wukong,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.000
the Victorious Fighting Buddha,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.720
said nothing in this world

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.280
is ever truly perfect.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.360
Even a monkey understood that.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.600
So what are you worried about?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.480
Buddha must have

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.560
known that Yudong

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.400
and Daoqi

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.280
are

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.400
about

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.600
to succeed.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.280
He said,"Nope,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.600
I gotta throw in one more test."

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.400
Then he looks around,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.040
and Lady Wan

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.640
got arrested.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.480
She was arrested

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.960
just to test us. Can you believe this?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.720
Really,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.800
I feel so guilty.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.560
What did she

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.600
do to deserve this?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.200
[It's all to test us.]

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.120
As they say,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.600
before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.080
he first tests his resolve,

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.240
exhausts his muscles and bones,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.120
starves his body,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.240
leaves him destitute,

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.240
and confounds his every endeavor.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.440
So his patience and endurance are developed,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.560
and his weaknesses are overcome.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.000
From now on, we're about to

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.840
become invincible.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.880
Just now in the bathroom,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.120
I suddenly felt

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.960
Buddha send me

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.640
a brain wave signal.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.720
He said, "Yudong

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.000
and Daoqi, listen up.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.920
I have a big mission

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.840
for you two.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.480
Don't mess it up."

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.640
[W-Who's talking to me?]

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.280
[It scared]

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.720
[the hell out of me.]

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.480
Buddha!

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.040
We got your

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.080
message!

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.280
What is this big mission?

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:09.840
It's fine.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:11.840
It's fine.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.480
[Yudong.]

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.400
[Yudong,]

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.280
[Buddha can't hear]

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.400
[your shouting.]

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.440
[Listen,]

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.800
[today's a good day.]

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.720
[We should celebrate.]

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.600
I mean it.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.760
We should get some firecrackers going.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.720
We got balloons.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.680
[Before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,]

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.960
[he first tries his resolve,]

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.240
[exhausts his muscles and bones,]

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.240
[starves his body,]

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.280
[leaves him destitute,]

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.960
[and confounds his every endeavor.]

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.840
[So his patience and endurance are developed,]

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.200
[and his weaknesses are overcome.]

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.440
[Before Buddha invests a man with great responsibilities,]

[Buddha,]

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.640
a toast to you.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.440
Enough.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.720
You're drunk.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.880
Go home.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.400
Yudong, I used to think

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.680
we'd finally made it.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.360
Turns out

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.960
we're still losers.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.160
[Aren't you afraid of heights?]

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.120
[Get down.]

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.400
Yudong,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.560
sorry.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.480
I'm sorry.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.800
I'm so sorry.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.960
Between us?

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.840
No need for apologies.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.520
Since we were kids, we've

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.200
cleaned up each other's messes.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.520
There's nothing to be sorry about.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.280
Whatever happens,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.920
I've got your back.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.960
Go home, get some sleep.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.280
We need to handle

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.320
a lot of things tomorrow.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:34.800
Let's go.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.160
Go home and have a rest.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.240
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.000
[Go.]

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.680
Why are these steps so high?

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480
Why are you standing there?

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.440
I've got a call.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.200
Could be my mom

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.320
or your dad.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.280
I should call back.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.800
Call them until you're home.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.160
Wanna say a few words to your dad?

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.080
Come on.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.800
No.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.720
Just say something.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.560
I'm not talking to him.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.640
Why is this door trapping me?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.680
Crouch.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.360
Just crouch.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.760
Alright.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.480
Go back soon.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.760
See you tomorrow, Yudong.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280
See you tomorrow.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040
[Why did you come up here?]

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.440
[This area's off-limits.]

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.240
I'm just taking a look.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.000
Two minutes.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.720
Thank you.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.960
[Someone fell from here a few days ago.]

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.040
[It's dangerous. Just get down.]

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.560
Ms. Cheng?

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.360
Ms. Cheng?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.680
Sorry,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.320
I'd like to know

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.040
what happened that day.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.000
Do you remember?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.040
I was on my phone

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.600
and saw the news about Lady Wan.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.480
I knew something

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.560
went wrong.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.840
So I called him right away.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.840
I called so many times

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.400
and sent so many messages.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.320
No answer.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.840
I was so worried

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.720
about him,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.360
and then

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.080
I called

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.440
his office.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.040
His

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.320
assistant picked up

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.080
and said he was inside.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.480
I heard his voice,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.880
and I

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.040
felt so relieved.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.160
I asked him

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.480
if he'd seen the news.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.040
He said yes.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.840
He said it was fine.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.400
I told him

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.160
it had nothing to do with him.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.560
It was a black swan event,

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.000
and he shouldn't overthink it.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.320
Then he said the same thing

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.520
he told me

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.880
when we first met.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.400
What seems like the end of the world today

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.480
will be just a joke in ten years.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.760
He said

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.560
the same words

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.920
when we first met.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.400
I've never forgotten that.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.640
[I'm here now.]

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.000
Where's the coral you mentioned?

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.680
Just rocks everywhere.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.720
Am

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.040
I crazy? Jumping into the sea?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.440
Do you know how cold the water is?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.280
[It doesn't look like cold,]

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.160
[but go in and try it yourself.]

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.360
[You won't last a minute.]

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.920
[The water's cold as ice.]

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.920
I'm fine.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.480
What would I be upset about?

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.600
I'm totally fine.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.320
Just don't take yourself

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.240
too seriously,

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:27.920
and don't take

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.320
others too seriously either.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.920
Things that seem like

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.320
the sky is falling now

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.040
will just be a joke ten years later.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:34.520
Really.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.320
What's that saying again...

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:37.880
Thank you.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.160
I'll hang up now.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.440
I even made a special trip

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.680
to Victoria Harbour.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.440
Honestly?

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.280
Not as impressive as Lucheng Pier.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.560
No way.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.400
I'm serious.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.040
All those Central district buildings

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.480
look huge in movies, right?

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.440
Yeah, all those skyscrapers.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.320
No, no, no.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.440
Not really.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.720
They're not high at all.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.920
They look like

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.120
those miniature city models

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.760
at our Lucheng World Park.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.600
You must be kidding.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.560
I'm not.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.760
This, this.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.400
Right.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.040
Most importantly,

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040
I have to thank Ms. Yan

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.560
for making this outfit for me.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.200
- Really.
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.640
It's amazing.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.880
Custom-made

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.400
for me.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.000
With this outfit on,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.560
you're definitely going to succeed.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.680
Definitely. For sure.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.880
How did your interview go?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.520
Way too smooth.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.440
Think about it,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.680
the moment I walked in

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.040
dressed in this outfit, they froze.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.840
When I talked,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.360
the interviewer

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.480
was impressed.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.520
He wouldn't let me go

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.120
and said, red-eyed,

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:34.920
you should start working today.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.160
I refused and asked him

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.880
to stop pulling

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.760
and let me go.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.920
[So that's why I'm mad.]

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.320
[They gave him the job and he declined.]

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.160
No, I can't take the job.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.040
[What a waste.]

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.280
No.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:42.600
[Exactly.]

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.880
My mom's here.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.960
If I go to Hong Kong,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.680
what about her?

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.760
Your mom? She's got Fu.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.800
[That's right.]

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.520
[Why would she need you to take care of her?]

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.040
[Exactly.]

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.880
There's a saying

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.760
in the classics,

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.760
when Mr. Fu is around, don't travel far.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.520
It's "When your parents are alive, don't travel far."

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.480
Hi, mom.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.000
I'm fine.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.200
I just wanted to check

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.080
if you're still up this late.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.760
I'm your sleep supervisor,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.160
Daoqi.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.720
Look at the time.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.160
This is the latest

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.040
time you should be awake,

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:40.720
okay?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.680
No

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.920
staying up past this anymore.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:44.960
Where's Fu?

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.040
Look,

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.920
you should learn from him.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.520
Early to bed, early to rise.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.760
It's getting cold.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.440
Put on more clothes when you go outside.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:57.840
Don't worry.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.800
Good night.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.960
[Ms. Cheng,]

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.800
[the deceased had]

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.880
[separated his personal]

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.760
[and family finances]

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.880
[from the debt weeks ago.]

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.160
[His only concern]

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.880
[was you and your child.]

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.560
Standing high gives you a better view.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.000
Those gathering from the sea,

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.400
wish you a full harvest!
