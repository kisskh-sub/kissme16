=Episode 29=
(We only seek the truth)

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.240
I hereby accuse
Xiao Huaijin of two crimes.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.359
First,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.799
Xiao Huaijin forged Shen Wenyuan's notes

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.920
to frame the Shen family,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.270
and illegally trafficked iron ore.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.479
Second,

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.759
Xiao Huaijin smuggled iron ore
out of the country

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.759
and sold it to
the enemy general Jin Pulu,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.959
so he could amass troops
and forge weapons.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.120
Pei Yu.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.959
You colluded with unruly commoners
to deceive me.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.159
My death means nothing,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.719
but the Shen family's wrongful case
has yet to be cleared.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.680
Tens of thousands
of workers of Shen Shipping

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.760
are crying out for justice,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.000
trapped in endless suffering.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.920
I cling to this last breath

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.400
only to seek justice for them.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.280
Your Majesty.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.760
In the Shen family case,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.100
the culprit not only sought
to frame the Shen family,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.920
but also to use it to conceal

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.760
his treacherous ambition and treason.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.879
If my death

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.760
caneradicate traitors

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.760
and preserve the peace of the state,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.879
then I am willing to sacrifice myself.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.480
- Governor Pei.
- Governor Pei.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.439
The Prince Duan case

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.519
deserves condemnation.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.120
I ask all of you to join me

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990
in setting the truth right
across the realm,

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.120
for the sake of the world and the people.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.680
Prince Duan colluded with the enemy.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.959
He must be condemned.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.479
My lords.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.190
Whoever helps His Majesty set
the truth right across the realm

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
will earn merit for generations to come.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.680
Merit for generations to come.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
My lords.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.599
I, Pei, pay my respects to you all.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.319
Your Majesty.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.319
When the people live in peace,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.680
the realm is at peace.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680
What is more,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.520
this matter concerns

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.000
relations between two states.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.120
In my humble view,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.159
it must be handled

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.919
with the utmost caution.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.719
Your Majesty.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.439
The Shen case has spread
widely among the people

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.599
and drawn intense attention
across the capital.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360
If there is no resolution,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.599
or if the outcome is unjust,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.400
it may

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.039
undermine the authority of the court.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.919
- We beg Your Majesty to think carefully.
- We beg Your Majesty to think carefully.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.240
(It seems)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.199
(the moment has come.)

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.599
Fine.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.400
Very well.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.919
You guys

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.360
are forcing me to do this!

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.560
Tell me!

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.520
Just how much have you all
received from the Shen family?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.360
Your Majesty.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.120
The Shen family's loyalty to the court

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.879
needs no vouching.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.990
In the eleventh year
of the late emperor's Dazhen reign,

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.000
foreign forces invaded Daliang.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.800
The Shen family sold off their assets

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.199
to raise two million dan
of military grain for the court.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.759
In the twenty-first year of Dazhen,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.719
rebels rose up in the southeast.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.439
The Shen family once again

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.719
raised twenty million taels
in military funds.

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.479
In the fifth year of the current reign,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.000
there was a drought in the northwest.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.439
In the eighth year,
floods ravaged the south.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.479
Every act of the Shen family's
loyalty to the court

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.080
is clearly

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.439
recorded by the Ministry of Revenue.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.120
You claim you obtained

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.160
evidence of Xiao Huaijin
colluding with the enemy.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.000
Jin Pulu is a treacherous official
of an enemy state.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.800
How did you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.279
manage to make contact with him?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.600
Your Majesty.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.959
I infiltrated Jin Pulu's
secret military camp

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.260
and discovered tens of thousands
of troops stationed there,

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.839
along with workshops forging weapons.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.079
The iron ore they used

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.399
came from Xiao Huaijin's trafficking.

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:48.112
As Governor of Daliang,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.720
you managed to enter

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.839
the secret camp
of a traitorous enemy general.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.000
Pei Yu.

00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:58.040
Are you not pointing fingers
to cover your own crime?

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.900
What troubles Your Majesty

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.680
is nothing more than my loyalty.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.560
To prove it, I am willing to relinquish
my post as Governor,

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.920
and surrender
command of the Qilin Guards,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.839
to accept Your Majesty's judgment.

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.319
Fine.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.000
You all think

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.160
this is enough to force my hand?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.240
Your Majesty.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.680
- All we ask
- All we ask

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.319
- is the truth.
- is the truth.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.990
- We need Your Majesty's wise judgment.
- We need Your Majesty's wise judgment.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.360
Very well.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.560
I will order

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.439
the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate thoroughly.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.088
If the allegations are proven true,
the Prince Duan's Residence

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.800
shall be dealt
with according to the law.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.160
I am weary.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.399
You may all withdraw.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.480
Your Majesty.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.240
Since Prince Duan's Residence
has been proven to be guilty,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.079
the Shen case

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.040
should also be retried
to restore faith among the people.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.783
The guilt of the Prince Duan's Residence

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.079
does not mean
the Shen family's innocence.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.160
The Shen case was settled long ago.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.480
This matter

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.079
is not to be mentioned again.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.199
Your Majesty.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.600
Dozens of lives from the Shen family

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.439
were slaughtered in a single night.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.600
Men, women, young and old,
none were spared.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.240
Those who hear of it are horrified,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.500
those who speak of it turn pale.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.439
Now that the evidence lies before us,

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.079
why does Your Majesty choose
to ignore their injustice?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.720
Why you...

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.000
(To My Father)
Your Majesty!

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.680
(To My Father)
Do you really

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.879
want Li Wan'er's tragedy
to happen all over again?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.360
Your Majesty.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.625
(To My Father)

00:08:01.337 --> 00:08:06.887
(Father, I don't know whether
I should feel happiness or irony.)

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.319
(Father.)

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.480
(To call you my father again,)

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.839
(I don't know whether
I should feel happiness)

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.079
(or irony.)

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.079
(You granted my father)

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.360
(the posthumous title Duke Zhongguo.)

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.160
(You bestowed upon me
the honor and wealth of a Princess.)

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.079
(Only now do I finally understand.)

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.320
(The fine silks I wear)

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.519
(and the brilliant
future beneath my feet)

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.200
(were paid for with my father's bones)

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.720
(and the blood
of the Li Army's soldiers.)

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.279
(I was nothing
more than a tool you used)

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.159
(to balance the court
and control the Li Army.)

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.679
(I should have
demanded justice from Heaven.)

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.990
(I should have made you
pay for my father's life.)

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.799
(But what I thought of most)

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.159
(was all these years)

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:11.960
(of unmatched happiness)

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.759
(you gave me.)

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:18.519
(If I do not avenge my father,)

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.279
(I am unworthy to be a human being.)

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.279
(Killing you)

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.279
(is beyond my courage.)

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.559
(What lies before me)

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.919
(is only one path.)

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.919
(I am guilty.)

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.679
(When the Shen family fell into ruin,)

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.730
(I betrayed sisterhood and struck them
while they were down.)

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.080
(Since then, my dreams have
never known peace.)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.440
(Father, have you ever,
in the still of the night,)

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.639
(seen those from
the past in your dreams)

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.200
(asking you for an answer?)

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.799
(Let it go, Father.)

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200
(Don't let the bond
between ruler and subject,)

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.639
(blood ties between family,)

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.639
(and the hearts of the people)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.759
(be destroyed by baseless suspicion.)

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320
Wan'er.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.000
How could you be so foolish?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.300
We have been father
and daughter for so many years.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.159
In my heart,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.519
you are never just a tool.

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:38.159
Silly child.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:40.840
Your Majesty.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.919
I have one more item to present.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:02.799
This was Wan'er's
most treasured possession.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.639
She never let it out of her sight.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:10.240
It was a gift you personally gave her

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.600
on the day the Princess came of age.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:14.519
In the Princess's heart,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.159
even with resentment,

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.879
she could never bring herself
to blame Your Majesty.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.240
Because to her, you are both
her sovereign and her father,

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.240
and the one the people
of the realm rely on.

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:30.559
Your Majesty, if you will not seek justice
for the Shen family,

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.960
then who possibly can?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.000
I am

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.600
the sovereign father
of the people of Daliang,

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:53.120
and their only pillar of support.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.840
The imperial household
knows no affection.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.720
An emperor is forever
prone to suspicion.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.120
He is willing to sacrifice anyone.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.200
Now,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.320
Pei Yu and the others have
secured irrefutable proof.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.559
I will inevitably meet the same end
as General Li.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.440
Since that is the case,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.919
rather than waiting to be slaughtered,

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:17.120
I might as well gamble everything.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.159
Your Highness is wise.

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.360
When I departed,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.559
General Jin instructed me

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:21.879
to follow Prince Duan's commands

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.960
and ensure Prince Duan's success
in the campaign.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.000
Brothers!

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.639
The palace gates have been forced open.

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:28.000
Whoever helps me

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
take the darned emperor's head

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.159
will be remembered as
a founding hero of my dynasty.

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.840
From this day on,
you'll rise to the highest ranks,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.200
be granted lands and titles,
nothing will be withheld.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.690
- Prince Duan is wise!
- Prince Duan is wise!

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.080
Bad news! Prince Duan has rebelled!

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320
Protect the Emperor!

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.360
Protect the Emperor!

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.320
Your Majesty, this is...

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.480
We're in the inner palace.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.960
How could rebels breach it?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.320
Your Majesty, this must be Xiao Huaijin.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.399
He's been plotting this.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.880
He used Your Majesty's birthday banquet
to launch his revolt.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.960
I will

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.679
immediately mobilize the Qilin Guards

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.039
to subdue the rebels.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.440
I urge Your Majesty

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.120
to leave the palace
through the secret passage.

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:12.639
Your Majesty,

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:14.200
the Shen family has

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.240
a hidden chamber

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:16.799
that is impossible to find.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.600
I'll take Your Majesty there at once.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.587
(Weitian Hall)

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.912
(Weitian Hall)

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.039
Darned emperor!

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:55.799
Come out and meet your death!

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.639
Prince Duan.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.890
They fled to the Shen residence.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:23.639
Your Majesty.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.519
This secret chamber

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.120
is concealed within the rockery.

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.320
It is

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.879
reinforced with black iron stone,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.200
impervious to attacks.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.519
Your Majesty may take refuge here.

00:14:43.437 --> 00:14:45.425
(End of Episode)

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:46.759
I promise you,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.080
the Shen family's case will be retried.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.890
And now you would still

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.720
cause your own sister's death
for his sake?
