00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.440
Please make way.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.720

(Ye Wuming)
Ye Wuming!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.520
First place!

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.080
I passed?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.040
You passed! You passed!

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.440
I passed!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.520
I passed!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.600
You passed!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.200
What about Mr. Su?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.000
Let me see.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.400
Here!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.160
(Su Chun)
Mr. Su also passed!

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.440
Great!

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440
You're amazing!

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.360
Let's go tell him!

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.880
Oh, no!

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.640
Oh, no!

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.960
Someone jumped off the building!

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.440
Su Chun?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.200
Mr. Su,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.760
what happened to you?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.880
Mr. Su,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.240
why were you so desperate?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.520
Wake up.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.880
You passed the exam.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.920
You passed!

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560
We can fulfill our ambitions!

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.880
- Wake up!
- (I, Su Chun,)

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.400
(native of Jinyang,)

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.400
(swear with my blood.)

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.320
(I accuse the Prime Minister
and examiners)

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720
(of manipulating the imperial exam)

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.880
(and defying the law.)

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.320
(During the exams,)

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.200
(they allowed cheating by relatives.)

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.560
(After the exams,)

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.040
(they discarded papers
from non-Jiangnan regions,)

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.440
(ignoring students'
decade-long efforts.)

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.120
(Those on the merit list)

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.000
(are all Prime Minister's cronies.)

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.200
- Save him.
- Ye Wuming.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.560
- Ye Wuming, don't do this.
- Save him!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.120
Ye Wuming, calm down!

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.960
The note says

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.040
he died demanding investigation
into exam fraud.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.000
Look!

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.920
Capital Prefecture on duty!

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.280
Clear the area!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.200
Su Chun, the juren scholar?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.240
I thought he already passed as jinshi.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.440
Why commit suicide?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.160
He must've been overwhelmed by success

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
and overjoyed.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.280
This is

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800
an accidental fall.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.200
Alright. Case closed.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.640
Let's go.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.400
Wait!

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.840
Su Chun was a juren scholar

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.320
with official status.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.880
He died abruptly.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Why rush this?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.480
Ten years of hardship

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.080
led to success.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.560
Are madness cases really so rare?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.200
What's strange?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.256
And the blood letter?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.480
This blood letter

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.160
shows his dying conviction.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.720
He used this extreme way

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.040
to expose court injustice.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.640
You...

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.520
You...

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.440
Would you really turn a blind eye?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.200
What blood letter?

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.360
Ye Wuming.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.120
What are you doing?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.440
Ye Wuming, calm down!

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.080
Ye Wuming.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.040
In broad daylight,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.680
how dare you destroy evidence?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.160
What evidence?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.864
- You fool!
- Ye Wuming.

00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:06.400
Ye Wuming.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.360
Ye Wuming, don't!

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.000
No evidence

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.680
means no nonsense.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.640
Move!

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:16.000
Move!

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.280
Oh, right.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.920
Keep watch on him.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.024
- Yes.
- Move!

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560
- Disperse!
- Go!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.600
What you staring at?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.760
Such busybodies!

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.237
Ridiculous!

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.480
Ridiculous!

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.120
Ye Wuming.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.720
Ye Wuming, don't do this.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.000
(Laughing heartily,
I step out the door.)

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.320
(How could we be common folk?)

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480
(Declaring with blood.)

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.240
(A death well deserved.)

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.720
(How splendid!)

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.240
(How splendid!)

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960
(Wuming, see you in the next life.)

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.680
Mr. Su.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.680
To our ambitions.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.040
What do you plan to do?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.560
To fulfill Mr. Su's dying wish,
of course.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.640
But his blood letter has...

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.200
It's fine.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.120
I have learned everything

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.080
in Mr. Su's blood letter.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.840
Some wield unchecked power
in the streets.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.520
At the palace exam,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.160
I'll present every injustice

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.720
Mr. Su suffered in the imperial exam

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.480
before His Majesty.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.680
Let's see who dares

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.440
block His Majesty's ears.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.040
This world is unfair.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.200
Blood must summon thunder!

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.880
If Mr. Su's blood proves insufficient,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.000
add mine to it.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.720
And mine as well.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.280
Zhifeng,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.520
Ye Wuming faces
the palace exam tomorrow.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200
Could there be danger?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.400
Since the third year of Jiayou,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.160
the palace exam no longer
fails scholars.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.920
Worst case, they receive Jinshi status.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.960
But tomorrow,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.800
he'll stand before His Majesty,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.720
condemning the exam's injustice.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.000
Su Chun

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.520
already died for this cause.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.120
I fear for him.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.160
Don't worry.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.200
Ye Wuming knows his limits.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040
Go rest now.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.600
(Nian,)

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.160
(no need to worry.)

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.000
(Once Ye Wuming appears at the exam,)

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.000
(all will be over.)
