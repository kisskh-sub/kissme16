00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.290
Does it hurt?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.159
I'll try this one.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.480
Do you have any of these
shaped like a pig?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.070
No.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.000
Nothing looks like you there.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.630
There's something else.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.360
Same for you.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.560
Luoluo, do you think Xiao Yao
would like this one?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.290
It looks quite similar to mine.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.390
I want to eat it.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720
You can taste whichever one you like.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.310
Luoluo, why are you always
thinking about eating?

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.480
It smells so good.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.390
Shut up.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.440
It smells wonderful.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.510
Why is your skin so delicate?

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.600
Ms. Fairy, if I use your fragrant balm,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.110
will I look like you?

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.210
Your skin is already delicate,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.680
but if you use our fragrant balm,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.740
it will become even better than ours.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.820
I want it!

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.830
Let me try it!

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.510
I want one too!

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.370
I want that one!

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.510
I want one too!

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.380
They're so beautiful.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.480
Ms. Fairy,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.560
where is this fragrant balm from?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.940
Realm of Mist and Void.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.160
Where is that?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.870
What kind of place is it?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.240
Have you heard of it?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.940
The Realm of Mist and Void
rests on the sea.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.600
It's a paradise for women,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.220
where women are respected above all.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.650
No men to oppress them.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.159
No arranged marriages.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.830
In the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.270
women never age,

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.920
always remaining as delicate as flowers.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.270
No wonder they're so beautiful.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.800
Can I go there too, Ms. Fairy?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.070
Does such a place really exist?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.510
Is it true?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.920
Of course it exists.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.720
Who is this?

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.240
A fairy!

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.000
A fairy!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.310
So beautiful!

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.390
Is she a fairy?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.950
A fairy.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.330
Is she a celestial being from heaven?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.750
So beautiful!

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.410
The 4 of us
are from the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.600
All the goods in this shop

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.270
are handmade
by our sisters from the realm.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.610
We now offer them to you as gifts,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.870
hoping to connect with kindred spirits.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.190
I want that one!

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.480
Look at these fragrant ointments.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.750
Girls all love them.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.550
How about we get one for Xiao Yao?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.000
But we don't have any money.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.330
What can we use to buy it?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.430
Didn't you say that good looks

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.040
can bewitch people's hearts?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.270
Look at this girl.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.680
She looks so adorably lovable.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.560
Come here quickly.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.760
She's talking to you.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.830
I knew you looked special.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.270
Your skin is so delicate.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.270
You're so pretty.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.340
If you use these,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.100
you'll look even more radiant.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.620
Feel free to pick anything

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.820
from this counter.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.720
-Ms. Fairy, I want one too!
-I want one too!

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.320
I don't have that much money.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.950
She's so lucky!

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.040
I'm so envious of her!

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.870
Can I have this as a gift?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:21.920
Of course.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.310
Go ahead and choose.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.160
I have something too!

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.800
Ms. Fairy, I have something too.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.830
I have a hairpin.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.480
This is a rouge box.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.559
I have a hairpin too!

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.720
Mine is better!

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.049
-The green one looks better.
-Pink. Pink.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.470
Thank you, Ms. Fairy.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.870
Young lady.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.030
I see you have a special connection

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.270
with the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.510
There are some special items
inside the shop.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.310
Would you like to come in and see?

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.630
Yes, I'd love to.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.550
Follow me.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.610
I'd like to as well.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.840
How can I get in?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.470
I want to go in too!

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.080
Ms. Fairy!

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.300
Ms. Fairy!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.750
So beautiful.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.120
Come closer and look.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.090
It's even more beautiful.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
Who is the person in this portrait?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.510
Is it someone imaginary

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.670
or someone real?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.490
The person in this painting

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.670
is the most beautiful being
in the Three Realms,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.730
the queen of all flowers in the world,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.570
called Dreamshard Immortal.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.600
We are all her disciples.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.240
She herself

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.120
is a thousandfold more beautiful
than this portrait.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.480
So,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.510
where is she?

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.720
Dreamshard Immortal lives

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.240
in the Realm of Mist and Void
on the celestial mountain beyond the sea.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.300
Only women with the sincerest hearts

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.320
can see her true face.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.440
If a girl is naturally gifted

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.480
and destined to meet Dreamshard Immortal,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.280
she may be accepted as a disciple

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.790
and enjoy eternal youth and beauty.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.440
I can see
you're exceptionally intelligent,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.040
far from an ordinary mortal.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.630
Me?

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.720
Yes.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.270
Take this portrait home,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.140
hang it by your bed,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.960
and make offerings of fresh flowers daily.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.290
With sincere devotion,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.530
Dreamshard Immortal will come
to take you to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.000
Ms. Fairy,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.480
I'd like to ask,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.240
why are you being so nice to me?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.270
Because

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.820
sooner or later, we'll be sisters
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.630
So how did they agree

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.430
to teach you how to make noodles?

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.910
Didn't you tell me

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.500
that silver is the most useful thing
in the human realm?

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.280
So how much silver did you give?

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.850
I don't remember exactly.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.960
100 taels?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.550
Or maybe 200.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.000
You...

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.840
With that much silver,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.870
you could buy the entire noodle shop,

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.670
but we only ate 2 bowls of noodles.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.270
But I wasn't buying noodles.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.230
I was buying your happiness.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.960
Xiao Yao!

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.030
Xiao Yao!

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.000
Xiao Yao!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.390
My Lord.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.200
Xiao Yao, yesterday was your birthday.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.320
Luoluo and I were looking everywhere
for gifts,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.480
but we're still late.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.410
Not late at all.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.080
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.080
Congratulations on your birthday.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.180
My Lord.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.690
We need to speak with Xiao Yao
about something. Is that okay?

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.440
Would you like to see

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.110
the gift we prepared for you?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.040
Let's go.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.670
Let's go.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.400
I'm leaving.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.910
Slow down.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.240
Quickly, show it to Xiao Yao.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.120
Take a look.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.440
Happy birthday.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.670
Take a look.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.270
Thank you.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.270
What is this?

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.530
Fragrant balm.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.910
Apply this to your face every day,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.720
and you'll stay youthful
and radiant forever.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.080
It smells wonderful.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.740
Doesn't it?

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.640
Where did you get it?

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.960
From the Garden of Mist and Void.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.910
I traded the flower from my head

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.610
with someone from the garden.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.270
This fragrant balm
comes from the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.530
Realm of Mist and Void?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.870
What kind of place is that?

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.970
It is a wonderful place.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.390
It's inhabited entirely
by immortal maidens.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.790
There are no men there,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.840
only women.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.080
All they do there every day

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.480
is make themselves more beautiful.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.120
Really?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.550
Yes.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.320
Among them,
there's one who is the most beautiful,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.980
called Dreamshard Immortal.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.960
Today, they gave me a painting—

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.000
only for me.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.440
Let me show you.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.000
Show me quickly.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.600
Let me see.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.280
It's exceptionally beautiful.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.000
Isn't it beautiful?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.010
It's so beautiful.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.870
Right?

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.720
No! Throw it away quickly!

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.480
Why?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.960
What's wrong, Xiao Yao?

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.620
[Pei] [Zhirui]

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.630
[Ying Ning]

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.250
[Pianpian]

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.080
Flower Demon,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.870
I saw through your true form at a glance.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.330
We've been waiting outside
for over a month

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.150
and still couldn't find

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.410
a way through Demons' Valley's barrier.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.510
Thankfully, you brought
Dreamshard Immortal's portrait in.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.630
So we can find our way
into Demons' Valley.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.340
What?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.520
Xiao Yao, run!

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.910
Luoluo!

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.570
The minor demon still got away?

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.790
I've tied her up

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.500
and left her in the woods.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.860
Take her

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.830
back to the cliff and wait for me.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.200
Where are you going now?

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.960
I'm going to meet the Demon King, Hong Ye.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.860
What's wrong with you?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.000
This is Dreamshard Immortal's order.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:15:59.870
Or maybe,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.450
you can come with me?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.560
Forget it.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
I'll wait for you at the cliff ahead.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.750
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.130
Which one

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.510
of you is the real one?

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.550
Quick! Catch her!

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.920
Quick! Catch her!

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.600
Quick. Help me fight her!

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.550
Why aren't you doing something?

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.710
Why aren't you doing something?

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.330
You two fight it out.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.690
Whoever wins

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.390
must be the real one.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.650
Whose side are you on?

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.470
Whose side are you really on?

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.920
I choose you. You're the real one.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.400
Quick. Help me fight her.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.780
Ying Ning.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.570
Do you truly not recognize me?

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.230
You, me, Zhirui, and Pei,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.420
by Dreamshard Immortal's command,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.160
came to Demons' Valley
to deliver a message to Hong Ye.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.490
Ask that one over there.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.310
You almost ruined everything!

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:11.910
After her!

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.510
Stop!

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.109
Xiao Ming!

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.270
Whenever you're in danger,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.400
you always look for Xiao Ming.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.310
Look carefully.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.160
I'm Xiao Mu.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.430
Pianpian.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.550
Subdue this cat demon.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.680
I'll wait for you at our previous spot.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.890
My Lord,

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.830
Xiao Yao has been taken away
by her accomplices.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.340
This woman is human,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.250
yet she knows demonic arts

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.400
and somehow entered Demons' Valley.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.920
You're from the Realm of Mist and Void?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.550
Exactly.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.110
The Monarch of All Demons has returned,

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.230
yet hasn't come
to see Dreamshard Immortal.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.280
So she sent me to pay a visit.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.960
I have no interest
in any dealings with her.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.940
Return Xiao Yao to me.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.260
Please rest assured, Demon King.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.800
We won't harm her in any way.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.120
We simply wish to invite you

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.280
to speak with Dreamshard Immortal
in person.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.070
My Lord!

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.380
Hong Ye, don't bother about me.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.570
Tell us,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.690
where is Dreamshard Immortal?

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.080
Hong Ye,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.680
100 years ago, you went to great lengths

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.740
to piece together the Kunlun Mirror,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.170
but you gave it to humans for nothing,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.110
which cost you your life.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.910
Now that you've awakened again,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.850
I fear your kind heart

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.310
will be deceived by humans once more.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.000
I want

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.630
to invite you
to the Realm of Mist and Void

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.720
for a little chat.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.160
I have

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.630
nothing to discuss with you.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.400
Pianpian.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.470
Present my gift.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.410
It's poison!

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.160
You...

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.980
I made this specially for you.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.400
It's called Heart-Devouring Poison.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.450
If you accept this gift,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.750
I'll have them release

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.110
these minor demons.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.910
My Lord, you absolutely cannot!

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.160
Hong Ye, don't.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.240
Hong Ye.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.730
Though your power is great,

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.490
you have too many weaknesses.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.500
If you want to neutralize it,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.240
come within 7 days

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.670
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.840
It's fine.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.000
Then we'll be waiting for you

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.090
in the Realm of Mist and Void, Demon King.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.510
Dreamshard Immortal,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.960
whose identity lies
between the Three Realms,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.580
is neither human, nor demon, nor immortal.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.610
She's called Spirit.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.640
She was originally a fairy
from the Heavenly Realm.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.480
Later, she became enamored
with the human realm

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.730
and descended to the realm
without permission.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.180
Then she married a human.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.200
Because she was tainted
by the impurities of the mortal world,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.260
she can never return
to the Heavenly Realm.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.830
She's been trapped in the cycle
of birth, aging, sickness, and death.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.560
To preserve her eternal youth,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.100
she replaced her heart

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.510
with a crystal heart.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.010
Since then,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.920
she has survived
by consuming the essence of mortal women

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.320
to maintain her beauty
and extend her life.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.390
The place where she resides

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.660
is called the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.940
In human legends,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.000
that place is known

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.300
as Penglang.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.960
So does she live on a celestial mountain?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.410
It's merely a celestial mountain
imagined by humans.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.750
The true celestial mountains

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.080
aren't so easily found.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.310
So she came to you for the Yuli Spring?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.620
Precisely.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.930
If she obtains the Yuli Spring,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.880
she can return to the Heavenly Realm.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.510
However, her true form can't leave
the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.350
So she can only transform into a nightmare

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.440
to gather disciples

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.400
who collect mortal women for her

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.350
and bring them
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.410
Our Demons' Valley

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.830
is surrounded by powerful enemies.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.630
I need everyone to work together

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.640
and cultivate diligently.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.240
Yes.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.310
Yes.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.520
Xiao Mu,
lead everyone in proper cultivation.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.960
Let's continue with the lesson.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.040
Everyone, turn to chapter 3
of the Baize Drawings.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.510
Every record in it

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.350
must be committed to memory.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.880
So when you encounter danger
in the future,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.440
you'll know how to respond.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.370
Xiao Yao.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
Xiao Yao.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.680
I'm sorry.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.880
I really didn't know
there was a trap in that portrait.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.960
I'm sorry.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.880
I'm sorry.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.710
We've brought trouble to His Lordship.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.920
You didn't know either.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.240
His Lordship's power is profound.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.240
He'll be fine.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.950
Yeah.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:52.880
My Lord!

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.310
Go back.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.200
It's nothing.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.520
It wasn't like this just now.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.400
The Heart-Devouring Poison isn't fatal.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.330
It only draws out the evil thoughts

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.130
that exist in a demon's nature.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.340
I have cultivated for 1,000 years.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.590
A tiny venomous insect

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.590
is no match for me.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.640
I'll go to Youning Cave now

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.940
to use my power to suppress it

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.270
and slowly force the venomous insect out.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.110
Xiao Mu.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.720
Yes.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.180
Lead everyone in their cultivation.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.340
Without my permission,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.540
no one is allowed to enter Youning Cave.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.830
Yes.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.310
Go to class now.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.000
But...

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.240
It's fine.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.440
Xiao Ming.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.970
I can't take it anymore.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.760
I've been at my limit for a while!

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.660
How is His Lordship doing?

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.920
I'm talking to you.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.380
How is His Lordship doing?

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.510
He says he's fine,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.750
but since I've been by his side
for so many years,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.480
how could I not notice?

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.300
He's just enduring it,

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.400
pretending nothing's wrong.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.810
What do you mean?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Dreamshard said,

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.240
7 days is the limit,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.150
but
with His Lordship's current cultivation,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.680
suppressing it for 10 days
would be his absolute limit.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.220
If the poison takes effect after 10 days,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.510
what will happen?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.070
It's better not to witness it.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.200
Dreamshard Immortal

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.920
lives in the Realm of Mist and Void
on a celestial mountain beyond the sea.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.980
Only women with the sincerest hearts

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.040
can see her true appearance.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.600
If a girl is naturally gifted

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.480
and destined to meet Dreamshard Immortal,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.280
she may be accepted as a disciple

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.750
and enjoy eternal youth and beauty.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.200
Hei Wu!

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.070
Get out now!

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.160
My Lord,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.110
why have you summoned me

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.070
so late at night?

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.310
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.000
You two have been blinded by power.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.270
You would even put

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.850
your own kind in danger.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.200
Today,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.370
I command you to leave Demons' Valley

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.550
and never return.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.400
I've been blinded by power?

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.720
Tell me which of my actions

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.980
wasn't for the benefit of our demon kind.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.400
Now you tell me to leave.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.760
On what grounds?

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.830
Xiao Yao.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:50.920

How are you feeling?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.080
I wanted to give you
the jade pendant again.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.070
But with this poison unresolved,

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.340
my presence near you

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:14.820

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.210
Otherwise, every demon in Demons' Valley

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.800
will never forgive you!

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.610
True feelings fade away like dreams.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:59.010
Reflections of flowers and the moon
are merely illusions.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.190
Hurry, let's go.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.790
Coming.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.060
Isn't Xiao Yao supposed
to be good at fortune-telling?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.840
Why can't she tell

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.520
she was born under an unlucky star?

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.590
You broomstick!

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.690
Xiao Yao is suffering enough.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.810
Don't go too far.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.590
Isn't her suffering well-deserved?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.480
Because of her,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.510
our Demons' Valley

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.510
has suffered disaster after disaster.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.670
Stop talking nonsense.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.190
This has nothing to do with Xiao Yao.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.920
That's right.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.190
We were the ones
who brought back that painting.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.510
Yes.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.880
Since I'm your classmate,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.480
let me give you both some advice.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.590
Stay away from her.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.920
Mind your own business.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.800
I'm warning you.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.000
Xiao Yao is our good friend.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.330
Yeah.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.070
Stop criticizing her like that!

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:22.510
Right!

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.670
Xiao Yao is my savior...

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.220
I shouldn't have bothered
advising you two.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.800
Luoluo.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.320
Keep watch here.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.990
Grunt twice, no matter who comes.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.550
Yes.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.710
Dali.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.620
Come, quickly.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.660
This is for you.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.400
What is this?

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.300
A safety charm.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.400
This isn't an ordinary charm.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.190
Luoluo and I risked our lives to steal it.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.280
You can use this charm

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.140
to see if His Lordship is safe now.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.330
How do I use it?

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.510
Just think of His Lordship in your heart

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.640
and burn this charm.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.360
If it burns completely to ash,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.760
it means His Lordship is safe.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.290
Then you can stop worrying.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.560
What if it doesn't burn completely?

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.640
Then it means...

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.480
We can't think about that now, Xiao Yao.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.140
If you want to try it, hurry up.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.960
We're done for if we're caught.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.810
May it burn completely to ashes.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.670
Your peace

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.480
is my peace.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.950
May it burn completely to ashes.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.670
Your peace

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.020
is my peace.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.510
What are you 3 doing here?

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.800
Not sleeping

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.260
or cultivating properly,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.230
just gathering together

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.500
and chattering away.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.320
We...

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.470
We want to cultivate,

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:33.480
but our minds aren't calm.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.940
We want to sleep but can't.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:36.720
Get some rest early.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.220
Don't miss tomorrow's morning class.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.870
Yes.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.230
Xiao Yao.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.580
Where are your 2 best friends?

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.320
They cultivated too late last night.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.020
They probably overslept.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.650
I'll go wake them up now.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.710
No need.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.630
Show me the results
of your extra practice.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.280
If you've made significant progress,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.080
I'll give you all a day off today.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.650
Hurry!

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.860
Are we going
to the Realm of Mist and Void now?

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.170
Xiao Yao, I'm thinking...

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.110
Even if we both reach
the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.700
with just the two of us,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.490
what help could we possibly be?

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.360
I don't know either.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.840
But if I just sit here waiting,

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.800
doing nothing,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.210
I'll suffer like that charm.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:13.960
Yeah.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.800
Dali.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.630
This time is different from before.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.890
It could be dangerous.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.550
If...

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.480
What do you mean?

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.920
You don't want to take me?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.650
I'm definitely going with you.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.920
His Lordship has been taken away

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.150
because of that painting

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.360
I brought back.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.280
Besides,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.230
when you saved Luoluo and me before,

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.230
you never worried about the danger.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.840
Xiao Yao, do you think

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.000
I'm too talkative?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.510
Do I annoy you?

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.920
I can be quiet if you want.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.910
To Pingjiang Prefecture. To find Bingzhu.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.330
Let's go.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.150
[Pingjiang Prefecture Office]

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.360
It's closed.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.290
Young ladies.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:54.650
The Pingjiang Prefecture Office is empty.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:55.670
[Pingjiang Prefecture Office]

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.630
Whatever grievance you have,

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.360
you should try another approach.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.400
-Where is everyone?
-Where is everyone?

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.930
What do you mean by "empty"?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
They've all left.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.670
Feiyu Guard and Prefect have left?

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.470
They're gone.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.920
Feiyu Guard captured the great demon

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.320
and returned to the capital
to report their success.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.380
The prefecture office
provided valuable assistance,

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.280
so Prefect has taken his family
to have an audience with the Emperor.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.070
He's surely going to be promoted again.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:12.630
You may go.
