00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:39.200
So what do you plan to do?

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.920
First,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.640
I feel

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.119
very sorry.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.439
I also feel

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.079
very regretful.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.759
I swear I really am

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.640
doing this for the first time.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
So I...

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.719
I...

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.479
I...

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.920
I don't seem to have done anything to you, right?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.239
On the contrary, it was you

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.200
who, at the hotel,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.719
was getting

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.120
all touchy-feely with me.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.719
I wonder, if the Qian family knew

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.200
about you helping them with the blind date,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:12.319
what would they think?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
I'll give you two choices.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.799
First,

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.120
pack up immediately and leave my house.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.879
I will also tell

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.000
Qian Kexin's parents everything without reservation.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.079
You...

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.239
living in such a big house,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.239
how can you be

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.280
so petty?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.200
And you'd tattle?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.120
Second,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.560
you can stop doing part-time jobs,

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.959
continue impersonating Qian Kexin,

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.319
and be my partner.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.280
I can pretend

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.879
that nothing happened today.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.959
Be your partner?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.400
You didn't look like you were acting during the day.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.599
You are just a Scumbag.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.359
I'm talking about a Contractual Couple.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.640
A fake couple for outsiders to see.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.799
You have ten seconds to consider.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.120
Ten.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.359
Nine.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.640
Eight.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.959
Pretending to be a couple...

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.920
it's just eating meals and watching movies, right?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.359
At most, holding hands.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.000
This Little Siwen looks like

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.680
his financial condition shouldn't be bad.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.199
In that case,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.280
wouldn't that bring my

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.319
plan to retire at thirty-six

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.199
one step closer?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.280
But this person,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.159
he wouldn't have bad intentions towards me, right?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.840
Judging from physiognomy,

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.759
he looks okay.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
He doesn't look like a bad guy.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.680
This deal,

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.159
no matter how I calculate,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.159
is worth it.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.360
Three.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.759
Two.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.960
One.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.039
I...

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.439
choose the second one.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.439
Everything is under my control.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.360
I don't want to have you forever.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.439
I just want to possess you briefly.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.840
You possessing me briefly

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.400
will only make me hate you forever.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.680
As long as you don't forget me,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
then hate me to your heart's content.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.000
Dad,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.039
can't you see I'm busy?

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.199
We can never be together.

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.000
Love isn't something you can buy,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.840
just because you want to.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.719
I just want you to

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.319
be my fake wife.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.360
With my current ability,

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.400
do you think I'm not competent enough?

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:11.280
Managing Four Seas.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.960
Kid,

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.199
want to manage Four Seas?

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:18.360
Fine.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.560
No problem.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.080
I still have that requirement.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.199
If you don't go on the blind date,

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.479
then I will let Four Seas

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.360
rot in my hands.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.560
Are you just so at ease

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.159
letting the industry Grandpa built

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.400
be destroyed in your hands?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.280
As a rich heir

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.599
can't you have some ambition?

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.800
I'm guarding this family business.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.479
Do you think it's easy for me?

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.080
Haven't you seen

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.680
how many companies have gone bankrupt now?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.240
Alright, alright.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.800
Fine.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.199
Okay.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.439
I just want you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.080
to be my fake wife.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.240
Right?

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.680
So if I succeed in the blind date, I can take over the company?

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.400
That's right.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.240
Deal.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.439
Then I demand to have the blind date immediately.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.840
Really?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.639
This Contractual Couple cooperation lasts for three months.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.879
Party B needs to

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.439
have regular dates with Party A,

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.000
meet Party A's parents,

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.879
and

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.000
act like a couple in public.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.160
No problem, right?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.800
Okay.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.800
Based on your requirements,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.959
we have also prepared a revised Quotation.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.319
It stipulates

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.319
date frequency, duration, and intimacy level.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.120
Fifteen dates are too few.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.319
At least thirty times.

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.639
The intimacy level grading is also somewhat vague.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.160
Give a brief overview.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.800
Alright.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.199
Then twenty times.

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.000
Each not exceeding one hour.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.160
Intimacy levels are divided into three grades:

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.759
namely,

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:39.240
S-level,

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.720
Level A,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.199
and B-level.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.480
S-level includes

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.639
close-up eye contact,

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.560
hugging,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.839
and kissing on the face.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.879
Among these, close-up eye contact

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.879
and hugging

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.079
are charged by the second.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.000
Kissing on the face

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.040
is charged per occurrence.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.040
Level A includes things like holding hands and waist-hugging.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.240
It's calculated as

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.639
thirty percent of the date duration.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.480
The remaining B-level is simple:

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.079
just some daily physical contact.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.920
Unlimited times.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.240
I want to change the number of dates to twenty-five.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.800
Duration not exceeding two hours.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.079
Also, the close-up eye contact clause

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.480
should be in B-level.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680
Putting it in S-level

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.279
is too demanding.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.519
Not allowed.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.480
According to psychological calculations,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.279
if a man and woman date over twenty times,

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.600
there's a high chance they'll fall in love.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.240
Prolonged eye contact

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.480
for over thirty seconds

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.160
could also lead to falling for each other.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.639
So it must be S-level.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.279
Falling in love

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.319
is caused by one party being unprofessional.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.439
This clause is invalid.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.759
Make it twenty-five times.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.079
Okay.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.720
Then let's look at

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.079
the other billing standards.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.759
All dating expenses are borne by Party A.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.600
This includes

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.160
clothing fees,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.759
makeup fees,

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.439
taxi fares,

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.360
and loss of wages compensation.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.639
Party B must not be in a relationship during the cooperation.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.439
Otherwise,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.680
the contract terminates.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.839
Both parties must not interfere with each other's privacy.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.839
They must ensure the other's complete independent personality.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.199
They must not harbor any intentions towards each other.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.519
After the cooperation ends,

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.920
they break up peacefully

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.759
and never interact again.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.519
Deal.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.639
Pleasure doing business.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.800
Good morning, Stella.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.399
Morning.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.439
What happened to you?

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.839
The new CEO hasn't even started

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.160
and already assigned us tasks.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Compile the shipment report for the first half of the year.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.639
I didn't sleep all night.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.199
It's like not seeing the person,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.920
but smelling their... output first. (Darn!)

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.879
Why didn't I receive any work tasks?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.759
Did you not check your email?

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.720
Email?

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.879
That long-sealed,

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.279
antique work email?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.639
Is he in artifact excavation?

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.600
So this is the legendary flat management.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.040
Any employee

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.519
can email the CEO directly.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.120
He really has quite the personality.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.519
There's an email from Galileo.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.480
Ga-li-le-o.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.120
Listen to that name.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.120
No way.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.439
He

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.079
wants all these things

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:12.879
all delivered today?

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:13.680
Yeah.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.480
My main job

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.399
is Live-streaming Operations for Four Seas Group.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.279
To put it simply,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.279
it's selecting suitable products for the live stream,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.319
proposing operational strategies,

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:29.800
and finding reliable suppliers to work with.

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:13.399
Oulu

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.480
Is that plush toy keychain ready?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.720
Just leave the takeout on the cabinet by the door.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.040
I see you.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.399
This guy is so handsome too.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.240
Morning.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.000
Morning.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.240
Director.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.040
Met the new president?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.800
Of course.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.639
The new president's face...

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.919
is so refined.

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.840
He looks absolutely...

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.360
like a peerless gentleman.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.399
I'd like to ask a very presumptuous question.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.840
What would you and his child...

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.320
be named?

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.159
Then call it...

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.960
Kepler.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.759
I specifically brought a magazine with his photo.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.440
My president...

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.960
What is this?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.840
This isn't your drool, is it?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.840
My coffee...

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.200
Just picture his face yourself.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.879
Did you see the new proposal I sent you?

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.840
I think before we figure out his style,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.559
we should still...

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:06.399
play it safe.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.200
Okay?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.559
Right now, I...

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.879
just hope his judgment is a bit better.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.440
Don't let me be...

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.440
disappointed in this third-generation rich heir.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.120
Here you go.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.360
Dad.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.960
Your blind date went well yesterday, huh?

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.399
Love at first sight.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.240
Look at me.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.720
Okay.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:34.039
Okay.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.000
That puts my mind at ease.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.519
From now on,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.480
you only need to do two things.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.639
First,

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.639
work hard.

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:43.679
Second,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.399
date seriously.

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:46.240
Okay.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.240
Then get back to work.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.879
I'll head out first.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.240
Dad.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.679
The company just released a new...

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:54.120
plush toy phone charm.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.519
I never use that stuff.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.279
Take a look.

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:07.039
By the way,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360
my son here...

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:11.480
isn't one to obediently follow orders.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.159
You need to send someone...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.799
to keep a close eye on him for me.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:15.360
Chairman.

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.799
I've already arranged personnel.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.320
You've done well.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:25.240
Remember,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.320
report to me at any time.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.519
I want to see if this kid...

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:32.120
is really dating or not.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.480
Woman.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.600
From today onward,

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.279
you are my wife.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:45.600
Even if you possess me,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.639
you won't truly have me.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.720
I don't want to have you forever.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.559
I only want to possess you briefly.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.000
Your brief possession of me...

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.600
will only make me hate you forever.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.120
As long as you don't forget me,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.399
then hate me to your heart's content.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.759
Look at me.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:11.159
We can never be together.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.879
Love isn't something you can just buy...

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.879
and buy whenever you want.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.679
Woman.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.080
You're far too confident.

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:20.000
I just want you...

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.480
to be my fake wife.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.480
When false is taken for true, true becomes false;

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.159
when non-being becomes being, being becomes non-being.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.720
Truth and falsehood are hard to distinguish.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:28.960
The false remains false.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.039
The true remains true.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.320
Woman.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:37.600
You have successfully caught my attention.
