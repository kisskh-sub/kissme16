=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.640
=Episode 15=

00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:15.419
Your Majesty. For generations, the Su family
has given their lives to the Mobei royal family.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.190
The old General
fought through blood and battle

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.880
on the northern frontier
for more than twenty years.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.861
Yet now,

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.211
his only bloodline

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:22.920
has been killed by the first prince.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.491
The thirty thousand soldiers
of the Su Army

00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:27.400
were all forged by the old General himself,
blade by blade and spear by spear.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.760
We kneel before Your Majesty

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.000
and beg leave to lay down our armor
and return to our fields.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.779
Yuwen Que!

00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:34.540
I raised you into the man you are today.

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:37.800
And yet you show such utter disregard
for ruler and father alike.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.374
Your Majesty,
please restrain your anger.

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:41.174
If I may be so bold,
I wish to offer a suggestion.

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:41.824
Speak!

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:43.661
From what I have learned,

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:45.952
the first prince has always acted
for the good of the realm.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.586
As for the stabbing of General Su,

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.735
it was incited
by the performer Shen Qingru.

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.699
No one knows what kind of wicked sorcery
Shen Qingru used on the first prince.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.100
With just a few words,

00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:56.240
she set two great pillars of the court
against each other.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.511
Such depth of scheming,

00:01:57.512 --> 00:01:58.741
such venomous methods,

00:01:58.742 --> 00:02:00.021
are truly abhorrent.

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:01.599
So this is her craft of sowing discord.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.861
That Shen Qingru

00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:04.274
deserves death by a thousand cuts.

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:06.724
We beg Your Majesty to see the truth
and grant Shen Qingru death,

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.021
to appease the spirit
of the old General in heaven.

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:10.181
Very well.

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:12.016
Issue the order.

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:13.656
Execute the rebel at once,

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:15.337
Shen Qingru.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:17.017
Your Majesty is wise.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:19.327
Long live our Emperor.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.777
By the Mandate of Heaven,

00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:24.177
the Emperor decrees.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.136
Shen Qingru sowed discord,

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:27.696
causing a meritorious official's death.

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:29.199
Her crimes warrant execution.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.536
She is to be beheaded today

00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:32.057
to restore order to the court.

00:02:32.058 --> 00:02:34.327
So decreed.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.218
Who dares touch her?

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:51.297
I order you, as the first prince,

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:53.498
release Shen Qingru at once.

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:57.096
Your Highness, I only act on orders.

00:02:57.097 --> 00:02:59.436
Please do not put me
in a difficult position.

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:01.392
Anyone who touches my woman

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:04.840
will pay with his life today.

00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:08.218
Your Highness, you must not.

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:09.974
Forcing this now will only doom her.

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:10.976
Endure it for the moment.

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:13.897
When His Majesty's anger subsides,
we will find another chance to save her.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:18.778
Take her away.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.777
Ru.

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:21.938
Do not be afraid.

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:23.577
I will protect you at all costs.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.177
Protect me?

00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:26.978
Is this your protection,

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:28.897
pushing me step by step

00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:30.818
into despair?

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:32.617
Go.

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:37.565
(Chengguang Hall)

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:51.897
His Highness sent me to rescue you.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:57.297
So his conscience finally stirred.

00:03:57.618 --> 00:03:59.057
A pity it came too late.

00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:00.017
Do you still love him?

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:01.737
I wish he were dead.

00:04:03.738 --> 00:04:05.577
But if he dies,

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.498
would that not let him off too easily?

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:13.617
There are pursuers. We must go.

00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:19.290
Stop.

00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:22.127

(Bountiful Harvest, Cangzhou)

You have not eaten properly
for three days.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:52.658
I cannot eat.

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:54.899
If this goes on,
your body will give out.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.011
Think of how many things
still await you.

00:05:57.012 --> 00:05:58.573
Perhaps this is for the best.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:00.177
One end to everything.

00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:02.257
This kind of life,

00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:04.937
I do not want to live it anymore.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:08.096
Young lady.

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:10.736
Are you punishing yourself,
or punishing me?

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.199
Back then, you saved my life.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.932
Must I now watch you
waste away like this?

00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:18.057
Get up.

00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:19.578
I will eat.

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:32.705
General Su.

00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:35.337
The Cangzhou travel pass
bears the military seal.

00:06:35.338 --> 00:06:36.311
You may pass unimpeded.

(Command)

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.897
Young lady, look,
that sugar figurine stall is still there.

00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:10.297
I remember you loved
osmanthus sugar figurines the most.

00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:20.617
I want to buy her freedom.

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.658
Ten taels.

00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:25.057
Here is twenty taels.

00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:26.296
Deal.

00:07:26.297 --> 00:07:28.090
See to her injuries as well.

00:07:28.737 --> 00:07:29.937
Young lady.

00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:32.177
If you had not saved me back then...

00:07:35.578 --> 00:07:36.778
Take it.

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:38.297
Thank you.

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:52.578
Young lady.

00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:56.257
I once believed

00:07:56.818 --> 00:07:59.578
that revenge
was the only reason I stayed alive.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.458
But now,

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:05.778
if I truly were to kill Yuwen Que,

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:07.677
the two nations would go to war.

00:08:07.898 --> 00:08:09.578
And these people...

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.245
Young lady...

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.529
Perhaps

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:18.111
it is time for me to let go.

00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:36.347
Cui Di?

00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:38.777
Do you remember me?

00:08:38.778 --> 00:08:42.481
Back then, in that alley by the East Market,
we even got into a fight.

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:44.462
So it was you.

00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:45.261
That scrawny,

00:08:45.262 --> 00:08:46.816
dark-skinned poor kid from back then.

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:47.777
Yes.

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:50.352
I finally made something of myself.

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:52.617
I owe it all to General Su.

00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:56.617
Back then, during the chaos of war,
my parents died amid the turmoil.

00:08:56.618 --> 00:08:59.456
If General Su had not led his troops
to wipe out the bandits,

00:08:59.457 --> 00:09:01.337
and save us common folk,

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:03.936
I would have been dead long ago.

00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:06.120
General Su was a rare kind
of good commander.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.160
He never sought credit
and never disturbed the people.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.990
Everything he did
was for the sake of the people.

00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:14.498
Su Changji?

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:17.898
Young lady.

00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:22.056
It really was him.

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:23.877
I could not be mistaken.

00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:27.315
What did you see?

00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:30.863
Nothing.

00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:33.715
Perhaps my eyes deceived me.

00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:35.416
You must be hungry. I will get you a bun.

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:36.697
Wait for me.

00:09:58.817 --> 00:10:00.097
Go, now.

00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:02.457
Who goes there?

00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:05.097
We are Cangzhou shadow guards.
Ordered to protect young lady.

00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:06.538
Protect me?

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:09.137
In our current state, who would still...

00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:11.240
Because of the jade pendant
at Madam's neck.

00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:12.658
The jade pendant?

00:10:16.337 --> 00:10:17.296
Mother.

00:10:17.297 --> 00:10:19.852
What is so special about this pendant?

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:23.457
This pendant was once a pair,

00:10:23.618 --> 00:10:25.236
carved from a single piece of fine jade,

00:10:25.237 --> 00:10:26.536
then split in two,

00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:28.527
to signify never being parted.

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:30.165
Mother.

00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:32.017
Mother.

00:10:32.018 --> 00:10:33.378
Remember this.

00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:36.257
No matter what happens,

00:10:36.258 --> 00:10:39.457
you must live on.

00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:40.857
No...

00:10:40.858 --> 00:10:42.538
This pendant

00:10:44.098 --> 00:10:45.656
will protect you.

00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:46.817
Mother.

00:10:49.618 --> 00:10:50.817
Mother.

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:53.761
So you knew this day would come.

00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:54.416
Young lady.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:55.497
We must leave at once.

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:56.497
No.

00:10:56.498 --> 00:10:57.777
I want to see for myself

00:10:57.778 --> 00:10:58.576
who it is

00:10:58.577 --> 00:11:00.097
so eager to send me to my mother.

00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:01.024
That is not the truth.

00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:03.137
What happened back then
likely hides another story.

00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:04.498
Another story?

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:07.217
Yuwen Que led troops
to slaughter my entire family.

00:11:07.297 --> 00:11:08.816
What is there left to explain?

00:11:08.817 --> 00:11:09.611
It was not so.

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:10.736
Your mother was called a boat courtesan,

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.840
but in truth, she was a favored consort
of the Emperor of Cangzhou.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.696
Prince Yuwen Que

00:11:13.697 --> 00:11:15.536
was not your mother's true enemy.

00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:16.915
Impossible.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.656
But I saw him with my own eyes...

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:20.257
Your mother was framed back then,

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:21.627
that is why...

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:23.378
Could it be that all these years,

00:11:23.618 --> 00:11:25.258
I have been hating the wrong person?
