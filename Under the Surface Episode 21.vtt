00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.560
I had a dream last night.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.460
I dreamed about Hong Ming.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.360
Hong Ming.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.100
Hong Ming died in an accident.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.520
In my dream,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.240
everything was so vivid.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.800
So,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.010
what exactly

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.200
happened that day?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.840
What's going on here?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.770
Director Xiang,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.560
the finance department says

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.840
you had the procurement department spend 60 million

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.280
to import several pieces of equipment,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.840
assigned Shi Xiaodi a car worth over 1 million,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.900
and gave him a bonus of over 3 million.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.610
What does this mean?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.320
What about the year-end bonus

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.450
we agreed on before?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.400
Since Xiaodi joined,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.160
our orders have been increasing.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
Providing him with a car and bonus

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.440
is completely justified.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.170
We should now

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.960
take this opportunity to expand the company.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.319
The profit distribution will be postponed.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.250
Don't forget that I'm also a partner in this company.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.960
All those days and nights of hard work,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.360
let's not even talk about my contributions.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.160
Now the company is making money, but I get nothing,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.760
and I don't even have the right to question how money is spent.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.480
Xiangyang, tell me,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.610
what am I, Hong Ming,

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.440
to this company? What exactly am I?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.039
Hong Ming,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.640
the company was built on the business I brought in from the Leng family,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.680
growing bit by bit.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.440
Of course I have the right to make these decisions.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.000
Brother,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
that money isn't for anything else.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.880
When we started this business,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.200
we borrowed money from friends and family

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.640
and promised to pay them back by the end of the year.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.170
Besides,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.920
I'm a registered shareholder in this company.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.250
I invested my own money.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.280
From now on, I don't care,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.280
I demand joint control of finances,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.759
or we split up.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.600
Hong Ming,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.100
how about this:

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.200
when you return from Chendu,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.080
we'll discuss it again.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.560
Okay?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.200
Fine.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.080
I'll take the high-speed train.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.840
I'll leave this afternoon

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.360
and be back tomorrow morning.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.720
How about tomorrow afternoon?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.450
Is that okay?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.440
Wait.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.620
Take the company's business car.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.560
I bought some liquor for Director Huang.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.760
Please take it to him for me.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.620
I'll have Xiaodi give you the car.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.090
Alright, got it.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.760
Hey, honey.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.840
Hongming, when will you be home?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.210
I made your favorite braised pork.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.320
I have some bad news.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490
I don't think I can make it back.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.520
I'm waiting for Shi Xiaodi to hand over the car.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.640
I need to drive to Chendu this afternoon to meet Mr. Huang.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.770
Xiangyang insists I deliver the wine.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.760
Sounds like

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.130
things didn't go well with Xiangyang.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.540
He's acting like he runs everything now.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.260
It won't be easy to negotiate.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.160
It's okay.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.290
We'll have an answer tomorrow.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.720
Let's end it if that's what needs to be done.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.200
Alright, I've got to go.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.130
I'm leaving now.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.540
Take care of yourself.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.920
Hong Ming had a car accident.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.090
It was ruled as an accident.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.740
But because of our previous disagreements,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.120
even Xie Yuxuan thought

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.000
I didn't want to share money with Hong Ming

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400
and deliberately arranged that accident.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.240
Why can't you explain it then?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.120
Maybe

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.640
Xie Yuxuan would believe you.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.440
Everyone says

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.890
I caused Hong Ming's death.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.400
I don't want to argue.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.880
I just want to atone.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400
Hong Ming is gone.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.400
I want to pay off Yuxuan's debts,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.130
but she won't even give me that chance.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.900
Xiangyang,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.920
these burdens shouldn't be yours.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.340
How long will you keep carrying them?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.480
You and I,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.020
aren't we the same?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.760
Xiaoxiao.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.600
I was going to tell you in person.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.610
But I don't think it's necessary anymore.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.880
Xiaoxiao.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.320
I want out.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.720
Xuanxuan.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.610
Are you sure about this?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.780
After everything we've done.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.120
Xiangyang is like a fish on the chopping block now.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.060
If you back out now,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.920
not only will all our efforts be wasted,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.480
but also

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360
you'll drag us all to hell.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.320
But I'm really exhausted.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.080
Xiaoxiao.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.360
I really can't hold on anymore.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.090
Besides, Xiangyang

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880
isn't nearly as bad as you said.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.500
You've fallen in love with him, haven't you?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.890
But does he love you?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.180
Does he lack women in his life?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.400
He's looking for Ye Zhiqiu

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.860
just to make up for what he missed in college.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.480
Stop talking.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.200
You don't know Xiangyang at all.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040
I saw with my own eyes

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.760
how he rejected Xiaolu when she threw herself at him.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.820
He loves Ye Zhiqiu.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.850
He's faithful to Ye Zhiqiu.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.440
But you're not Ye Zhiqiu!

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.660
You're the one who caused Ye Zhiqiu's death!

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.760
You just need to play Ye Zhiqiu well.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.200
For our sake.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.680
I'll completely destroy Xiangyang.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.360
I won't let you succeed.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.169
The nurse is coming.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.560
How are you today?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.520
Everything looks normal to me.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.880
Good.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.000
If there's any change on the patient's monitor,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.860
tell the duty nurse immediately.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.320
The monitor?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.160
Yes.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.320
Last night the heart rate sensor came loose.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.720
We thought something was wrong.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.050
The alarm went off at the nurse's station.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.440
Okay.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.400
I understand.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.760
You're awake, Xiangyang.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.890
Why are you all here?

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.920
It's nothing.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.280
The doctor will be here soon for rounds.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.940
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere today?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.880
No.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.680
Okay, I'll go now.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.050
Okay, thank you.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.780
Here, have some water.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.280
Are you feeling alright?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.220
When did you change your clothes?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.560
This morning when I was washing my face,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.640
I got my clothes wet,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.480
so I changed into another set.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.880
Would you like some breakfast?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.210
I'll get you something.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.080
Okay.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.130
Time for your IV.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720
The nurse is here.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.780
Xiangyang?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.800
Xiangyang is now like a fish on the chopping board.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.880
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.160
Yes, I apologize.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.920
The medication I just prepared is completely ruined.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.520
I'm sorry.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.400
Stop cleaning. You might prick yourself.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.520
What happened? What's going on?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.180
Head nurse,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.080
I was just about to start the IV when...

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.810
I'm so sorry.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.210
I spilled the medicine.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.520
This medication is contaminated.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.680
It can't be used anymore.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.720
Clean this up.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.360
Please prepare the medication again.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:25.760
Okay.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.900
Sorry, doctor.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.920
She's been working too hard these past few days.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.720
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.180
Xiangyang,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.940
I need to use the restroom.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.680
Xuanxuan.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.680
How is Xiangyang?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.010
He's doing fine.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.530
Did he get the IV?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.680
Yes, he did.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.210
However,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.420
the medicine was changed.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.120
Xuanxuan.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.420
Just focus on playing Ye Zhiqiu well.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.960
You don't need to handle anything else.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.080
Isn't that better?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.080
Let me tell you.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.640
This matter ends here.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.560
No one should interfere.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.240
Are you forgetting your principles for profit

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.360
or for attraction?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.160
Xiangyang married Ye Zhiqiu.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.080
Do you really think you are Ye Zhiqiu?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.800
Anyway,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.480
when I say it's over, it's over.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.540
Give yourself a break too.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.120
Don't be so childish.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.000
Let's talk in person.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.160
We'd better never see each other again.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.440
Xuanxuan.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.600
Xuanxuan.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:44.880
Mr. Xiang,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.320
um, there's something else

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.580
I need to report to you.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.560
I had a brief chat

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.720
with the police assisting with the case.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.160
He said the recently missing Shelly

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.760
appears to be roommates with the boss lady.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.460
More importantly,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.250
the boss lady's former agent Zhou Ruiqiu,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.480
allegedly,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.520
on the afternoon before her death,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.120
had lunch with someone

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.410
who looked just like the boss lady.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.540
I already know about this.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.360
Call Zhiqiu.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.200
Okay.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.440
If the police summon her again,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.490
tell her to call you.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.800
She should only speak when you're present.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.280
Okay.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.760
If there's nothing else,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.840
I'll go contact the boss lady now.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.930
Alright.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.740
Xiangyang,

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.400
why didn't you tell me about such a serious matter?

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.600
I only found out from your subordinate.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.320
I was afraid you'd worry,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.680
that's why Zhiqiu and I didn't dare tell you.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.940
Is the injury serious?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.560
Will there be lasting effects on the lungs?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.880
Sis,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.210
it's just simple pulmonary edema.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.440
If it were serious,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.180
I would've been in intensive care by now.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.600
It's nothing.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.210
That's true.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.370
If it were serious, would you still be joking around?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.610
Where's Zhiqiu?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.840
She went home

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.400
to get me some clean clothes.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.530
She'll be back soon.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.720
Oh, I made you something delicious.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.920
Eat it while it's hot.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.860
Xiangyang.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.600
Sister, you're here too. Zhiqiu has arrived.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.660
I made Xiangyang's favorite dishes.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.560
Come, try some together.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.000
Sure.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.960
Here's his favorite Yu-Shiang pork.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.440
And on the next layer, there's his favorite tomato and egg stir-fry.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.080
Here.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:33.800
Sister,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.690
there's something that's been on my mind.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.280
I really want to know the answer.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.480
What is it? Tell me.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.250
Leng Xiaoxiao has a scar

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.080
on her ankle.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.400
She told me,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.320
she...

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.080
told me it was Xiangyang.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.200
She said it was evidence of Xiangyang's

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.690
domestic violence and sexual assault. Is that true?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.980
I really don't believe it.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.920
Xiangyang is such a gentle

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.300
and sensitive person.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.890
Although sometimes

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.560
he can be

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.400
selfish and ruthless.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.620
But that's just

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.840
his protective coloration in the business world.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.100
I really can't believe

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.800
he would do such

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.800
appalling things to Leng Xiaoxiao.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.640
Because

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.080
that day, Xiaoxiao nearly killed Mom.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.360
What?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.600
Xiaoxiao.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.920
This is the

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.200
pickled radish Mom made back home.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.800
Xiangyang loves it so much.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.330
We brought some for you too.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.000
Look at you.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.040
What can you do?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.400
You can't even hold a bag properly.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.160
Are you okay?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360
It's fine.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.200
No need.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.960
Let me wipe that for you.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.440
No need.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.040
Look at these clothes.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.960
Go buy yourself a new outfit.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.840
No need.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.400
Xiaoxiao, I'm really sorry.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.880
I actually came to return your money today.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.360
Look at this.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.160
Return money?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.520
Yes.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.320
What money?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.820
It's like this.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.320
Didn't you lend me money

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.360
to buy a house?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.040
I borrowed a bit extra.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.720
And now,

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.840
I don't need the extra money,

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.340
so I'm returning it to you.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.720
Xiangyang gave you money to buy a house?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.240
Wasn't it from you?

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.770
Mom, what are you doing?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.600
What's going on?

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.360
The floor is dirty.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.160
What do you mean what's going on?

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.090
You've been keeping secret money?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.600
This is money I earned myself.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
I can decide how to spend it, can't I?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.060
You work at Cold Corporation.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.160
Isn't your salary on that bank card?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.040
The card is in the drawer.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.220
You took it out.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.220
Xiangyang.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.880
What's really going on here?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.600
Mom,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.040
this is all money I earned myself.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.099
It's only right that I spend it on you.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.960
Don't forget,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.200
everything you have comes from the Cold family.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.599
Xiaoxiao, what do you mean?

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.640
My mother is here for the first time today.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.960
What do I mean?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.000
You keep secret money and still act righteous?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.060
What secret money?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:14.839
It's money I earned myself.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.369
I can decide how to spend it.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.200
Why are you being so harsh with me?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.000
Don't forget,

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:19.880
without the Cold family,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880
you'd be nothing.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.680
If it weren't for me,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.599
would Cold Corporation be where it is today?

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.680
That's ridiculous.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.160
You forgot how you looked when you first came to our family,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160
so pathetically poor. Stop arguing.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.200
Xiaoxiao, don't go too far, okay?

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.600
Stop arguing.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.400
Who are you pretending to be?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.840
Stop arguing, Xiangyang.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.800
It's all my fault.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.720
I'm to blame.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.020
I shouldn't have come.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.280
I'll leave right now.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.960
Xiangyang, no. I'll go by myself.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.920
Mom.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.240
Mom.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.940
Xiangyang.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.920
Come back.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.600
If you dare walk out that door today,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.840
don't ever come back.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.020
Xiangyang.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.020
Xiangyang,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.960
have a good talk with Xiaoxiao.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.890
I'll go find Mom.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.240
Okay. Go quickly and see how Mom is doing.
