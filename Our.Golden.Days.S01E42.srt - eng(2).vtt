00:00:01.773 --> 00:00:03.143
A liver transplant?

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:04.913
He dropped out?

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:07.583
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:09.383
(Episode 42)

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.653
What is all this?

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:15.323
This...

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:18.323
Something this huge...

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:21.593
How did I not know about this?

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:27.063
(Shoe Joy)

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.003
She hid this from me.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:33.443
Why would she hide it?

00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:38.683
You know he's at Dongwoo Hospital in Busan, right?

00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:42.113
From now on, Woo Jin won't live the life you demand.

00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:45.753
I won't let you do that to him.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.023
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:56.463
We arranged to have people posted on Woo Jin's appointment day, right?

00:00:57.163 --> 00:00:59.963
Start standing guard a week before his appointment.

00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:03.873
The date could change, so keep checking on that too.

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:07.373
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.943
Once I get my hands on Woo Jin,

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:14.513
I'm coming for you, Ji Eun Oh.

00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:19.453
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:20.583
Right.

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:23.053
Use the information I just sent and dig up everything.

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:26.593
Find out if he got the transplant, whether he's alive or dead.

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.993
(Shoealls)

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:30.433
Director Ko Seong Hui?

00:01:30.993 --> 00:01:32.903
Of course, you put a tail on her. Do you even have to ask?

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.333
I want every single detail.

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:38.003
Don't miss a thing. Bring it all to me.

00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:44.043
(Shoealls)

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:46.713
Seong Jae. Listen carefully to what I say.

00:01:47.743 --> 00:01:49.813
I'm going to tell you everything Eun Oh went through.

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:54.723
She intentionally approached Eun Oh and won her over.

00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:57.893
Even when she was caught, she pressured her...

00:01:57.893 --> 00:01:59.523
until she agreed to the liver transplant.

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.433
I know all that.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:03.993
I already know.

00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:06.363
Did you know that woman went to see Eun Oh's mother...

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:09.103
and said she'd cut Eun Oh open while she was still alive?

00:02:11.373 --> 00:02:12.643
She said what?

00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:14.273
I...

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:16.643
will never let my son die.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.243
I'd cut her open while she's alive if I had to.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.253
To win Eun Oh's heart,

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.683
she said she would get a divorce and live with her.

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:26.023
A divorce?

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:29.423
When that failed, she offered her a ten-million-dollar building,

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:30.753
with a gift tax of 7.2 million dollars.

00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:32.493
She tried to bribe Eun Oh with it.

00:02:32.963 --> 00:02:36.293
She went to see Gang Oh with money. She even came to our office twice.

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:41.303
She called her a murderer for refusing the transplant.

00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:45.173
Seong Jae, I've seen her true colors.

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:48.103
A side I'm sure you and your father have never seen.

00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:50.413
Ji Hyuk, hold on.

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:53.843
"You witch. You murderer. This is your fault."

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:57.713
She'd throw his picture at her, calling him the brother she killed.

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:03.653
That woman has spent her whole life brainwashing Woo Jin to replace you,

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.023
grooming him for it.

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:07.593
With that goal in mind, she found Eun Oh...

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:11.493
and made her grow fond of her, just to get him the transplant.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:13.663
What kind of person does something like that?

00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:17.703
I get it. She's worse than I ever imagined.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:18.943
But...

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:21.003
I just really don't get it.

00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:24.143
Everyone knows what she's done.

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:25.883
How could she go after her own daughter?

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:28.853
Her own flesh and blood, no less.

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:30.653
She declared Eun Oh legally dead.

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:33.083
The same year she married your father.

00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:35.593
Legally dead?

00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:38.153
She only took Woo Jin from the orphanage.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.123
Her daughter on the family register? She had her declared dead.

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:45.433
She did that to get your father and marry into his wealthy family.

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:49.673
If a woman like that is about to lose everything,

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:51.903
do you really think she'll go down quietly?

00:03:53.073 --> 00:03:55.313
Eun Oh will spend the rest of her life looking over her shoulder,

00:03:56.473 --> 00:03:58.783
fearing Gang Oh could be hurt or killed,

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:01.783
never knowing what awful thing might come next.

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:18.333
(My son, Seong Jae)

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:22.173
You pathetic fool.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.303
Does he think stalling and agonizing will change anything?

00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:30.573
I'll have to try and convince him again.

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:33.813
(My son, Seong Jae)

00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:37.353
Honey.

00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:39.923
I startled you, didn't I?

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:44.053
Gosh, are you trying to make yourself a widower?

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.093
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:48.263
So, what's with the surprise?

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:51.093
You know I have my alumni meeting today.

00:04:51.493 --> 00:04:53.363
I saw a beautiful flower shop on the way.

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.533
And it made me think of someone even more beautiful.

00:04:58.943 --> 00:05:02.643
That's so cheesy. We're too old for that.

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:07.943
Woo Jin's on winter break, right? When does he get back?

00:05:08.513 --> 00:05:10.253
He still has a paper to submit.

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:11.783
- Why? - Oh, well...

00:05:12.023 --> 00:05:13.423
When he gets back,

00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:15.723
I was thinking of taking him and Seong Jae golfing.

00:05:16.093 --> 00:05:18.723
I heard President Min's resort opened a golf course.

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:21.423
I need to make a reservation, so let me know when he's free.

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:24.933
President Min?

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:28.503
Woo Jin will be thrilled. I'll ask him.

00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:31.373
You talk to him often, don't you?

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:34.443
"Often?" You know how sons are.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.173
I think I spoke with him this past Monday.

00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:48.083
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:50.823
You just look a little different today for some reason.

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:53.293
Maybe it's the lighting.

00:05:54.123 --> 00:05:55.193
Oh, dear.

00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:58.833
Silly me. I only meant to drop off the flowers and go.

00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:00.703
Honey, I've got to go. See you at home later.

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:04.503
- Have a good time. - I will.

00:06:07.503 --> 00:06:10.343
Startling me like that. So annoying.

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:16.453
(Younglim)

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:26.123
There's a lot to go through, so I'm using the conference room.

00:06:27.523 --> 00:06:29.263
Hey, if you're not too busy,

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:33.233
can we talk for a minute? I have a favor to ask.

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.343
You know how serious my dad is about becoming an electrician, right?

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:43.613
Believe me, I know.

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:46.643
There's an opening at HQ's Disaster Prevention Room.

00:06:48.113 --> 00:06:51.253
That's out of the question. Mr. Early would never go there.

00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:53.583
I know.

00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:56.393
Wow, you two must be close.

00:06:58.193 --> 00:06:59.263
Just hear me out.

00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:02.733
There's this CEO I got close to when I was raising funds.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.393
We'd get an employee...

00:07:04.393 --> 00:07:05.963
from the Disaster Prevention Room in his building,

00:07:06.303 --> 00:07:08.133
and my father would take his place.

00:07:08.463 --> 00:07:09.733
We've already discussed it, in principle.

00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:13.073
So you want me to pretend I'm the one who recommended him?

00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:16.943
My dad is so hardworking, and he has all the certifications,

00:07:17.443 --> 00:07:19.583
but he can't get a job because of his age.

00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:22.883
I understand where you're coming from,

00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:25.353
but that's not really your dad's style, is it?

00:07:26.923 --> 00:07:28.183
My dad...

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:30.693
He's been applying to jobs as far away as Mokpo and Changwon.

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:33.023
He's seriously considering moving to the provinces for a job.

00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:40.163
Only his age is holding him back. He's more than qualified.

00:07:40.663 --> 00:07:42.033
He practically lived in the storeroom,

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:43.503
practicing day and night.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.643
Are you trying to sell me on how great Mr. Early is?

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:50.243
Oh, really?

00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:53.143
Wait, do they know how old I am?

00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:54.943
Of course, they do.

00:07:56.253 --> 00:07:59.853
By any chance, did you ask them to find me a job?

00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:03.293
No, I didn't.

00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:06.663
Really? In that case, I'll definitely go to the interview.

00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:10.333
I'm lucky to get an interview at all.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.763
Good luck with your interview. Let me know how it goes.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.703
All right.

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.973
His health and skills are what matter,

00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:25.943
not his age.

00:08:28.313 --> 00:08:29.313
Anyway,

00:08:30.383 --> 00:08:33.083
Ji Hyuk and his dad weren't close,

00:08:33.823 --> 00:08:35.183
but he really looks out for him.

00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:37.093
It's admirable.

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:42.733
But then, around the spring of his senior year,

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:44.733
my father's abdominal aorta ruptured,

00:08:45.093 --> 00:08:46.903
and he was also diagnosed with kidney cancer.

00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:50.573
So, I had to tell my son he couldn't study abroad.

00:08:50.903 --> 00:08:53.143
And for your son, especially after his senior year,

00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:55.513
I can see why he thinks things like...

00:08:55.943 --> 00:08:58.843
his environment, background, and money are important.

00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:05.083
So that was Ji Hyuk.

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:09.493
That's the pain he was carrying from his youth.

00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:14.123
He never wants to marry. Everyone knows that.

00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:15.533
You...

00:09:16.563 --> 00:09:17.633
don't suit me.

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:18.963
The next guy you choose...

00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:21.533
should be kind, not simply someone you like.

00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:23.103
Liking someone is about feelings,

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:24.773
and feelings...

00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:29.473
- are powerless. - So in the end, what you wanted...

00:09:31.173 --> 00:09:35.983
was a comfortable life for yourself, without any love or affection.

00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:38.083
To get ahead and get rich.

00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:40.283
That's all it was.

00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:46.863
If only you'd explained it to me back then...

00:09:47.623 --> 00:09:49.963
When I decided to marry Jung Bo A,

00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:54.133
I truly thought it was a win-win marriage.

00:09:56.073 --> 00:09:58.233
She had what I lacked,

00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:01.173
and she needed me.

00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:05.843
So I truly believed I wasn't doing anything wrong.

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:08.953
Now that I know his circumstances,

00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:12.183
I finally understand where he was coming from.

00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:14.283
How strange.

00:10:19.823 --> 00:10:21.163
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:10:21.223 --> 00:10:22.233
Su Bin.

00:10:22.793 --> 00:10:25.603
There's something I need to discuss. Do you have a minute?

00:10:27.903 --> 00:10:30.733
You're surprisingly more mature than me in a lot of ways.

00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:32.743
That's why.

00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:38.673
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:43.053
What am I doing?

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:53.393
He was happy because of me. That's all that matters.

00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:55.693
What does it matter what kind of woman I am,

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:57.233
if I made him happy?

00:10:57.393 --> 00:10:58.933
Blackmail is just talk.

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:02.033
How can someone actually hurt you over words?

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:03.673
She will.

00:11:04.273 --> 00:11:05.433
She's the type of person who would.

00:11:13.313 --> 00:11:14.613
Just stop, Lee Su Bin.

00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:34.563
What? I wonder if Su Bin is sick.

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:37.503
It's only 10:30pm.

00:11:38.303 --> 00:11:39.643
She must be tired.

00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:45.073
Good night, Su Bin.

00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:22.953
Su Bin...

00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:26.073
I passed the written exam...

00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:36.453
What's wrong?

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.983
You went to get kimchi and ended up fighting with Sin Yeong?

00:14:40.053 --> 00:14:41.783
Don't talk to me. I'm so annoyed.

00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:44.853
Gosh, you haven't even changed...

00:14:48.093 --> 00:14:52.903
I can also learn the on-site skills faster than anyone.

00:14:53.763 --> 00:14:56.433
- I can solve problems... - What are you mumbling about?

00:14:56.803 --> 00:15:00.003
Gosh, why are you so cranky? You're not usually like this.

00:15:06.883 --> 00:15:09.283
Hey, Lee Su Bin! Get down here.

00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:11.683
And bring all the soju with you.

00:15:16.853 --> 00:15:18.323
I said, sit down.

00:15:20.493 --> 00:15:24.263
What's so bad you're drinking alone? Two whole bottles?

00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:27.503
Are you asking me to drink with you or telling me off?

00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:29.433
Can't you see I'm getting snacks?

00:15:32.073 --> 00:15:34.603
But you sound really angry, Mom.

00:15:34.673 --> 00:15:39.013
I'm upset and annoyed, too. I saw something awful that upset me.

00:15:39.113 --> 00:15:40.243
So drink here, in front of me.

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:42.783
Let's drink together.

00:15:54.063 --> 00:15:56.633
But Mom, you can't even handle soju.

00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:00.463
I'll manage.

00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:02.263
Go on, drink.

00:16:08.543 --> 00:16:09.543
Here.

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:32.763
Time heals all wounds.

00:16:34.633 --> 00:16:36.303
So, Lee Su Bin, you...

00:16:37.233 --> 00:16:39.203
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:44.043
When was I feeling sorry for myself?

00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:48.613
I've been finding soju bottles every other day.

00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:51.383
I told you not to make it so obvious.

00:16:51.913 --> 00:16:53.783
I broke up with him just like you wanted.

00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:56.223
And now, I'm not even allowed to be miserable?

00:16:58.053 --> 00:16:59.363
Don't let it show!

00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:04.933
Yes, Su Bin. You're worrying your mother and me.

00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:06.703
You're worried?

00:17:07.363 --> 00:17:09.063
Don't worry, Dad.

00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:13.403
You will never have to worry about me over some guy again.

00:17:14.003 --> 00:17:15.673
I'm never getting married.

00:17:16.543 --> 00:17:17.573
What did you just say?

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:22.283
I'm saying you're never getting a son-in-law.

00:17:23.753 --> 00:17:24.783
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:27.383
I'd rather you just blame me.

00:17:27.483 --> 00:17:29.953
Scream at me! Yell! Beg me to let you be with him!

00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:34.363
- Honey, what's gotten into you? - Why are you doing this to me?

00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:36.163
Hey, what has gotten into you?

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:39.263
I can't believe these kids.

00:17:39.603 --> 00:17:43.303
- This is ridiculous. I'm so upset. - Why?

00:17:44.573 --> 00:17:46.243
You don't need to know.

00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:53.813
- That one time... - Don't. I'm telling you, don't.

00:17:57.183 --> 00:18:00.423
The waiter poured you a small amount to taste.

00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:03.993
"Excuse me."

00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:06.763
"Could we please have a little more wine?"

00:18:06.823 --> 00:18:09.393
"He's a really big fan of wine, you see."

00:18:11.963 --> 00:18:13.903
Please. How was I supposed to know?

00:18:13.903 --> 00:18:15.963
I had never had wine at a place like that before.

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:20.273
I mean, the waiter poured less than a single sip!

00:18:21.173 --> 00:18:25.073
You always finished a whole bottle at our restaurant.

00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:29.583
That was our second date, wasn't it? My gosh, that day...

00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:33.653
That's when I knew I had to keep seeing you.

00:18:34.653 --> 00:18:36.993
Oh, honey. It was our third date.

00:18:37.393 --> 00:18:40.393
My gosh, really?

00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:46.063
I'm home.

00:18:46.433 --> 00:18:47.833
Oh, you're back.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:50.603
Have you eaten, Seong Jae?

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:53.043
I already ate.

00:19:00.343 --> 00:19:01.713
He's still on the fence.

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:11.423
All right. Get some rest for now.

00:19:14.763 --> 00:19:16.633
See? This is why I can't talk to you.

00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:19.703
You still don't get what I'm saying, and you're just trying to leave.

00:19:24.503 --> 00:19:26.543
I have two older brothers at home.

00:19:27.273 --> 00:19:31.013
But not a single one I can talk to about my future.

00:19:32.373 --> 00:19:34.783
When I asked her about it, she said, "You have to do it!"

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:37.253
"It's what you want to do. Why wouldn't you, you dummy?"

00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:39.083
That's what she said.

00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:41.983
Who are you talking about?

00:19:46.893 --> 00:19:47.993
What did I say?

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:51.393
Was it Mom who said that?

00:19:52.463 --> 00:19:53.963
Dad, you really have no idea what's going on.

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:56.573
That Mom is always right, and that she's a good person...

00:19:57.603 --> 00:19:58.703
How are you so sure about that?

00:20:00.473 --> 00:20:03.813
That person you got advice from... Was it Ji Eun Oh?

00:20:07.843 --> 00:20:08.883
Tell me.

00:20:09.413 --> 00:20:10.713
You can tell me. It's okay.

00:20:11.653 --> 00:20:14.823
How do you know Ji Eun Oh?

00:20:18.823 --> 00:20:20.763
You don't want me to tell Dad?

00:20:21.423 --> 00:20:22.423
Are you serious?

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:23.763
Yes.

00:20:24.293 --> 00:20:25.663
You know what Dad's like.

00:20:26.803 --> 00:20:28.303
It'll crush him.

00:20:29.773 --> 00:20:30.833
That's...

00:20:31.803 --> 00:20:34.843
That's for Dad to decide once he knows the truth.

00:20:36.573 --> 00:20:40.083
We can speculate all we want, but we won't know until he's told.

00:20:40.883 --> 00:20:44.483
The real question is if it's right for Dad to keep living with her...

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.823
while being deceived this whole time.

00:20:49.453 --> 00:20:52.293
Seong Jae. You're being so rigid.

00:20:53.563 --> 00:20:56.193
Dad's the one who let himself be deceived by Mom.

00:20:56.993 --> 00:20:58.833
He was already deceived before they even got married.

00:20:59.503 --> 00:21:02.103
So he's the one who has to take responsibility for that choice.

00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:05.833
I think living a lie is just part of that responsibility.

00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:10.643
That's quite a theory you've got there.

00:21:11.143 --> 00:21:14.413
Anyway, don't you be the one to tell him.

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:16.953
Yeong Ra.

00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:18.953
Is it...

00:21:20.283 --> 00:21:21.583
Is it because she's your mom?

00:21:22.993 --> 00:21:23.993
No.

00:21:24.653 --> 00:21:26.563
As much as I can't stand my mom,

00:21:28.463 --> 00:21:30.733
I'm saying this because I don't think Dad can handle it.

00:21:33.003 --> 00:21:36.303
So you're scared of what will happen after Dad finds out?

00:21:37.073 --> 00:21:38.403
Of course, I'm scared.

00:21:39.603 --> 00:21:40.903
If Dad finds out...

00:21:43.213 --> 00:21:45.643
I don't even want to imagine the fallout.

00:21:48.043 --> 00:21:49.083
But, Yeong Ra...

00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:51.913
You're not running away again, are you?

00:21:53.123 --> 00:21:55.953
Seong Jae. I'm going to live my own life now.

00:21:56.793 --> 00:21:59.923
So you just focus on getting through your own situation.

00:22:01.293 --> 00:22:03.893
And just stay out of my business.

00:22:07.963 --> 00:22:09.063
In just a few months,

00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:12.203
you've changed so much, my little sister.

00:22:14.143 --> 00:22:15.903
You can't tell Dad either.

00:22:17.813 --> 00:22:20.343
Falling in love with Mom was Dad's choice, too.

00:22:21.983 --> 00:22:23.813
Just let Mom and Dad live their own lives.

00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:25.653
Don't even give it a second thought.

00:22:43.233 --> 00:22:44.433
My foolish father.

00:22:49.613 --> 00:22:50.613
(Work Handover, Final)

00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:53.443
(Shoe Joy Handover, Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:22:54.343 --> 00:22:56.713
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:23:01.353 --> 00:23:04.253
Sir, the Chairman wants to see you in his office immediately.

00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:21.473
I heard you asked the Support Team to bring you everything...

00:23:22.273 --> 00:23:24.613
you need to approve for the year. What are you up to?

00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:27.043
What, are you planning to quit or something?

00:23:28.543 --> 00:23:29.543
Yes.

00:23:30.353 --> 00:23:33.083
What is wrong with you? Did I object to you dating?

00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.153
I heard her family was the one against it.

00:23:35.653 --> 00:23:37.093
So it looks like you two broke up.

00:23:37.523 --> 00:23:39.053
Then why are you taking it out on me?

00:23:40.193 --> 00:23:41.663
Because you summoned Su Bin.

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.393
Even though you gave me permission to date her,

00:23:44.963 --> 00:23:46.193
you still summoned Su Bin.

00:23:46.503 --> 00:23:48.033
Hey! That was your mother...

00:23:48.603 --> 00:23:50.203
No, I was just being cautious, you know?

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.933
I thought I should meet her first, so I called her in.

00:23:53.373 --> 00:23:55.043
I bet you pressured her to just date me and nothing more.

00:23:56.443 --> 00:24:00.713
Then you should've dated a girl from a family you could marry into!

00:24:02.183 --> 00:24:03.213
Dad.

00:24:04.313 --> 00:24:06.253
Why did you remarry Mother?

00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:10.953
She was an orphan with just a high school diploma,

00:24:11.823 --> 00:24:12.893
and she already had a son.

00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:17.163
You heard all kinds of rumors from family and the business world,

00:24:17.233 --> 00:24:19.093
yet you married her with complete conviction.

00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:23.733
And you've said you were happy, right?

00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:26.973
So why are you trying to stop me?

00:24:28.373 --> 00:24:29.743
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:24:30.673 --> 00:24:34.143
Your mother now was someone I could trust completely.

00:24:34.743 --> 00:24:38.383
Her circumstances weren't great, but she was the real deal.

00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:39.823
And she still is.

00:24:40.153 --> 00:24:43.993
Do you think Su Bin doesn't measure up to her?

00:24:45.123 --> 00:24:46.793
Su Bin graduated from a good university,

00:24:47.193 --> 00:24:48.963
and she has a career she loves.

00:24:49.963 --> 00:24:52.033
Her father worked at Gyeongseong T and C...

00:24:52.033 --> 00:24:53.563
until his retirement,

00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:56.473
and my friend, Ji Hyuk, is the CEO of AP Group.

00:24:57.973 --> 00:24:59.033
And his brother is...

00:25:00.243 --> 00:25:03.213
Lee Ji Wan, Yeong Ra's savior who is protecting her.

00:25:03.973 --> 00:25:05.073
AP Group?

00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:10.913
The only reason I could stand living with that ice-cold stepmother...

00:25:11.953 --> 00:25:13.483
was thanks to Ji Hyuk's parents.

00:25:16.693 --> 00:25:20.063
They're way out of our league, not the other way around.

00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:22.293
"Ice-cold stepmother?"

00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:26.703
Listen, you. Your mother is perfect!

00:25:26.763 --> 00:25:31.133
No. Maybe she was perfect for you. She certainly seemed that way.

00:25:32.673 --> 00:25:33.743
But to me,

00:25:35.043 --> 00:25:37.613
she was nothing more than a nanny who took my mother's place.

00:25:38.313 --> 00:25:39.313
A nanny?

00:25:40.383 --> 00:25:42.043
How can you even say that...

00:25:44.153 --> 00:25:46.183
Dad, have you ever considered that I might not be normal?

00:25:46.923 --> 00:25:50.093
Always saying "yes" to you and Mom, never seeing my friends...

00:25:50.193 --> 00:25:51.693
Don't you think I was a little too well-behaved?

00:25:52.653 --> 00:25:54.093
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

00:25:54.593 --> 00:25:56.663
Who am I supposed to live that life for?

00:26:02.903 --> 00:26:04.903
I was going to tell you once everything was sorted out,

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:07.543
so I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

00:26:09.103 --> 00:26:12.343
I will ensure a smooth handover so the company isn't affected.

00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:17.083
Fine, get out. I don't need you!

00:26:30.593 --> 00:26:31.893
That pathetic fool.

00:26:42.743 --> 00:26:45.343
Seong Jae won't say anything. There's no way he will.

00:26:48.183 --> 00:26:49.283
But if he does...

00:26:49.953 --> 00:26:52.383
But what if he tells him?

00:27:15.143 --> 00:27:17.943
(Shoealls)

00:27:17.943 --> 00:27:21.643
We were short on time, so this is just our first look.

00:27:22.013 --> 00:27:24.553
Han Woo Jin had a liver transplant last month...

00:27:24.653 --> 00:27:26.283
at Cheong Ah University Hospital.

00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:28.353
He was reportedly discharged alone, without a guardian.

00:27:28.853 --> 00:27:31.893
The liver donor was Ji Eun Oh, female, age 30.

00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:34.423
Without a guardian...

00:27:37.563 --> 00:27:39.593
So he disappeared without his mother's knowledge?

00:27:41.963 --> 00:27:46.073
Rumors say the donor, Ji Eun Oh, and Han Woo Jin were twins.

00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:47.273
Should I look for proof?

00:27:52.073 --> 00:27:55.013
Her daughter died years ago, so how could they be twins?

00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:05.553
So Woo Jin had a liver transplant, and she hid it from me?

00:28:06.593 --> 00:28:08.963
When her own son's life was on the line.

00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:12.393
She's the type who'd have held on to me, begging me to save him.

00:28:13.433 --> 00:28:14.803
And she hid it from me?

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:22.143
Waiting like this is pure agony.

00:28:28.843 --> 00:28:30.483
What's so agonizing?

00:28:33.953 --> 00:28:35.483
Perfect timing.

00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:45.733
Would you like some coffee?

00:28:46.293 --> 00:28:48.233
I'm not going to tell my father,

00:28:48.963 --> 00:28:50.103
so you don't have to keep your distance.

00:28:52.233 --> 00:28:53.273
Really?

00:28:54.343 --> 00:28:57.743
And who knows? Maybe it's better for him this way.

00:28:58.613 --> 00:28:59.743
But more importantly,

00:29:00.683 --> 00:29:02.783
how could I make you suffer more, Eun Oh?

00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:06.653
Especially when you're up against someone so vicious.

00:29:08.723 --> 00:29:09.783
Thank you.

00:29:10.693 --> 00:29:11.693
And...

00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:13.793
I'm sorry.

00:29:16.363 --> 00:29:18.033
Now that we share a huge secret,

00:29:18.693 --> 00:29:20.003
I guess we have to be besties now.

00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:24.233
Besties? Whatever.

00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:26.843
You didn't even tell me you were seeing someone.

00:29:29.773 --> 00:29:30.873
That...

00:29:31.673 --> 00:29:33.073
I couldn't tell you who it was.

00:29:34.643 --> 00:29:35.783
Once I've moved on,

00:29:36.613 --> 00:29:37.853
I'll tell you all about it then.

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:42.323
You dated her,

00:29:42.653 --> 00:29:44.923
so I bet she was someone unforgettable.

00:29:49.093 --> 00:29:50.833
Wow, you're so good at reading other people,

00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:53.093
so why do you keep ignoring how Ji Hyuk feels?

00:29:56.703 --> 00:29:58.033
I didn't realize it,

00:29:58.473 --> 00:30:00.603
and I had a huge misunderstanding about the whole thing.

00:30:01.673 --> 00:30:02.903
And what was that?

00:30:03.573 --> 00:30:06.273
Both Ji Hyuk and you...

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:08.783
were way too tight-lipped for no reason.

00:30:09.243 --> 00:30:13.623
When I was wrong and lashing out, you should've told me the truth.

00:30:17.393 --> 00:30:20.923
It's a little late now, but let me tell you one more thing.

00:30:22.563 --> 00:30:23.593
You know Eun Ju, right?

00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:27.163
The woman you liked the most...

00:30:27.163 --> 00:30:29.463
was Eun Ju whom you broke up with in junior year.

00:30:30.773 --> 00:30:31.803
Of course, I do.

00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:36.473
That was his last real relationship, wasn't it?

00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:38.973
In their junior year,

00:30:39.573 --> 00:30:42.283
Eun Ju supposedly asked Ji Hyuk to go study abroad with her.

00:30:43.243 --> 00:30:44.553
It was basically a marriage proposal.

00:30:46.853 --> 00:30:48.253
She did?

00:30:49.483 --> 00:30:51.453
But apparently, Ji Hyuk told her the truth.

00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:53.623
That he couldn't afford to study abroad.

00:30:54.993 --> 00:30:56.123
And then...

00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:58.233
Eun Ju told him she wanted to break up.

00:30:59.663 --> 00:31:03.063
She said that while she loved him, if they couldn't be equals,

00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:05.533
there was no point in being together anymore.

00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:13.613
He was a wreck after they broke up.

00:31:13.983 --> 00:31:16.313
I even saw him crying once.

00:31:17.613 --> 00:31:20.483
He decided to give up on deep love and serious relationships.

00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:23.993
He'd just stay single and enjoy his life.

00:31:25.123 --> 00:31:26.893
That's pretty much how he became so jaded.

00:31:28.593 --> 00:31:32.163
But why are you telling me this now?

00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.703
I'm sure you're going through a lot yourself.

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:37.973
Because I feel bad for Ji Hyuk.

00:31:40.103 --> 00:31:44.013
He seems much more sincere than I ever gave him credit for.

00:31:50.483 --> 00:31:52.183
You came here to tell me something serious,

00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:54.153
but you ended up telling me something totally random.

00:31:58.553 --> 00:32:01.563
Right, I came to ask you about Woo Jin.

00:32:02.723 --> 00:32:05.493
By any chance, could you let me talk to him?

00:32:11.973 --> 00:32:12.973
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:18.713
I'm leaving. I already talked to Eun Oh.

00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:21.343
Hey, wait a minute!

00:32:22.443 --> 00:32:24.713
Come on, stay for a cup of tea.

00:32:25.383 --> 00:32:26.753
I already had some with Eun Oh.

00:32:28.123 --> 00:32:30.753
Then, how about a drink later tonight?

00:32:32.353 --> 00:32:33.353
Some other time.

00:32:34.263 --> 00:32:35.763
I still have a lot to deal with.

00:32:45.503 --> 00:32:46.733
Thanks, Seong Jae.

00:32:56.643 --> 00:32:58.613
I guess there's a story behind everything.

00:32:59.213 --> 00:33:02.223
Gosh, Ji Hyuk. How many skeletons do you have?

00:33:03.153 --> 00:33:04.853
He should have just told me sooner.

00:33:05.493 --> 00:33:06.493
If he had...

00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:09.193
That's what you think.

00:33:09.623 --> 00:33:13.193
You may trust yourself, but I don't trust you.

00:33:13.363 --> 00:33:16.533
I don't want to get involved with someone I can't trust.

00:33:16.803 --> 00:33:18.603
I'd rather we were just strangers.

00:33:20.173 --> 00:33:21.473
Just have a meal with me.

00:33:22.203 --> 00:33:24.243
I don't have an appetite right now.

00:33:26.343 --> 00:33:28.413
Then I wouldn't have said such harsh things.

00:33:34.983 --> 00:33:35.983
Eun Oh.

00:33:36.883 --> 00:33:38.593
You heard from Seong Jae, right?

00:33:39.653 --> 00:33:41.993
From now on, you don't have to worry.

00:33:46.663 --> 00:33:49.163
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

00:33:52.003 --> 00:33:53.103
I'll buy you a meal.

00:33:55.973 --> 00:33:58.143
A meal? Why?

00:33:59.313 --> 00:34:03.383
Don't you remember? I promised I'd treat you to a meal.

00:34:06.383 --> 00:34:07.383
When was that?

00:34:08.023 --> 00:34:09.123
You see, I...

00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:11.753
I'm going to see the final bid through.

00:34:13.523 --> 00:34:15.963
If you pull it off, I'll buy you a meal.

00:34:17.063 --> 00:34:21.363
That promise from way back when, the one about buying me a meal?

00:34:22.303 --> 00:34:25.533
I mentioned it at the showroom before my surgery.

00:34:27.703 --> 00:34:29.773
I can't believe you still remember that.

00:34:30.543 --> 00:34:33.413
Wow, you don't want to eat with me, do you?

00:34:33.813 --> 00:34:35.483
No, it's just... I've been a little busy lately.

00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:39.753
Shoot, I actually have a lunch meeting today.

00:34:39.883 --> 00:34:43.023
Then we can just do lunch tomorrow.

00:34:45.123 --> 00:34:46.123
Tomorrow?

00:34:47.363 --> 00:34:49.593
All right, fine. Let's have lunch.

00:34:58.803 --> 00:34:59.903
He's just playing it cool.

00:35:03.243 --> 00:35:05.143
What should we eat tomorrow?

00:35:11.653 --> 00:35:13.483
Eun Oh's buying me a meal?

00:35:14.723 --> 00:35:16.823
I can't believe Ji Eun Oh is treating me.

00:35:17.693 --> 00:35:19.853
What should I get?

00:35:21.093 --> 00:35:23.193
(Gaon Foundation)

00:35:27.903 --> 00:35:29.133
(Gaon Foundation)

00:35:34.373 --> 00:35:36.373
What brings you all the way out here?

00:35:37.043 --> 00:35:38.213
You should've called first.

00:35:39.543 --> 00:35:41.543
I've known what kind of person you are...

00:35:42.143 --> 00:35:43.643
for a very long time.

00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:46.553
Sit down. Come on, Seong Jae, sit down. Let's talk this over.

00:35:47.183 --> 00:35:49.883
When I was little, I found you difficult and cold.

00:35:50.423 --> 00:35:52.023
But I only learned the whole truth after I grew up.

00:35:53.723 --> 00:35:54.793
Do you remember?

00:35:55.763 --> 00:35:58.863
When a close friend of mine had to give up studying abroad...

00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:02.863
in 12th grade, I asked you to help him with a scholarship.

00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:05.503
Wait, aren't there...

00:36:05.733 --> 00:36:09.143
- more pressing issues to discuss? - I'm the one doing the talking.

00:36:10.643 --> 00:36:12.413
And all you have to do is listen.

00:36:16.513 --> 00:36:18.553
Do you know what you said to me back then?

00:36:19.913 --> 00:36:21.823
"Our foundation is for middle and high school students."

00:36:22.883 --> 00:36:26.693
"We help disadvantaged kids go to college."

00:36:27.223 --> 00:36:28.623
"But only for universities in this country."

00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:30.833
Because that was our policy.

00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:33.833
And before you said that,

00:36:34.903 --> 00:36:38.073
you asked why I didn't ask Dad, didn't you?

00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:39.773
I couldn't answer you then.

00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:45.273
Because I was too scared to ask Dad first.

00:36:48.883 --> 00:36:49.983
Get to the point.

00:36:50.653 --> 00:36:52.183
Do I look like I'm in the mood to chitchat with you?

00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:54.583
Are you getting nervous?

00:36:55.983 --> 00:36:58.553
Because you still don't know what I'm going to say?

00:37:01.323 --> 00:37:02.323
Fine.

00:37:03.093 --> 00:37:05.063
You have a lot on your chest. So, spit it out.

00:37:07.203 --> 00:37:09.963
Back then, I was just as nervous and anxious as you are right now.

00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:12.933
I kept thinking, "What if she says no?"

00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:16.173
Ji Hyuk and I were supposed to study abroad together.

00:37:18.343 --> 00:37:19.573
Nervous, anxious...

00:37:20.743 --> 00:37:22.283
Are you trying to make me feel the same way?

00:37:24.413 --> 00:37:25.783
You also told me that since you'd already said no,

00:37:26.683 --> 00:37:29.253
I'd better not do something foolish...

00:37:29.323 --> 00:37:30.953
like going to my father to ask him again.

00:37:32.123 --> 00:37:33.123
That's when I knew.

00:37:34.193 --> 00:37:35.463
You were refusing me on purpose.

00:37:38.893 --> 00:37:41.463
You didn't want me to have anyone I could rely on.

00:37:42.563 --> 00:37:43.733
I could tell you were a terrible person.

00:37:46.573 --> 00:37:47.743
I have my reasons, but...

00:37:48.273 --> 00:37:50.473
you'd just see it as an excuse, so there's no point in explaining.

00:37:52.013 --> 00:37:53.743
So just make sure Dad never finds out.

00:37:55.513 --> 00:37:57.683
I found you out, and Woo Jin found you out.

00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.483
And it looks like Yeong Ra has caught on, too.

00:38:04.093 --> 00:38:06.023
Just make absolutely sure Dad never finds out.

00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:11.363
Don't you worry about that.

00:38:12.193 --> 00:38:13.193
We're done here.

00:38:14.933 --> 00:38:16.803
You're going to need me for your own sake, too.

00:38:18.873 --> 00:38:19.973
If I'm gone,

00:38:20.303 --> 00:38:22.173
you'll be the one cleaning up all of your father's messes.

00:38:22.873 --> 00:38:26.013
If his two divorces get out, won't that hurt your marriage odds?

00:38:26.413 --> 00:38:29.413
You're a businessman. Isn't it all about the bottom line?

00:38:29.813 --> 00:38:32.853
You do things for profit. Life is like that, too.

00:38:33.453 --> 00:38:36.483
You live for what's most beneficial for you.

00:38:36.623 --> 00:38:38.293
Would you please just shut up?

00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:40.793
But tell me, Seong Jae.

00:38:41.323 --> 00:38:43.123
What's the real reason you've decided to keep quiet?

00:38:44.293 --> 00:38:45.293
It's for your father's sake, isn't it?

00:38:47.133 --> 00:38:49.363
And why should I have to explain that to you?

00:38:50.803 --> 00:38:51.803
Then what about you?

00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:55.073
Why get Woo Jin a liver transplant behind Dad's back?

00:39:10.223 --> 00:39:11.223
All right.

00:39:12.253 --> 00:39:13.923
So you know everything now. Is that it?

00:39:21.733 --> 00:39:23.263
(Gaon Foundation)

00:39:42.983 --> 00:39:44.993
(Shoealls)

00:39:45.053 --> 00:39:46.053
Dad.

00:39:47.153 --> 00:39:48.163
Sit down.

00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:56.403
Wait, what are you doing here?

00:39:56.803 --> 00:39:58.233
And where are you coming from?

00:40:01.573 --> 00:40:04.573
I had an urgent matter to deal with at my investment firm.

00:40:04.643 --> 00:40:08.283
You can lie without even blinking? You punk! Park Seong Jae!

00:40:09.683 --> 00:40:11.813
When did you start taking your father for a fool?

00:40:19.353 --> 00:40:20.623
(Gaon Foundation)

00:40:22.823 --> 00:40:25.063
Woo Jin's liver transplant. His twin.

00:40:25.893 --> 00:40:27.603
Is that what you went to discuss? How to handle the fallout?

00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:29.403
How long have you known?

00:40:30.263 --> 00:40:33.133
Your mother has been deceiving me. Why didn't you tell me right away?

00:40:34.443 --> 00:40:35.443
Dad...

00:40:35.503 --> 00:40:38.013
Don't ask how I found out. Just answer me.

00:40:39.013 --> 00:40:40.643
Why did you deceive me, too?

00:40:43.343 --> 00:40:44.353
When did you find out?

00:40:46.813 --> 00:40:48.883
What's so important about when I found out?

00:40:50.353 --> 00:40:52.323
Can't you guess why I couldn't tell you?

00:40:53.223 --> 00:40:54.663
The way you felt about that woman...

00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:59.433
How much you cherished and loved my stepmother...

00:40:59.993 --> 00:41:03.163
I've watched that for decades. How could I not be torn?

00:41:05.773 --> 00:41:07.543
So you're saying you couldn't tell because of me?

00:41:09.203 --> 00:41:10.473
How did you find out?

00:41:11.713 --> 00:41:12.813
So what are you going to do now?

00:41:14.283 --> 00:41:15.483
Why did you go to the Gaon Foundation?

00:41:19.313 --> 00:41:20.983
To tell her I wasn't going to tell you.

00:41:21.553 --> 00:41:24.353
- Why? - I just told you the reason.

00:41:25.853 --> 00:41:28.293
Is that all? Is that the only reason?

00:41:31.163 --> 00:41:32.163
No.

00:41:39.473 --> 00:41:40.703
Then keep your mouth shut.

00:41:41.973 --> 00:41:42.973
What?

00:41:44.213 --> 00:41:47.613
I'll take care of this myself, so you just look the other way.

00:41:51.653 --> 00:41:52.653
Understood.

00:42:00.993 --> 00:42:01.993
The end!

00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:05.793
I just finished the final chapter.

00:42:06.393 --> 00:42:08.103
Hey, congratulations!

00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:11.103
Your first work is officially complete.

00:42:13.373 --> 00:42:15.773
But it feels kind of weird.

00:42:17.373 --> 00:42:18.373
How so?

00:42:19.013 --> 00:42:20.013
Are you sad it's over?

00:42:20.783 --> 00:42:21.883
I'm proud,

00:42:23.213 --> 00:42:24.213
but I'm also sad.

00:42:24.753 --> 00:42:28.083
Yes, that makes sense. I hear actors say when a show ends,

00:42:28.153 --> 00:42:29.823
they have a hard time letting go of their character.

00:42:30.483 --> 00:42:32.923
I couldn't have done it without you.

00:42:37.763 --> 00:42:40.693
Hey, we agreed I'd be the first to read the final chapter, right?

00:42:45.933 --> 00:42:48.543
I hope people will be sad to see it end.

00:42:49.843 --> 00:42:51.473
As I was drawing the final sequence,

00:42:52.213 --> 00:42:55.143
I thought to myself, "Maybe I'll add a line so it won't end."

00:42:57.113 --> 00:42:58.213
What do you think? Should I?

00:42:59.353 --> 00:43:00.353
No.

00:43:00.613 --> 00:43:04.823
Everything has to end. There's no sadness if it never ends.

00:43:05.523 --> 00:43:09.623
Once the trial is over tomorrow, your stalker ordeal will end, too.

00:43:11.633 --> 00:43:12.633
The end?

00:43:14.403 --> 00:43:15.563
My time with him...

00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:18.003
will also come to an end the day after tomorrow.

00:43:25.813 --> 00:43:28.213
Wait, you're telling me to start working?

00:43:29.183 --> 00:43:30.613
You were recommended for your experience...

00:43:30.613 --> 00:43:32.683
and your strong work ethic.

00:43:32.953 --> 00:43:33.953
Why are you so surprised?

00:43:34.253 --> 00:43:35.423
It's just that...

00:43:36.083 --> 00:43:38.853
I thought there'd be at least a few other applicants.

00:43:39.653 --> 00:43:43.323
You may be a bit old, but if you can run a half-marathon,

00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:44.833
then you must be in great shape.

00:43:44.893 --> 00:43:47.333
Yes. If I'm confident in one thing, it's my stamina.

00:43:47.803 --> 00:43:50.363
- Yes. - You must be sad.

00:43:50.873 --> 00:43:53.233
You only got an allowance once, and now you already have a job.

00:43:53.433 --> 00:43:58.413
This is unfair. I planned to relax and live off my wife's allowance.

00:43:59.213 --> 00:44:02.343
- I'm home. - Ji Hyuk, your dad got a job.

00:44:03.283 --> 00:44:04.683
Really?

00:44:05.383 --> 00:44:09.083
- It's just an electrician job. - Wow, that's great.

00:44:09.323 --> 00:44:12.193
You should have a drink with Dad. I'll make some tofu with kimchi.

00:44:12.253 --> 00:44:15.323
Come on, he's busy with work. What's this with celebratory drinks?

00:44:15.693 --> 00:44:17.393
No, it's fine. Really.

00:44:17.963 --> 00:44:21.533
I wanted to ask you something. No, I mean...

00:44:21.963 --> 00:44:23.533
I need your advice on something.

00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:34.613
All right, what is it? Go on. What do you need my advice on?

00:44:35.983 --> 00:44:39.253
What advice could you possibly need? It must be about Eun Oh, you punk.

00:44:39.453 --> 00:44:41.853
My gosh, you're as sharp as ever, Dad.

00:44:43.253 --> 00:44:45.493
Hey, Dad. Here's the thing.

00:44:45.553 --> 00:44:49.093
You brat. What were you thinking when that sweet girl confessed?

00:44:49.163 --> 00:44:50.663
Now, you're having second thoughts?

00:44:51.563 --> 00:44:53.763
Wait, you even know about that?

00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:56.603
Kid, I know almost everything. Got it?

00:44:58.003 --> 00:45:01.743
I heard you turned her down cold. Why did you do that?

00:45:02.303 --> 00:45:04.543
Back then, I was...

00:45:04.643 --> 00:45:07.783
That was when I was putting on airs, saying I'd never get married.

00:45:08.213 --> 00:45:09.443
And Eun Oh was just my junior back then.

00:45:10.443 --> 00:45:14.383
And after her father passed away, she had such a hard time,

00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:17.723
so I hoped she'd meet a rich guy who could take care of her.

00:45:18.253 --> 00:45:20.123
So why are you trying to get her back now?

00:45:20.623 --> 00:45:23.463
You're not rich, and you still aren't making a lot of money.

00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:27.703
Eun Oh's not the kind of person who cares about that stuff.

00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:29.563
So what?

00:45:30.403 --> 00:45:34.843
You want me to talk you up to her? Tell her how great my son is?

00:45:35.073 --> 00:45:37.503
Of course, you have to.

00:45:38.673 --> 00:45:41.483
She's too good for you, man. Come on.

00:45:41.813 --> 00:45:43.783
Come on, Dad. I'm your son.

00:45:44.313 --> 00:45:48.483
Seriously, just give me some advice. What does she like?

00:45:50.423 --> 00:45:53.523
Just be patient a little longer. You're doing great as it is.

00:45:55.093 --> 00:45:56.093
Am I?

00:45:56.593 --> 00:45:59.193
- You think so? Am I doing okay? - Yes.

00:46:00.033 --> 00:46:01.463
Speaking of which,

00:46:02.263 --> 00:46:05.003
Eun Oh said she'd treat me to lunch tomorrow.

00:46:17.413 --> 00:46:18.413
What?

00:46:20.183 --> 00:46:23.483
This is the gift Ji Hyuk gave me for Christmas when I was a junior.

00:46:30.493 --> 00:46:32.063
I thought I had him figured out,

00:46:33.293 --> 00:46:34.533
but I was so wrong.

00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:38.903
I'm sure I threw this away.

00:46:42.343 --> 00:46:44.773
- Does this hurt? Why's it so tense? - I don't know. It's just so sore.

00:46:45.673 --> 00:46:47.173
- Mom. - Yes?

00:46:47.573 --> 00:46:48.883
Where did this doll come from?

00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:50.443
What's that?

00:46:50.813 --> 00:46:54.113
Didn't you put this in my room?

00:46:54.483 --> 00:46:57.223
Oh, I haven't seen this in ages. Where did you find it?

00:46:58.353 --> 00:47:01.863
I know, right? I'm sure I threw it away.

00:47:03.763 --> 00:47:05.763
- I found it. - What?

00:47:23.843 --> 00:47:26.313
You threw it out, so I picked it up. Finders keepers.

00:47:26.953 --> 00:47:29.223
Hey, it was mine to begin with. Give it back.

00:47:30.923 --> 00:47:31.923
What?

00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:33.853
If you want it, you can buy it. Ten dollars.

00:47:35.723 --> 00:47:37.623
Fine, I'll give you ten dollars.

00:47:39.663 --> 00:47:41.233
Wire me the ten dollars right now.

00:47:41.833 --> 00:47:42.833
Goodness.

00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:46.173
Since you gave Mom a shoulder rub, I'll make it 20 dollars.

00:47:46.233 --> 00:47:49.473
No, I refuse. Just send ten dollars. I don't take handouts.

00:47:50.473 --> 00:47:52.013
By the way, Eun Oh.

00:47:52.873 --> 00:47:56.383
What's so special about that doll to buy back what you threw away?

00:47:57.083 --> 00:48:00.753
Oh, it just has some memories attached to it.

00:48:01.923 --> 00:48:03.483
It must have fallen out of the bag.

00:48:04.223 --> 00:48:07.723
It looks like my luck with money is about to turn around next year.

00:48:09.393 --> 00:48:11.133
You mean my dad's start date?

00:48:14.603 --> 00:48:17.233
He hasn't really had a break, even after his retirement.

00:48:18.303 --> 00:48:21.973
If it's okay with your team, let's stick to two weeks from now.

00:48:23.073 --> 00:48:26.613
So he's happy it's close to home?

00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:29.813
Oh, also...

00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:32.353
This has to be a secret from my father.

00:48:36.253 --> 00:48:39.923
Mr. Song, let's talk again tomorrow. Okay.

00:48:45.533 --> 00:48:47.833
As it happens, a position opened up in my Disaster Prevention Room.

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:50.933
But if I asked you to work there, you'd obviously say no, right?

00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:52.803
Of course, I would.

00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:56.803
So I asked a building owner I know to look into it for me.

00:48:57.003 --> 00:48:59.773
His employee is totally fine with the transfer.

00:48:59.773 --> 00:49:01.613
There are no issues at all, Dad.

00:49:01.683 --> 00:49:03.113
I'm not fine with it.

00:49:03.943 --> 00:49:05.783
Whether a position opened up or not,

00:49:06.513 --> 00:49:07.713
I got that job through connections.

00:49:08.853 --> 00:49:12.723
Dad. It's hard to get hired where you want at your age.

00:49:13.523 --> 00:49:17.363
Listen here. I worked an office job for 33 years. Okay?

00:49:17.933 --> 00:49:21.133
Nobody likes the guy who gets hired because he knows someone.

00:49:21.663 --> 00:49:24.533
Either way, I'm just taking someone else's spot.

00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:28.343
You think I have not seen that kind of unfair stuff myself?

00:49:29.073 --> 00:49:31.213
And my own son...

00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:34.173
becoming the talk of the office because of me...

00:49:34.643 --> 00:49:35.943
I don't want that.

00:49:36.643 --> 00:49:37.813
Let's just drop the whole thing.

00:49:38.453 --> 00:49:39.683
Come on, Dad.

00:49:40.783 --> 00:49:44.923
I appreciate you looking out for me. But the rest of my life...

00:49:45.523 --> 00:49:47.023
is mine to figure out. Okay?

00:49:48.063 --> 00:49:49.063
Dad...

00:49:53.593 --> 00:49:55.503
Does he still not get how the world works?

00:49:57.533 --> 00:49:59.903
My dad is just so rigid.

00:50:01.803 --> 00:50:03.643
You guys should go for pollock stew and braised cod.

00:50:03.643 --> 00:50:05.043
They were Eun Oh's dad's favorites.

00:50:07.913 --> 00:50:11.113
Wait, did he come all this way just to tell me that?

00:50:14.183 --> 00:50:16.453
If he misses this chance, the year will be over,

00:50:17.323 --> 00:50:19.393
and it'll be even harder for him to find a job in that field.

00:50:22.363 --> 00:50:23.363
Honestly.

00:50:24.393 --> 00:50:25.493
He's trying to take care of his old man.

00:50:26.133 --> 00:50:28.133
He must be really worried.

00:50:30.033 --> 00:50:31.833
But still, this isn't the way, kid.

00:50:39.913 --> 00:50:41.513
Has Seong Jae left for work?

00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:42.913
Yes.

00:50:43.313 --> 00:50:45.953
It's gotten colder, so I made braised oxtail to build strength.

00:50:46.713 --> 00:50:48.583
Yeong Ra, have some of the braised oxtail.

00:50:49.253 --> 00:50:51.183
You look so drained.

00:50:52.323 --> 00:50:53.323
Okay.

00:50:53.823 --> 00:50:54.823
Yeong Ra.

00:50:55.293 --> 00:50:57.993
The verdict is being delivered for Yang Ji Il today, right?

00:50:58.533 --> 00:50:59.893
You won't have to worry anymore.

00:51:01.163 --> 00:51:04.263
- Have the Head of Legal call me. - Okay.

00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:06.373
Can't I go and see it for myself?

00:51:06.673 --> 00:51:07.673
What?

00:51:08.043 --> 00:51:11.373
I can look him right in the face and tell him, "I'm not afraid."

00:51:11.643 --> 00:51:12.813
I think I'm finally able to do that.

00:51:13.243 --> 00:51:14.573
What for?

00:51:15.783 --> 00:51:16.983
But if the trial is today,

00:51:16.983 --> 00:51:19.413
why did Mr. Lee say he'd leave tomorrow?

00:51:19.683 --> 00:51:21.853
Because the trial could be postponed at the last minute.

00:51:24.283 --> 00:51:26.753
- So, he will... - He'll work for a security firm.

00:51:27.523 --> 00:51:28.523
And I'll work on my webtoon.

00:51:30.523 --> 00:51:32.063
Is the trial running late?

00:51:33.593 --> 00:51:35.303
Hey, you're a great writer.

00:51:36.733 --> 00:51:38.933
Come on. I was just worried I'd forget,

00:51:38.933 --> 00:51:42.043
- so I just scribbled down the plot. - Quick, send me your account info.

00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:44.043
So I can call dibs on it.

00:51:44.603 --> 00:51:46.543
Come on, what "dibs?"

00:51:46.543 --> 00:51:48.283
I'd give it to you even if someone else asked.

00:51:48.483 --> 00:51:50.283
When I sign the contract with Neiro and get paid,

00:51:50.343 --> 00:51:53.253
I'll deposit the storyteller's fee into your account.

00:51:55.253 --> 00:51:57.953
All right. I'll text you my account number.

00:51:58.253 --> 00:51:59.253
A text?

00:52:03.523 --> 00:52:04.523
I think the verdict's in.

00:52:06.863 --> 00:52:09.263
- Yes, Mom. - Yang Ji Il is in custody.

00:52:09.863 --> 00:52:12.273
- He got five years in prison. - Five years?

00:52:15.003 --> 00:52:16.003
Okay.

00:52:16.643 --> 00:52:18.713
Tell Mr. Lee that today is his last day.

00:52:19.773 --> 00:52:20.943
I'll take care of it.

00:52:23.943 --> 00:52:25.283
Hey. He got five years.

00:52:25.883 --> 00:52:29.753
Come on. Only 5 years? He should be locked up for 50.

00:52:30.023 --> 00:52:33.823
But at least I can walk around without worrying, starting tomorrow.

00:52:35.823 --> 00:52:36.823
That's true.

00:52:37.823 --> 00:52:40.533
- Congratulations. - I'm so happy.

00:52:41.963 --> 00:52:43.863
Maybe I'll try walking home by myself today.

00:52:44.503 --> 00:52:45.503
Sure.

00:52:46.703 --> 00:52:48.173
So, what are you going to do now?

00:52:48.873 --> 00:52:50.373
What? About what?

00:52:50.843 --> 00:52:52.973
You don't need a bodyguard anymore, right?

00:52:53.543 --> 00:52:55.343
You can drive yourself now, can't you?

00:52:55.983 --> 00:52:56.983
Well...

00:52:58.713 --> 00:52:59.913
I guess so.

00:53:01.283 --> 00:53:04.153
But tomorrow's your last day anyway, right?

00:53:07.423 --> 00:53:08.423
Yes.

00:53:08.993 --> 00:53:11.633
Then I guess I should move my stuff back home today.

00:53:23.503 --> 00:53:24.503
Wow.

00:53:26.673 --> 00:53:28.583
Oh, my.

00:53:32.483 --> 00:53:35.223
I've never seen you eat pollock stew before.

00:53:38.083 --> 00:53:41.023
What, do we eat every meal together or something?

00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:44.463
No, I'm just saying it's surprising.

00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:48.203
My dad's favorite winter food was pollock stew.

00:53:48.663 --> 00:53:49.663
Really?

00:53:50.103 --> 00:53:52.903
Whenever it got cold, I used to ask my mom for pollock stew, too.

00:53:55.503 --> 00:53:56.503
What a coincidence.

00:53:58.003 --> 00:53:59.213
I guess we were meant to be.

00:54:00.873 --> 00:54:02.943
So it turns out your dad and I have the same taste in food.

00:54:03.313 --> 00:54:04.583
What other things do we have in common?

00:54:06.253 --> 00:54:07.713
Lately,

00:54:08.183 --> 00:54:09.883
you've been someone I can really count on.

00:54:10.553 --> 00:54:11.553
Thank you.

00:54:14.193 --> 00:54:15.293
I'm hurt.

00:54:16.493 --> 00:54:17.493
Just lately?

00:54:18.233 --> 00:54:19.233
Ji Eun Oh.

00:54:19.893 --> 00:54:22.933
I've been on your side for over ten years.

00:54:27.573 --> 00:54:28.573
Fair enough.

00:54:31.003 --> 00:54:33.273
What's with this change of tune?

00:54:37.643 --> 00:54:39.153
Just hurry up and eat.

00:54:43.983 --> 00:54:45.223
Gosh, there you go again.

00:54:48.423 --> 00:54:49.593
What are you doing?

00:54:51.423 --> 00:54:53.763
I was afraid you were going to eat your hair, too.

00:54:56.203 --> 00:54:57.203
I see.

00:54:59.233 --> 00:55:00.233
Enjoy your meal.

00:55:13.053 --> 00:55:15.353
Man, why am I so out of breath?

00:55:16.623 --> 00:55:18.153
I was fine on the way down.

00:55:19.553 --> 00:55:21.323
Of course. You were going down.

00:55:24.963 --> 00:55:27.263
Here, sit down. Have some coffee before you go.

00:55:37.903 --> 00:55:41.043
This happens when you don't exercise and do nothing but work.

00:55:41.683 --> 00:55:42.683
You're right.

00:55:43.883 --> 00:55:45.453
I should start working out again.

00:55:56.923 --> 00:55:57.923
Eun Oh.

00:55:59.833 --> 00:56:00.963
I'm okay.

00:56:01.563 --> 00:56:02.633
I'm the one who's not.

00:56:19.013 --> 00:56:20.083
Are you physically okay?

00:56:22.223 --> 00:56:24.383
You're recovering well, right?

00:56:27.593 --> 00:56:28.593
Of course.

00:56:31.493 --> 00:56:32.493
But...

00:56:33.233 --> 00:56:35.433
I don't think you're just out of shape.

00:56:36.663 --> 00:56:38.503
I guess you're not what you used to be.

00:56:38.933 --> 00:56:41.433
You used to just bound right up here.

00:56:43.673 --> 00:56:45.943
Stop eating the triangle gimbap.

00:56:46.513 --> 00:56:47.913
My dad said the same thing.

00:56:54.353 --> 00:56:55.453
And I'm asking you, too.

00:56:56.783 --> 00:56:57.783
You...

00:56:58.253 --> 00:57:00.293
Please, just eat some real food, okay?

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.093
I've got everyone worrying about me.

00:57:08.563 --> 00:57:09.963
I worry about you the most.

00:57:11.463 --> 00:57:13.133
No one worries about you as much as I do,

00:57:13.433 --> 00:57:14.573
except for your mom.

00:57:15.673 --> 00:57:16.973
There's Gang Oh, too.

00:57:17.503 --> 00:57:20.673
Comparing me to your little brother? Not even close.

00:57:32.253 --> 00:57:35.023
Oh, right. Didn't you say you had a meeting at HQ today?

00:57:37.993 --> 00:57:39.093
I totally forgot.

00:57:39.763 --> 00:57:40.763
I'd better get going.

00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:42.033
Okay.

00:57:53.743 --> 00:57:54.943
Ji Eun Oh, stop.

00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:56.983
(Team Leader's Office)

00:57:58.243 --> 00:57:59.313
Sit down.

00:58:00.253 --> 00:58:02.253
- What? - Sit.

00:58:09.323 --> 00:58:10.393
What's this all about?

00:58:11.023 --> 00:58:13.293
Why are you wearing Ji Hyuk's scarf?

00:58:15.403 --> 00:58:18.163
Oh, this. Ji Hyuk gave it to me. He said I'd be cold.

00:58:19.573 --> 00:58:22.973
He put his scarf on you just for the short walk to lunch?

00:58:23.073 --> 00:58:24.643
And you just let him?

00:58:26.173 --> 00:58:28.013
I was sitting on the stairs, so I couldn't really do anything.

00:58:30.213 --> 00:58:33.513
The almighty Ji Eun Oh says she was powerless against him.

00:58:36.053 --> 00:58:39.193
Spill it. You two crossed the line, didn't you?

00:58:39.623 --> 00:58:43.723
- What do you mean, cross the line? - Don't play dumb. Your feelings.

00:58:44.063 --> 00:58:45.863
Have your feelings for him crossed the line?

00:58:47.293 --> 00:58:48.703
You're starting to like him again, aren't you?

00:58:49.833 --> 00:58:53.803
- What do you mean? Don't be silly. - Oh, please.

00:58:54.273 --> 00:58:57.743
What are you going to do if he's tired of waiting and quits?

00:58:58.043 --> 00:58:59.073
Would you be okay with that?

00:59:00.843 --> 00:59:02.883
What do you want me to say?

00:59:03.283 --> 00:59:04.513
Just give him a hint!

00:59:05.383 --> 00:59:06.383
"Ji Hyuk."

00:59:06.853 --> 00:59:08.853
"It's okay to tell me how you feel now."

00:59:09.883 --> 00:59:11.923
Enough for him to get the hint, you know?

00:59:13.693 --> 00:59:14.693
Well...

00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:17.823
He has to give me something to go on before I can give him a sign.

00:59:18.563 --> 00:59:19.563
What?

00:59:19.633 --> 00:59:22.333
All he did was ask for forgiveness, and that's it.

00:59:23.403 --> 00:59:25.903
He said he'd wait, and that's literally all he's doing.

00:59:27.203 --> 00:59:31.203
- He's the one who must ask me out. - Wait, what?

00:59:31.973 --> 00:59:35.113
Hey, what's this? You're getting my hopes up!

00:59:35.913 --> 00:59:37.713
Whatever, just be quiet.

00:59:38.213 --> 00:59:39.253
Why?

00:59:39.313 --> 00:59:40.753
(Younglim)

00:59:40.813 --> 00:59:41.823
My gosh!

00:59:42.423 --> 00:59:43.423
Hey.

00:59:47.223 --> 00:59:48.223
Ji Eun Oh.

00:59:48.963 --> 00:59:50.393
I've been on your side...

00:59:51.093 --> 00:59:52.193
for over ten years.

00:59:54.833 --> 00:59:55.833
Fair enough.

01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:07.843
What was that?

01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:11.483
Something's definitely different about Eun Oh.

01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:54.793
So, you don't smoke or drink. You've had some chest pain...

01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:58.993
and some ankle swelling. No family history of heart disease.

01:00:59.633 --> 01:01:02.263
Have you ever had a severe cold in the past...

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:04.763
and been told it could be something like myocarditis?

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.033
I saw a doctor a few months ago for severe body aches,

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.073
but the doctor didn't say anything in particular.

01:01:11.343 --> 01:01:12.413
Your symptoms...

01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:15.343
I think we need to run some tests on your heart.

01:01:17.113 --> 01:01:20.053
- My heart? - Yes, they seem heart-related.

01:01:21.683 --> 01:01:23.083
Please get him prepped for the tests.

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.233
(Restricted Area, Authorized Personnel Only)

01:01:43.603 --> 01:01:47.773
Okay, sir. Take a deep breath in, and exhale.

01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:49.643
Okay, hold your breath, please.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.023
(DNA Cell)

01:02:00.893 --> 01:02:02.893
(Shoealls)

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:07.263
Ji Eun Oh, who donated part of her liver to Han Woo Jin,

01:02:07.533 --> 01:02:09.933
is his twin sister, just as the rumors claimed.

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.033
Apparently, she was lost and recently found.

01:02:12.873 --> 01:02:14.533
To prove their biological relationship,

01:02:14.803 --> 01:02:17.073
she and Ko Seong Hui took a DNA test.

01:02:17.143 --> 01:02:18.873
(Probability of Maternity: 99.99999998)

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.843
I had a daughter too,

01:02:21.673 --> 01:02:23.813
but she died of pneumonia right after she turned one.

01:02:24.713 --> 01:02:26.183
I kept her memory buried in my heart,

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:28.283
so I'm only filing the death certificate now.

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:31.823
Our investigation shows...

01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:34.853
she filed it herself in October 1999.

01:02:35.523 --> 01:02:37.463
The cause of death is listed as a traffic accident.

01:02:38.993 --> 01:02:40.733
She abandoned her own living daughter...

01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:44.263
and told me she was dead?

01:02:46.073 --> 01:02:50.173
She even registered her as dead a month before we got married.

01:02:51.343 --> 01:02:53.573
Then she found that same daughter...

01:02:54.773 --> 01:02:57.313
to give Woo Jin a liver transplant?

01:02:58.913 --> 01:03:01.583
Ko Seong Hui. You...

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:06.993
You think you can fool me?

01:03:08.653 --> 01:03:09.823
You...

01:03:14.593 --> 01:03:17.133
What did you just say?

01:03:20.533 --> 01:03:21.533
I'm...

01:03:24.243 --> 01:03:25.303
going to die?

01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:28.783
Your heart could stop as soon as tonight.

01:03:30.783 --> 01:03:34.213
The only real treatment is a heart transplant.

01:04:15.423 --> 01:04:18.393
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:22.463
Why is he treating me like this? Why is he being so cold?

01:04:22.603 --> 01:04:24.133
Did I actually do something wrong?

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:26.533
I'm heading to Tokyo for a bit for work.

01:04:26.603 --> 01:04:28.903
This is why everyone wants to be successful.

01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:30.603
A three-day business trip to Tokyo.

01:04:30.843 --> 01:04:34.173
Why did it have to be me? What did I do to deserve this?

01:04:34.543 --> 01:04:36.243
You're the one who told me not to get caught.

01:04:36.313 --> 01:04:38.443
Then shouldn't you be helping?

01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:40.983
You want to forgive her, don't you? Then go ahead and forgive her.

01:04:41.053 --> 01:04:44.923
She makes you want to believe her even when you know she's lying.

01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:46.193
It's quite a performance, isn't it?

01:04:46.493 --> 01:04:47.593
How did he find out?

01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:49.663
How could he have found out?
