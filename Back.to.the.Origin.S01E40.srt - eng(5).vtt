00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.240
Let me.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.880
Please proceed to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.040
the crematorium.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.360
We need to clean up here.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.840
Thanks.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.880
You're welcome.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.000
My condolences.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.320
Haven't kicked it?

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:57.680
I did.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.840
Your mom hated

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.680
me smoking.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.400
Said it would put me

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
in an early grave.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.680
Got it checked?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.760
Yeah.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.400
Nothing big,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.000
just bronchiectasis.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.760
Won't kill me,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.640
but won't get better either.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.080
Sorry.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.480
I should have known.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.560
It's OK.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.000
It happened

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
after you left.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.159
Daoqi

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.200
went with me to the hospital.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.280
Any regrets?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.800
Yeah,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.400
at first,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.720
plenty.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.760
It got better

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.440
eventually.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.720
How long?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.720
Couple of years.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.360
How about now?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.480
It still

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.360
hits me

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.560
sometimes.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.040
I keep wondering

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480
if I did

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.000
the right thing.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.280
I know you resent me for it.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.159
I resent myself too.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.080
I live...

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.520
with regret every day.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.680
If I

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.800
had stayed...

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.960
then...

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640
Don't torture yourself.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.440
But...

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.920
Can't change the past.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.600
We gotta

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.720
keep moving forward.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.280
C'mon,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.400
let's go,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.560
dinner time.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.320
Yudong,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.040
heard you were in.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.160
Came to see how you're doing.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.640
Clearing out Daoqi's office?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.320
Got your stuff packed

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.840
for Canada?

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.960
Rest assured, Mr. Xing.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.000
I'm not going anywhere.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.919
Daoqi was my brother.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.440
This is on us both.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.160
I won't leave

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.200
until we make it right.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.840
I knew it.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.480
I never doubted you for a second.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.320
What's our next move?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.040
Our PR

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.800
came up with something.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Let me

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.960
run it by you.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.320
Daoqi's death

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.200
is a terrible loss.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.960
Taken in his prime!

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.520
While it's a

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.920
massive loss for us.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.760
But, consider this,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.320
it might actually

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.240
work in

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.200
our favor.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.240
We've already got

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.400
serious clout.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.640
We're well-stocked.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.160
No need

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.480
to panic.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.040
Lady Wan's scandal?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.240
Please. Influencers're

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.240
everywhere these days.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.840
The market moves fast.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.520
Lady Wan's

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.240
gone,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.360
but there'll be

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.440
new faces.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.960
With our resources,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.960
we can attract

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.080
the best talent out there!

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.360
Plus,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.720
what happened to him

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.840
is

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.280
his personal issue.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.200
If you

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.760
and your team

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.880
cut ties...

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.040
We could

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.160
rewrite this narrative

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.880
completely.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.120
Picture this,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.720
a man honors

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.280
his fallen friend

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.040
by

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.280
leading his team

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.000
forward,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.360
fulfilling his

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.640
unfinished dreams.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.160
It's powerful stuff.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.160
It'd do wonders

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.840
for our image

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.360
and win

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.440
public sympathy!

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.640
Sure, we're at

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.800
rock bottom now.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.320
But believe me,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.520
our future's

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.960
bright!

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.320
Dr. Fu...

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.240
actually, no,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.200
if you and I

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.240
join forces,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.240
push through

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.680
this together,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.720
we'll overcome anything!

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.720
We'll honor

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.000
his final wish,

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.720
make

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.520
"Dr. Fu"

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.440
a shining example of

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.440
Chinese excellence!

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.040
Lies will never become truth.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.160
I'm releasing

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.560
a statement

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.520
with the full story.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.960
And

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.480
consider this a farewell.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.440
Let's go home.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.560
Mr. Xing,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:10.920
we're

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.040
going live.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.640
Greetings,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.920
esteemed customers of

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.240
Dr. Fu.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.960
It is with

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.120
great sadness that

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.720
I address you today.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.600
Lately,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.800
there's been

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.720
negative coverage regarding

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.280
our founder,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.680
Mr. Li Daoqi,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.440
and Lady Wan.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.720
After

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.200
this statement,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.240
I expect

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.000
an end

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.080
to these

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.000
baseless attacks!

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.480
Mr. Li bore

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.320
tremendous pressure

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.800
building this dream,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.320
all to

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.040
nurture

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.960
this up-and-coming brand.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.040
For "Dr. Fu" to survive

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.320
and thrive...

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.720
Zhang Ran.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.120
Yeah?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.160
His nerve is

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.520
almost admirable,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.480
hosting a

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.040
press conference

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.960
while universally despised.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.600
Were you listening

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.840
to me at all?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.000
That slap

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.600
was

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.000
golden!

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.440
The teaser's

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.480
a hit!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.920
They're rewriting

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.440
the whole script.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.960
The season will

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.240
center on you now.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.640
I've even

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.360
branded you:

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.640
"The Slap Queen."

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.840
You've lost your mind.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.360
I was crystal clear,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.640
I'm terminating.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.000
I won't do the show.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.040
I'm out!

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.680
You're viral.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.840
Seize the momentum!

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.000
One last time,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920
I'm done with the show.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.720
Done with the lies.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.840
I'm ending the contract.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.000
Got it?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.160
You can't.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.000
Then I'll pay.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.680
Whatever the penalty.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.920
Dream on!

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.839
I'll expose everything

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.440
about your husband's scam.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.680
You'll both burn.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.119
Listen up,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.400
I'm not afraid of that.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.480
I'll take

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.440
But you need to see a psychologist.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.880
As your ex-colleague,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.000
I sincerely wish you an early recovery.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.760

Need a ride?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.200
Five yuan.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.000
Why are you here?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Your chariot awaits!

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.080
I know.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.160
So it's settled.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.160
If it's busy, I won't make it.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.720
I'll wait for you.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.440
Tired these days?

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.080
Yeah.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.320
Too tired to even talk.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.680
But I feel so accomplished

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.960
every day.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.520
How about you?

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.280
You switched to days at the zoo,

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.880
and do designated driving at night.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.200
Must be more tired, huh?

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.560
I'm alright.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.800
Not as tired as you.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.200
But pretty happy.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.280
Back in Canada, I just swiped the card

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.920
and never thought about the money.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.560
Now 600 yuan is

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.680
right there in my hand,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.640
so I gotta spend it smart.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.520
You've truly become more mature.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.520
Lately at our zoo,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.960
a monkey got sick.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.520
Looks really pitiful.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.080
But there's not much I can do.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.840
I think animals are just like humans.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.560
I mean,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.560
if you catch a cold or fever,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.840
medicine just eases the symptoms.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.400
Time heals it in the end.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.240
Yeah.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.640
I guess people of our generation

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.800
all rely on self-healing.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.720
Mom.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.080
Can you get out of the car by yourself?

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.600
Been waiting long?

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.040
No, no, just got here.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.880
Which way?

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:07.880
This way.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.560
I'll show you, come on.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.160
You good?

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.360
Look, paintings.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.800
Fran painted them.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.400
Who?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.320
You know,

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.600
my friend from Canada.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.880
He came back a while ago.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
That's nice.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.400
Too hot?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.640
No, no, it's fine.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.520
Try my malatang.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.960
Smells great.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.720
Yeah?

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.760
Your malatang is

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.960
the non-spicy kind?

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.760
Well...

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.760
Chili's here.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.880
Mom doesn't eat spicy food, right?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.280
Help yourself to it.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.200
Just the smell of this chili

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.080
tells me it's super spicy.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.360
Not bad.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.160
Good, right?

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.600
Delicious.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.720
The broth is so rich.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.640
Mom,

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.400
I put that lucky cat you gave me

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.480
over there.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.880
Does it work?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.200
Totally.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.640
Normally at this time,

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.680
the line is at least half an hour long.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.800
I closed the shop today

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.640
just for you two.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.280
So we've got the place to ourselves.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.000
Oh, I...

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.440
I thought business was slow.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.200
No, no.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:31.920
It's fine.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.040
It's usually packed.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.600
Dad, why are you

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.080
scanning the code?

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.200
Leave him be.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.120
Then transfer me a bigger amount.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.360
Call it my investment in you.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.320
I'm taking a stake.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.240
Okay.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.240
This is my first time eating a meal

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.440
my daughter cooked herself.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.080
I love it.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.440
You like this?

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.480
Give me another scoop of chili.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.480
All this time away,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.520
never saw you eat spicy.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.160
Now you want extra chili?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:13.960
So what?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.160
My girl made it.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.320
Nian.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.960
Like I told you,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.160
I have a business trip

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.000
for a week.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.440
During this week,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.080
you'll stay with Grandma.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.040
Be good, okay?

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.160
You can have junk food

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.640
and candy,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.760
but not too much.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.000
In a couple days,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.400
Grandma will bring you back.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.320
You need to clean

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.360
the hamster cage yourself,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.800
feed them,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.800
and water Mom's plants.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.600
Can you do that?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.800
[I Found it!]

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.320
Found what?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.280
I found that missing puzzle piece

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.640
in the flowerpot.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.640
Dad must have

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.120
hidden it there.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.040
Dad is so mischievous.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.280
Lu Xinying!

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.400
Get back here, now.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.360
Wait, what's wrong

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.400
with your cousin?

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.080
It hasn't even

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.199
started yet.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.440
It's fine, let her stay up front.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.239
Wait, wait.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:25.920
Don't you think

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.560
their boat,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560
its bow is already

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.719
ahead of ours?

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:29.639
Just fall back a bit.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.719
It's just drifting over.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.440
Li Daoqi, it's all

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.400
'cause your hand

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:32.920
got hurt

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.960
that I let you

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.719
use the pedal boat.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:35.280
Can you do it or not?

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.440
If not, jump in and swim.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.560
Your cousin's already off.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.880
Your family cheats,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.719
I'm telling you!

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:42.960
It hasn't even started.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.080
It's a cheating gene!

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.320
Go!

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.520
Li Daoqi!

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.280
Why am I the only one rowing?

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.120
Li Daoqi, start rowing!

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.880
Come on, let's go!

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.680
Bye!

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.760
We passed them!

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.600
We're ahead!

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.720
Ge Kaiyang, you're not moving!

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.360
Duck.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.200
We're too slow.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.360
Now we can't even see them anymore.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.720
We're basically lost,

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.440
you know?

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.360
I don't even know

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.320
which way to go now.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.360
Fu Yudong, didn't I tell you

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.320
not to bring the fishing rod?

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.080
This is a race!

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.600
You don't respect it at all.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.080
I was rowing just now.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:45.920
But you are not now.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920
Or how could we possibly

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.760
be in first?

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.800
Besides,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.520
why does everything have to be a race?

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.600
There's not even a finish line.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.640
Why do we keep drifting that way?

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.640
Buddy, wrong direction.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.360
That way.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.000
I know.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.680
Li Daoqi said look for the crooked tree.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680
That's the finish.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.240
But every tree along the way

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.920
is crooked.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.440
There was

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.120
a little fork earlier,

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.240
we took the wrong turn.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.960
We should've gone left.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.960
Now look at us.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.480
We're falling behind.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.160
I'm rowing up front,

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.440
and you're just fishing?

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.680
You can do it.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.000
You're the best, honey.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.880
I've got something.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.040
- What?
- Something like a branch.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.120
Why is...

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.080
Where did it go?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.000
Why is our boat going in circles?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.240
They're catching up!

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.160
Hurry, hurry!

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.280
Where are they?

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.320
Behind us.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.080
Go, go!

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:47.640
Go!

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.280
Yeah, that's right.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.680
Almost struggled my ass off.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.480
Let's go. Straight ahead.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.560
Why is it suddenly foggy?

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.440
Yeah, weird time for fog.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.240
It was fine just now.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.560
Which way do we go now?

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.560
My fault.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.680
I thought

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.440
I found a shortcut.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.080
Didn't expect to get lost.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.960
There's

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.480
no signal at all here.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.320
Maybe the satellites

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.880
don't cover us here.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:25.840
When we were

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.560
driving here,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.440
the GPS was already

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.320
giving wrong directions.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.520
Didn't you say

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.640
you'd been here before?

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.240
I've been nearby,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.360
not exactly here.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:35.920
Well...

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.360
Honey.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.840
Sorry about that.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.440
My hand's no good for

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.440
steering.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800
The whole direction thing,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.640
starting today,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.480
I'm handing it over to you.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.800
I'll just pedal in the back.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.120
Where you say, I go.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.320
Okay?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.160
Okay.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.040
So now, should we

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.200
rest here,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.640
wait for the fog to clear?

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.480
Or what?

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.480
Your call.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.560
Whatever you say,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.520
we do.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.480
My call?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.880
Then we'll go

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.240
this way!

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.720
Come on.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.800
Don't hit that.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.920
Let me reverse!

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.520
Reverse! Reverse!

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.560
Come on!

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.640
Ge Kaiyang,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.280
remember that time

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.880
we went to see the sunrise?

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.160
I said life,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.640
when you look back,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.360
is really just

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.520
about a few moments.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.400
Of course I remember.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.200
Now I think

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.360
it makes more sense than ever.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.920
How old are you,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.680
getting all philosophical?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.200
Just feeling sentimental.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.320
Look at this river,

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.080
it flows nonstop.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.800
We've passed

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800
so many forks,

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.160
seen so many scenes,

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.640
run into heavy fog,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.160
even hit rocks.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.320
But that's what makes up

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320
our journey,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.400
right?

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.360
True.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.400
Lu Xinying.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.200
I've been waiting forever.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.640
I literally finished a book.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.320
Way too slow.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.360
It's not that bad.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.320
Didn't you say

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.240
a crooked tree

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.160
was the finish line?

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.880
Where is it?

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.040
See?

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.360
Told you so.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.280
Looks like we all agree.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.600
I think Zhang Ran

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.680
made it clear.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.800
You know,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.200
whichever crooked tree

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.920
you think is

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.840
your finish line,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.200
that's it.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.760
For me,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.240
it's the one

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.440
we saw when we

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.240
first set off.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.600
I finished long ago.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.480
Why not just say the tree

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.480
outside your door

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.680
is the finish line?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.960
By the way, Zhang Ran,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.320
I've been wanting to tell you something.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.080
Yeah?

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.320
Ha!

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160
I'll get you!

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.160
Hey,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.200
I'm catching up!

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.040
Pass your own crooked tree.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.200
Li Daoqi is insane.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.800
Yeah! First place!

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.840
No way, I can't stay behind.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840
Gonna hit the tree.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.280
Pass the crooked tree!

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.320
Go! Go!

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.120
First place!

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.760
Wrong way!
