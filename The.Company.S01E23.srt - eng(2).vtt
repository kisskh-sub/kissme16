00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 23=

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.359
Gu Zhiqian's paintings

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.000
are full of liveliness and energy.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.200
He must have been someone
who roamed freely

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.519
among mountains and rivers.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.239
I don't know why he became
like this now.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.680
Then I also ask you,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.439
I am also lively and energetic.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.680
If this continues,

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.879
I'll end up just like him.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.879
If you don't want to study,

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.360
then go to sleep quickly.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.120
I need to close the window,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.599
so he won't notice.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.800
It's strange.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.680
What is it?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.840
He…

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.039
The light in his study is out.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.919
It was on just now.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.560
Didn't he say
he'd study through the night?

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.439
Brother, this painting is excellent.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.680
Truly excellent.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.919
Wait...

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:46.680
Brother?

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.439
What does this painting

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.080
still lack?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.879
Who is he talking to?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.479
Autumn has deepened,

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.800
the mountains lie desolate.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.560
It feels truly cold and lonely.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.960
This hint of human presence here

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.599
is perfect.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.439
Perfect, indeed.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.159
Did you see that?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.840
That painting is moving.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.759
"My master has gone to gather herbs,

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.520
somewhere within these mountains.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.479
The clouds are too thick
to see through."

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.240
In that case,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.039
then I'll paint the man who asks the boy
for directions under the pines.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.080
Brother, are you a hermit?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.400
To me,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.719
you are like an apothecary
hidden in the mountains.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.599
Though we are separated

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.800
by life and death,

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.080
my heart still yearns for you.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.199
"The Five Peaks stand
at the heart of heaven and earth.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.720
I hear that you remain,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.120
still upon the highest summit."

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.279
Brother, that ease of spirit

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.040
is something I, Gu Zhiqian,

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.879
will never master in this lifetime.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.160
What's going on here?

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.279
Is someone painting together with him?

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.519
Could it be…

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.079
Zhao Wanli.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.460
(Youlan Alley)

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.279
Serves you right.

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.759
I told you not to mess
with that hole on the roof.

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:57.480
You just wouldn't listen.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.519
Clumsy as ever.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.290
Do you think
you're some sky-leaping monkey?

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.360
I've got it.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.600
I've got it.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.000
Got what?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.639
Look.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.680
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.319
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.560
Gu just wrote this.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.199
Who's Gu?

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.720
I've waited over half a month for him.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.560
It nearly drove me mad.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.160
I need to head back.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.839
I need to answer this.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.639
Watch where you're going.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.639
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.439
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.399
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.360
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.990
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.920
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:28.680
I've got it.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.399
I've got it!

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.120
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.319
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.399
Gu,

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.519
are you satisfied with this?

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.800
It's finally finished.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.680
Gu,

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.120
is that you?

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.920
Indeed, it is I.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.959
Who might you be?

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.160
I am Zhao Wanli.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:28.839
To meet you today

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.839
is truly my great fortune.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.519
Zhao!

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.200
Gu.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:38.600
You went silent for over half a month.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.200
Have you been well?

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.600
I was painting in the courtyard,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.679
then fell asleep in the pavilion.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:47.120
I caught a chill because of that.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.519
Thank you for your concern, Zhao.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:52.000
As long as you're well.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:53.720
As long as you're well.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.159
An Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.279
The scenery truly is breathtaking.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:04.919
To see it today,

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.720
I could die without regret.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:11.080
Alas, time so easily casts people aside.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.360
Now it is already the sun sinking
at the edge of the abyss.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.679
It's late into autumn.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.399
Gu, I must disagree.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.720
Liu Mengde once wrote,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.399
"Since ancient times,
people mourn autumn's desolation.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:29.240
I say autumn surpasses
the spring morning."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.480
Look at today's autumn scenery.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.320
It's filled with autumn's colors.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:37.279
How is it any less
than the splendor of youth?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.519
Gu,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.039
your brushwork is superb.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.159
Look at my leg.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.919
I can no longer seek famous mountains,

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:52.279
nor visit scenic wonders.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.799
This painting

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.960
was done beside
a ruined pond in my courtyard,

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:03.519
painted after broken stones
and withered trees.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.159
I have long been trapped in here.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.519
I'm of no use anymore.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.720
Gu, that is even more mistaken.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.360
When I was young,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.000
a mountain was simply a mountain.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.840
After years of life,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.679
a mountain was no longer a mountain,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.399
as though lost in mist.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.080
And now, Gu,

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.679
to be able to paint,

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.159
from a ruined pond, such beauty,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.440
it turns out a mountain is
still a mountain,

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:34.879
only that it is no longer the same one.

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.080
You've long surpassed

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.919
that youth who once
trusted only his soaring brush.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.519
Zhao, you truly understand me.

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.159
It was not in vain

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.799
that fate allowed you and me to meet.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:06.879
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.919
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.390
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.919
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.679
Zhao.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.240
At my age now,

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.639
with nothing to my name,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.720
can my spirit still be strong?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.120
In my lifetime, I have seen countless
works of calligraphy and painting.

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:40.759
Yet among them all,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.960
only your paintings are
my greatest love.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.639
I believe that
if your heart remains strong,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.000
your name will endure through the ages,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.559
never fading away!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.480
All my life, I, Gu Zhiqian,

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.320
chased fame and glory,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.759
and squandered my youth.

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:08.360
Worse still,
I failed those who loved me.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.120
I once thought that my life

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.679
would amount to nothing at all.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.759
But I never expected

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.080
to meet a confidant like you, Zhao.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.840
As long as even
one true confidant remains,

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:30.039
then I, Gu Zhiqian,

00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:34.600
have not lived this life in vain.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.399
Zhao,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.879
thank you.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.360
Zhao Wanli!

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.320
Gu!

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:53.440
Gu!

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.879
You're finally awake.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:00.679
Why…

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.799
Why am I here?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.919
You reckless fool.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.279
I told you not to drink so much.

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:06.559
You'll drink yourself to death!

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.720
You weren't breathing.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.080
I called, but you wouldn't wake up.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.960
I thought…

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.919
I thought…

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:18.840
You nearly scared me to death.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:21.240
Alright.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.080
Don't cry now.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:24.159
Don't cry.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.240
I beg you,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.480
please don't cry.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.159
Alright?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.240
You…

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.240
Don't cry.

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.759
I'm perfectly fine, see?

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.360
Don't cry.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.240
Don't cry.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.360
You absolute fool.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:56.000
I was so worried!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.679
You fool!

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.799
I'm a fool.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.840
I'm a fool.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:06.799
I'm a fool.

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.120
I've let you down all these years.

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.600
I'm a fool

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.240
for making you wait until now.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.720
I was a fool for thinking
only of my own prospects

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:19.759
and freedom.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.519
In the end, I've let you down.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.180
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.720
Zhou'er.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.600
Zhou'er.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.480
Zhou'er.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.639
Just now, a friend of mine told me

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.720
that he spent his life chasing fame,

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.159
only to squander his youth,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.720
and let those who loved him down.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.320
Now, he regrets it.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:52.200
I don't want to repeat his mistake.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.519
I want to be with you.

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:56.840
Stop talking.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.679
I'm not ready yet.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.480
Alright.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.279
It was too sudden.

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.399
It really was.

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:06.559
From this day on,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.240
I'll treat you well.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.100
I'll do good where I can,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.879
and not ask about the future.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.639
How's that?

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.600
You're smiling.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.159
That's good.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:24.679
That's good.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.279
Come.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.159
I promise you,

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.240
I'll never drink again.

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.279
All that wine was a family heirloom.

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:35.919
My father saved it back then,
thinking I'd marry one day.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:37.159
You drank it all dry.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.159
There's not even a drop left.

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:39.600
Yes.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.840
Not a single jug left.

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:45.600
Not even a drop?

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.679
You just promised
you wouldn't drink again.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:48.919
You fool.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:49.879
You're a cursed fool!

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:50.480
My dear,

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:51.799
I was just joking.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:52.720
Just kidding.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:54.879
I won't drink again. Never.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.720
I've drunk the wine
meant for your marriage,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.720
then you belong to me.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.399
Isn't that simply fate at work?

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:12.799
Who says we're a match made by heaven?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.000
My dear.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.799
My dear!

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:24.919
Coming.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.759
Scholar Zhao is here.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.519
I came.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.279
An Autumn Gift to a Friend.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.919
This is Gu's original work.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.399
Gu painted me.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.480
Not just you.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.679
He also said

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.279
you were the only
true confidant of his life.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:06.880
You two...

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.480
How did you know?

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.599
Well, you never told us

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.079
how you became his confidant.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.559
May I

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:21.680
keep this painting?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.720
Of course.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:23.759
Thank you.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.799
Thank you.

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:25.920
To be honest,

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:29.440
we've already uncovered the secret
of the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.079
We understand
the bond between you and Gu.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.400
But the Liangzhu silk used
for the Autumn Twilight Painting

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.160
once belonged to a friend of ours.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.720
That bond,

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.480
we hope you'll honor as well.

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:48.000
To me,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.960
the painting is already complete.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.079
And this painting

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:56.599
is Gu's token of friendship to me.

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:00.400
Alright.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.720
I'll exchange
the Autumn Twilight Painting with you.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.519
Please accept it.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.440
Thank you.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.799
As a gesture of thanks,

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:28.039
we also gave Madam Ran a sum of money.

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:30.440
You can renovate 3,000 Drunken Tavern

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.559
inside and out.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.039
From now on,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.720
plan your livelihood.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.720
In that case,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.119
many thanks to you both.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:55.119
Take care.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.039
Take care.

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:42.920
He's just asleep.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.119
Zhao Wanli wasn't
talking nonsense after all.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.000
He was telling the truth.

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:56.799
I never imagined this Liangzhu silk

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.319
could be so extraordinary.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.920
For a solitary scholar,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.960
being able to paint together
with Zhao Wanli

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.839
within this artwork,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.390
their hearts perfectly in sync,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.480
must have been the happiest time
of Gu Zhiqian's life.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.039
I get what you mean,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.759
but right now,

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:18.400
this is also the best moment for us

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.090
to take back
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.559
If we take it back now,

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.559
Zhao Wanli will never truly possess it,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.640
and the world will never have this
peerless work painted by the two minds.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.880
Then…

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.960
What should we do now?

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:38.599
Wait until he wakes up,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.799
and ask him for a painting.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.780
(Yashe)

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:16.160
Hey.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.160
Su Beilu,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.039
what are you thinking about?

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.039
For some reason,

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:29.279
the image of Zhao Wanli looking at
Autumn Gift to a Friend

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:31.000
while laughing and crying

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.279
just keeps replaying in my mind.

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:36.880
The two of them never even met,

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.680
they didn't exchange a single word.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.279
Yet, through painting,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.680
and through poetry,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.400
they became each other's
only confidant for life.

00:21:50.079 --> 00:21:52.079
The bonds between people

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.599
really are something magical.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:55.119
They are.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.960
Throughout one's life,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.240
true friends and confidants

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.400
are incredibly rare.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.319
And you?

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.960
Don't ask whether I've had one.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.559
I did, once.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720
He's gone now.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.799
But still,

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.920
I've gained another good friend.

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:30.400
Actually,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.160
all those years in the past,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.160
I'd always been on my own,

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:36.839
travelling to search
for those lost artifacts.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.200
Every place I went,

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.400
once I found what I was looking for,

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:43.680
I would leave immediately,

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:45.359
never staying a moment longer.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.920
This era is actually

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.079
the one I stayed in the longest.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.480
Ninghai,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.480
an island resting on a calm sea.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:08.319
Truly beautiful.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.359
Anyone there?

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.000
Is the boss in?

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:28.599
There's a customer.

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:29.720
I'll go.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:31.839
Coming.

00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:29.039
Energy anomaly eliminated.

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.400
(This was the final piece.)

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.920
(I've completed my atonement.)

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.559
(It's time to return Yashe)

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.200
(and go back to my own era.)

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.200
Display my time travel return point.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.079
Eleven years.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.799
Every era has too many adverts.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.480
Boss, could you come over?

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.960
A customer wants to buy something.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:51.799
Coming.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:26:00.660
(Dushan Jade. A witness to dynasties.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.740
(Fusheng Hall)

00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:29.200
Esteemed collectors
from around the world,

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:32.759
I'm Ye Liangyin,
auctioneer of Fusheng Hall.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.720
This auction will take place
at the end of the month.

00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:39.319
This is the item up for auction.

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:41.519
To obtain it,

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:43.799
we paid an enormous price.

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:44.880
Now,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.160
please enjoy this exceptionally
well-preserved treasure.

(Ye Liangyin,
Auctioneer of Fusheng Hall)

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.039
(Today)

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.640
(is the day of farewell.)

00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:52.920
Su Beilu?

00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:57.160
Su Beilu?

Tuanzi.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.240
Su Beilu?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.480
There's something
very important to tell you.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.519
I never told you

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.759
about this surprise.

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:46.160
A surprise?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.880
So?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.200
Is it comfortable to sit in?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.079
Does it look cool?

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:57.599
Master Dong,

00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:59.519
no one says "cool" like that anymore.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.480
Really?

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.079
No way.

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:02.720
Wait.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.680
See?

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.119
Mr. Bi gets me.

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:05.759
Right?

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:06.400
No.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.240
So where exactly are we going?

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.680
Xiasha Island.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.400
Su Beilu said you wanted to go out,
so we picked Xiasha Island.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.240
I wanted to go out?

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.440
Just pretend I did.

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:19.519
It's the weekend anyway,
everyone's free.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.920
Think of it as team bonding.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.200
I've always wanted
to go to Xiasha Island.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.160
Come to think of it,
I've never been camping.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.359
Let's make some good memories together.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.640
The sea!

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.519
I'm here!

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.240
The sea!

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.240
I'm here!

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.160
Tuanzi, let's go.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:52.519
Why the rush?

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.559
Wait for me!

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.319
Look at the boss, he's so composed.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.200
Why are you all rushing?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.720
That's wrong.

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:19.240
Wrong!

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.440
You did it wrong.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.599
The instructions say

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:24.359
you have to do it

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.000
like this,

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.359
insert it at an angle.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.759
Do you camp often?

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:30.640
Of course not.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:33.240
If we camped all the time,

00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:35.759
we wouldn't even
struggle to pitch a tent.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.960
Most days,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.480
we live in cities

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.240
of steel and concrete,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.720
everything cold and rigid.

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:50.400
It's nothing like this.

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:53.279
Now, it's sunshine and beaches,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.279
and sea breeze!

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:56.000
It just lifts your mood.

00:30:57.319 --> 00:30:58.119
Yeah.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.079
Pity chances like this
are getting rarer.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.319
Come on.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.839
Do it with me.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.680
Like this.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.480
What are you doing?

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.480
Just try it.

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:13.680
No, it's too silly.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.799
Hurry up.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.599
That's it.

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:33.680
So?

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.240
Doesn't it...

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.680
feel really nice?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.240
Super relaxing.

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:40.920
It feels like

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.759
you've become part of nature.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.480
You don't like it?

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:03.839
No, I really like it.

00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:08.079
I like how the sand
slowly slips through my fingers.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.079
The gentle sea breeze
brushes past my face.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.319
My sweat

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.680
mixed with fine grains of sand.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.839
I also like

00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.440
this terribly put-together tent.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.200
I like everything here, Su Beilu.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.240
Thank you.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.920
That's more like it.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.440
Come on.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.240
Let's finish setting up the tent,

00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:43.039
or we'll have nowhere to sleep tonight.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.519
Come on.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.880
Lift this side.

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:04.240
Are you two a couple?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.880
Couples get half price.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.519
Yes.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.359
Still missing something.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.839
Still not quite there.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:45.359
Alright, hold that pose and don't move.

00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:46.000
Thirty minutes.

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.039
Thirty minutes?

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.039
Miss,

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.880
I'm painting, not taking photos.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.599
Thirty minutes will fly by.
Hang in there.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.039
Yeah.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.640
It'll be done soon.

00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:57.319
Just hold on.

00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:58.480
Okay.

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:01.559
Don't move.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.319
Hold the same pose as before.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.119
It's actually pretty cute.

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.920
You know what,
it really does look like you.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:30.079
You look like it too.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.159
Look at those big eyes.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.559
Time to pay.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.280
- I'll pay.
- I will.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.119
- I'll do it.
- Me.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:36.920
I've got it.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.679
Let me pay for it.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.519
No, I asked you to draw this.

00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:40.599
I can't let you pay too.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.119
It's scanned.

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:44.039
Alright, you go ahead.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.639
Done pretending after it's done?

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.400
I...

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.480
This is just how we usually get along.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.280
Yeah.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.320
That's nice.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.800
Honestly, you two suit each other.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.239
Alright then, we'll get going.

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:04.800
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.440
Go on.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.679
Wait.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:13.039
Love bubbles.

00:35:13.199 --> 00:35:14.039
For couples only.

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:14.920
Have fun.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.400
Thank you.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.519
You're welcome.

00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:19.320
Thanks a lot.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.480
Who'd play with something this childish?

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:37.960
Why does he like
bubble solution so much?

00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:39.920
Come to think of it,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.560
he's been like this since he was little.

00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:43.920
This kid is really something.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.320
One bottle of bubbles and he's gone.

00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:04.400
Miss,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.800
do I get bubble solution with a drawing?

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:08.000
Do one for me.

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.400
Sir,

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:14.000
it's for couples only.

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:15.119
Couples only?

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.039
Fine, forget it.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.400
Looking down on single people, huh?
