00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.719
Email from Galileo

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.200
Galileo

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.479
Another email.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.280
Such high efficiency.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.759
I've reviewed your proposal.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.600
I want to see

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
a report backed by data.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.039
Rejected, right?

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:54.799
Data.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.679
Data.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.119
If data is so important,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.119
what do you need us for?

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.600
Are we just data porters?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.679
We're not data porters.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.000
We're data's

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.760
human hard drives.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.000
Calm down.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.120
Six-thirty tonight.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.799
See you at Chateau Delight.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.280
I have to work overtime.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.319
Might be a bit late.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.480
Not allowed.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.959
If you're late, your pay gets halved.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.519
Have I been cursed with bad romance luck lately?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.799
What kind of scumbags are these males?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.959
But after all,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.840
he's the Client King.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.040
Don't worry, babe.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.599
I'll get there as soon as I can.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.039
This refined guy...

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.479
When he's not talking,

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.759
he's actually quite handsome.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.439
Sorry.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.960
Our company

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.439
had a visit today from a

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.479
perverted chairman.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:28.639
I've been busy the whole time,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.599
so I'm late.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.439
My dad's spies are everywhere.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.639
Tonight is a tough battle.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.039
Stay alert at all times.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.199
Okay.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.919
They seem to be watching us.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.719
What do we do?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.719
Watch me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.560
Welcome!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.120
This is your

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.039
most correct choice.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.199
Does your family run a security company?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.960
You're really putting on a show.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.240
Contract clause forty-seven:

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.919
Do not inquire about the other party's privacy.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:16.400
Then let's go.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.240
This falls under

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.960
S+ level intimacy.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.560
It's charged by the second.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.000
Welcome!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.439
This is your most correct choice.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.479
Are you insane?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.560
This French restaurant...

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.240
Their foie gras risotto is delicious.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.159
Try some.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.280
Good evening, sir.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.000
Ah, Miss Coco.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.120
Long time no see.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.280
Long time no see.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.120
You know each other?

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.240
We're terribly sorry,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.719
but we're fully booked today.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.439
For any inconvenience caused,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.719
we are deeply apologetic.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.439
What?

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.919
You're not welcoming me?

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.960
The internet celebrity, Miss Coco.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.520
How would we dare?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.759
We can't afford to offend you.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.840
What did you do to this place?

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.759
Nothing much.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.120
I just wrote an article

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.159
when I visited before

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.680
and posted it on Little Blue Book.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.719
I just wrote down

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.639
my genuine feelings.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.680
I think

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
you two should go to another restaurant.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.600
That Sha County Snacks across the street

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.439
looks quite good.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.759
Please call your manager over.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.519
Thank you.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.319
Sorry,

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.240
our manager happens to be out today.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.839
Manager!

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.519
We just got word.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.439
Pink Chubby Pig,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.519
the influencer blogger,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920
is also dining at our restaurant today.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.560
The boss told us to prioritize them.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.759
Pink Chubby Pig...

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.120
...is none other than myself.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.360
You...

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.000
Aren't you

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.160
Miss Coco?

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.120
Also me.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.519
So you're that pig.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.000
Excuse me.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.600
Sorry, you two.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.639
This table today

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.800
was specially reserved for you by our boss.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.600
Please wait a moment.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.519
Come here, quick!

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.680
This...

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.240
is a little token of appreciation from the boss.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.360
Wishing you both

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.120
a pleasant meal.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.839
Thank you.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.839
Just standard procedure.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.680
Hello?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.199
Chairman.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.399
Over there,

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.360
everything is deployed.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.720
We've set up a tight net.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.959
Live-streaming the whole thing.

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.279
Very good.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.319
What's wrong over there?

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.160
Why can't I hear their voices?

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.959
Chairman,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160
our listening device

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.879
has malfunctioned.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.519
But don't worry.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:37.800
After we get back,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.759
we'll use lip-reading

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.759
and translate it for you word for word.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.439
Those two aren't intimate enough.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.360
I don't like wasabi.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.480
Deal with it.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.800
Can we have less spice?

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.079
No.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:36.160
Mr. Wen

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.399
If there's too much physical contact,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.839
I suggest you choose

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.720
the time-block

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Worry-Free Package.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.800
There's such a considerate package?

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.319
How much does it cost?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.639
I've launched several

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.399
packages.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.800
You can take a look.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.360
Give me a brief introduction.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.639
The Worry-Free Package:

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.199
Nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.199
four contacts per hour,

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.519
buy four get one free.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.000
I think this Delight Package looks good.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.560
Six hundred and ninety-eight yuan,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.519
three times.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.120
If you put it that way,

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.639
the Supreme Bliss Package is more cost-effective.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.399
One thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight yuan,

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.639
eight times.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.560
You really are a shrewd businessman.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.839
Then the first one.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.720
Nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.639
Remember to go back tonight

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.800
and fill out the supplementary contract.

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:28.319
The progress is too slow.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.240
At this rate,

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.839
when will we ever kiss?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.519
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:33.920
What do you know?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.800
Nowadays, in everything,

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.120
you have to talk about efficiency.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.839
When it comes to dating,

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.759
it's even more about efficiency.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:39.959
The emperor isn't anxious,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.319
but the eunuch is.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680
This date

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.120
is way too simple.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.160
What?

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:51.560
At the very least,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.160
we should kiss, right?

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:55.079
Sorry,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
we need to kiss.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.879
Are you insane?

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:02.639
Five times.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.439
They kissed!

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:11.079
They kissed!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.399
Confirmed, they kissed!

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.399
Starting now,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.120
full coverage live broadcast mode.

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:51.240
This is good.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:52.120
Full coverage.

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:56.919
Everyone gets a bonus chicken leg!

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.559
Received.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.200
Wrap it up.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.080
Wen Pei'an,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.919
I need to talk to you

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:32.240
about the boundaries of this date.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.440
You...

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.879
You're a pervert, aren't you?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.039
Why did you enter my room without knocking?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.399
If I had knocked before entering,

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.480
would I have been able to see this?

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.519
What do you mean by this?

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:46.360
Aren't you ruining my image?
