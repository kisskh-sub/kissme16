=Season 1=

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

=Episode 24=

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.560
Are they capable?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.760
They're done.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.799
No good at all.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.840
You better speak less.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.519
Master Dong.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.479
Half-time break.

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:22.875
Wait.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:24.516
I'll take care of those two guys.

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:26.315
If you get the ball, pass it to me.

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:26.995
Boss.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:27.755
You're tall.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:29.275
You'll be responsible for spikes

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:29.916
or blocking.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:34.875
You not feeling well?

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:35.595
No.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:36.236
I'm fine.

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:38.676
Boss, look.

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.836
It's rare for us to get out like this.

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:42.396
Who knows when it'll be next time?

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.116
You really want to win?

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:48.155
Of course.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:51.636
The game restarts.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.356
Come on.

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:55.396
Go!

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:56.196
Go for it!

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:57.236
Go!

00:02:57.236 --> 00:02:58.676
Come on!

00:02:58.676 --> 00:02:59.236
Here.

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:04.516
Nice shot!

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.315
Nice shot!

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.275
Red team wins!

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:05.116
Beautiful!

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:09.275
I let you win, but not this much.

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:15.035
Hey.

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:16.715
Help pick up a ball.

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:24.876
Sorry about that.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:25.876
Master.

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:28.275
Master Dong.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:29.355
You've done well.

00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:30.915
Even though you got hit,

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:33.275
you got us the inn from Madam Lin.

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:35.795
These are all dried up.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:37.396
These weren't brushed.
I brushed these.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.396
- Su Beilu.
- You can't do it yet.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:40.316
You should do it last.
Why did you do it now?

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:41.636
You blew all this to my side.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.115
Take these away first.

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:45.516
Come try Chun Ge's
roasted chicken wings.

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.836
Crispy outside, tender inside.

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.076
Sweet with salty.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:49.155
Salty with spicy.

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:50.516
Here.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:51.636
Let's have some red wine.

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:52.475
You

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:53.436
even thought of this,

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:54.556
so thoughtful of you.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:57.275
Welcome to my little forest courtyard.

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:59.155
- Come, cheers!
- Cheers!

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.556
The method I taught you
is very relaxing, right?

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.275
You grew up by the sea.

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:53.235
How come you can't swim?

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:55.915
You future people aren't
immortal either.

00:05:58.155 --> 00:05:58.996
Makes sense.

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:04.355
When I was little,

00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:06.355
my parents were always busy with work.

00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:08.475
No one taught me to swim.

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:10.076
Later,

00:06:10.196 --> 00:06:11.675
I lived at my grandma's house.

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:13.196
She always told me

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.996
that she'd take me to see the sea
during holidays.

00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:18.196
But when holidays came,

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:19.516
she was always busy at the store.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.035
Later when I grew up,
I wanted to take her there,

00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:27.235
but never got the chance.

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:32.595
Sorry.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.196
No need to apologize.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:37.915
Actually, when I was little,

00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:40.636
I didn't appreciate her.

00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:42.795
Why?

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:55.475
Huang.

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:56.275
Look.

00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:57.595
Blowing bubbles.

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.436
Su Beilu.

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:08.196
Su Beilu.

00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:10.795
What are you doing?

00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:12.956
What's in your hand?

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:14.155
Give it to me.

00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:15.876
No.

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:19.996
What is this?

00:07:20.556 --> 00:07:21.836
Did you take it from the store?

00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:24.795
Playing with the dog again?

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:26.196
Wash your hands at home.

00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:26.956
Let's go.

00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:29.715
Go.

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:31.396
I'm not going home.

00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:34.035
I need to buy watercolor pens
for tomorrow's art class.

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.556
Aren't there watercolor pens
at the store?

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:37.715
Why waste money?

00:07:37.996 --> 00:07:38.355
Go home.

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:39.196
Grandma.

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.636
Those at the store are crayons.

00:07:41.115 --> 00:07:42.595
I want watercolor pens.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:43.155
Let's go.

00:08:09.396 --> 00:08:10.316
Su Beilu.

00:08:10.316 --> 00:08:11.556
Is this your mom?

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:12.915
This is my grandma.

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:14.795
The color of your grandma's clothes

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:17.196
looks like stir-fried eggplant
with scallions.

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:21.076
What's going on?

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:22.316
Everyone back to your seats.

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:24.876
Long, are you done drawing?

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:26.355
You're distracting other students.

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.516
Miss, I'm just reminding Su Beilu.

00:08:28.556 --> 00:08:31.436
He didn't bring watercolor pens
as required.

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:32.916
But you still can't distract others.

00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:33.755
Sit down.

00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:34.956
Continue drawing.

00:08:39.956 --> 00:08:42.090
It's fine. I will bring you watercolor pens
next time.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.115
Your drawing is good.

00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:43.875
Keep going.

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:52.156
Where to put it?

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.436
Here.

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:56.715
Okay, let me see.

00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:57.595
Eight Fanta.

00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:58.875
The rest are Coke, right?

00:08:58.995 --> 00:08:59.676
Got it.

00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:00.995
Thanks.

00:09:00.995 --> 00:09:02.176
(Feng Ying Mini-Mart)

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:07.276
Su Beilu, you're back.

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:09.755
Su Beilu.

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:14.395
Bei.

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:15.635
Bei.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:18.235
Bei.

00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:21.515
Bei.

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:24.276
Bei.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.556
What's wrong?

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:27.836
If something's wrong, tell grandma.

00:09:30.276 --> 00:09:30.956
Bei.

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:32.875
I will make you dinner,

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:34.436
make something tasty for you.

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:36.595
Come out later to eat.

00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:41.556
What's going on with this kid?

00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:09.875
When I was little,

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:12.676
she sold things at the mini-mart.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.355
They were always
the oldest-looking stuff.

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:16.836
I was always embarrassed
in front of classmates.

00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.475
What she picked

00:10:18.676 --> 00:10:20.556
always the most outdated items.

00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:22.956
I argued with her many times.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:23.875
Do you know

00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:26.995
why I was so happy
to see bubble water today?

00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:29.796
Because

00:10:32.076 --> 00:10:33.395
when I see bubble water,

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.475
I think of her.

00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:37.076
She used

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:40.595
to love selling these little things.

00:10:47.475 --> 00:10:48.956
I used to always think,

00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:53.355
if my parents were still here,

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:57.036
there wouldn't be so many
unhappy things.

00:10:59.036 --> 00:10:59.875
But,

00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:02.316
after I secretly

00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:06.076
used Yashe to save my parents last time,

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:08.395
I changed my mind.

00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:13.436
Actually, grandma is the one
who raised me.

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:17.355
When I was young and clueless,

00:11:17.715 --> 00:11:18.995
I always got mad at her,

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:21.556
always complained about her.

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:24.796
When grown up,

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:27.235
I became more sensible,

00:11:30.395 --> 00:11:32.156
yet had no chance to treat her well.

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:45.395
Our life is really short.

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:48.156
Family

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:50.316
is often

00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:52.475
the most easily overlooked.

00:11:54.036 --> 00:11:56.875
We put it behind
many other relationships,

00:11:59.395 --> 00:12:01.316
just because it comes too easily.

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:06.235
But

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.715
as the days go by,

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.355
we selectively block

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:14.036
or even forget

00:12:15.156 --> 00:12:16.156
the pain,

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:17.755
sorrow,

00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:19.916
and loss.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:23.635
Leaving only beautiful memories.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.556
Just like the bubble water
at grandma's store.

00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:32.496
♪The fairy tale I held so tight slips
through my fingers like sand♪

00:12:35.096 --> 00:12:38.616
♪Time, oh time, can we pause the time?♪

00:12:39.196 --> 00:12:40.276
Do you have a wish?

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.956
Even if I say it, it's useless.

00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:47.715
Why?

00:12:47.715 --> 00:12:48.715
Say it.

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:54.136
♪We said we'd grow up,
I showed up right on time♪

00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:58.475
If only I could cherish

00:12:58.475 --> 00:13:00.156
the time with grandma,

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:05.755
maybe there wouldn't be so many regrets.

00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:11.156
But

00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:13.595
I feel very fortunate to meet

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:15.875
such a good boss like you.

00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:19.276
I think it must be grandma blessing me.

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:23.916
It definitely must be.

00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:25.515
What about you?

00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:26.475
Do you have a wish?

00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:28.316
I

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:31.115
don't have one.

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:32.156
Impossible.

00:13:32.475 --> 00:13:33.755
How can someone have no wishes?

00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:35.036
Really don't have any.

00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:38.956
Recovering lost artifacts
from different eras

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:40.836
is my greatest wish.

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:44.995
Alright then.

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:47.635
Maybe after you

00:13:47.635 --> 00:13:49.395
complete this wish,

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:50.916
you can think of the next one.

00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:52.836
Just like I come up with a new wish

00:13:53.595 --> 00:13:55.715
every year on my birthday.

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:00.796
So,

00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:02.156
think now.

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.076
What your next wish is?

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:09.096
♪Let the waves that left
and came back wash over my feet again♪

00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:13.656
♪We said we'd grow up,
I showed up right on time♪

00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:17.496
♪Knowing it would hurt, I still set out♪

00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:18.875
I actually thought of one.

00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:20.556
What is it?

00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:23.635
If I say it, it won't work.

00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:28.556
Will you tell the wishes

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:29.796
you make on your birthday?

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:32.436
Exactly.

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:50.395
Let's go.

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:51.635
Thanks.

00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:19.635
Go, Tuanzi.

00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:21.595
Miss Lin Zhong.

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.196
(Lin Zhong Guesthouse)
We'll come again next time.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.395
Always welcome.

00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:25.875
Come again?

00:15:26.076 --> 00:15:27.755
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:28.916
Still didn't sleep well?

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:30.115
The snoring was so loud.

00:15:30.115 --> 00:15:31.156
Impossible.

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.676
Your mattress isn't good.

00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:35.676
Next time I'll recommend a good one.

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.755
Thanks, no need.

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:39.635
Oh right.

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:42.196
Last night I painted a picture
as a gift for everyone.

00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:42.995
Let me see.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.115
Miss Lin Zhong, when did you paint this?

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:45.956
Amazing.

00:15:45.956 --> 00:15:46.635
So cute.

00:15:46.635 --> 00:15:47.316
Miss Lin Zhong.

00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:49.436
You're secretly a recluse artist,
aren't you?

00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:50.235
How is it?

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:51.715
The scene is lively.

00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:52.995
Colors are bold.

00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:53.520
Professional.

00:15:54.796 --> 00:15:55.355
Master Dong.

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:56.156
Look.

00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:56.836
Like it?

00:15:58.156 --> 00:15:59.755
I agree with everything else.

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:01.355
What do you mean by this?

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:02.956
I'm just recording it truthfully.

00:16:02.956 --> 00:16:05.076
You drank too much last night.
Yes, that's true.

00:16:05.076 --> 00:16:05.755
Impossible.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:08.436
I've never gotten drunk
since I learned to drink.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.156
- We're leaving, Miss Lin Zhong.
- Bye, Miss Lin Zhong.

00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:12.875
Bye.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.036
If I were really drunk,
could I drive today?

00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:19.076
See how energetic I am now.

00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:19.755
Right?

00:16:19.956 --> 00:16:20.515
Yes.

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:22.475
Let's go.

00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:23.196
Bye.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.796
Bye.

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:25.956
Let's go.

00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:42.956
Good times are always short.

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:45.316
Tomorrow we go back to work.

00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:48.956
What now?

00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:50.475
I'll see you home.

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:55.475
Let's go to Yashe.

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:57.436
Okay.

00:17:01.635 --> 00:17:03.395
You still have to work overtime today?

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:07.155
I was worried I had nothing to do.

00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:09.955
Can you help me take Tuanzi home later?

00:17:12.996 --> 00:17:13.915
I sympathize with you.

00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:11.195
Before the team-building,

00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:14.476
I cleaned everything here.

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:16.635
Just thinking

00:18:17.756 --> 00:18:20.155
it'll still be clean when I return.

00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:32.955
Su Beilu.

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:34.516
You're leaving, right?

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:46.076
All the artifacts are collected.

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:48.756
Right?

00:18:53.036 --> 00:18:54.276
Without your help,

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:57.716
I couldn't have collected
all these artifacts so quickly.

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:00.355
Thank you.

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:07.435
Congratulations, Bizhi.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.955
You've completed your wish.

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:21.435
This team-building trip

00:19:22.756 --> 00:19:24.595
is a gift I give to you.

00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:26.796
How about it?

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:28.316
Happy?

00:19:39.435 --> 00:19:40.195
Yes.

00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:52.435
I remember you described the future
to me.

00:19:57.076 --> 00:19:58.716
You said it's cold there

00:20:01.036 --> 00:20:02.395
and it makes you unhappy.

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:04.556
I hope

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:07.635
our memories from this time

00:20:09.996 --> 00:20:11.355
can make you

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:13.476
smile more in the future.

00:20:15.155 --> 00:20:16.155
I also hope

00:20:16.955 --> 00:20:18.516
you will always remember

00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.236
these friends from the 21st century.

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:26.595
I will definitely remember.

00:20:28.076 --> 00:20:29.155
I'll remember Chun Ge,

00:20:29.276 --> 00:20:30.076
Xiaomin,

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.155
Master Dong

00:20:31.556 --> 00:20:32.915
and you, Su Beilu.

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:36.716
Remember these good friends.

00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:38.756
Remember this era.

00:20:40.996 --> 00:20:42.115
Remember to smile more.

00:20:54.236 --> 00:20:55.675
Check it when you get home.

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:58.115
Okay.

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:04.595
You used to leave first,

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:07.716
I close the shop.

00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:11.276
Today I want to leave first.

00:21:18.716 --> 00:21:19.516
Then...

00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:24.155
Goodbye, boss.

00:21:27.476 --> 00:21:28.595
Goodbye, Su Beilu.

00:24:47.756 --> 00:24:49.236
(When you see this letter,)

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:51.836
(I've already returned to my own era.)

00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:55.352
(I will seal Yashe along)

00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:57.395
(with the artifacts
from the Treasure Trove,)

00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.155
(and never open it again.)

00:24:59.595 --> 00:25:01.316
(Never time-travel again.)

00:25:02.435 --> 00:25:04.155
(We will never meet again.)

00:25:05.955 --> 00:25:07.395
(I don't know how to face you,)

00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:08.476
(and I don't know)

00:25:08.675 --> 00:25:09.955
(how to make it up to you.)

00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:13.036
(Do you remember what I said before?)

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:16.716
(I don't dare intersect
with other people's timelines)

00:25:17.236 --> 00:25:19.395
(because it would bring misfortune
to others.)

00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:22.675
(I didn't mean to hide it.)

00:25:23.476 --> 00:25:24.195
(But I)

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.915
(only found out about something
a few days ago.)

00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:29.796
(Your parents' car accident back then)

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.115

00:25:54.355 --> 00:25:55.635
(It has appeared again.)

00:25:57.875 --> 00:25:59.395
(To retrieve an artifact,)

00:25:59.796 --> 00:26:01.716
(I once attended a private auction)

00:26:01.716 --> 00:26:03.756
(in Huayang in 2005)

00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:05.195
(After the transaction ended,)

00:26:05.195 --> 00:26:06.716
(the artifact was taken away.)

00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:08.675
(Now it has appeared again.)

00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:10.516
(I felt it was suspicious.)

00:26:11.435 --> 00:26:13.836
(So I decided to go back
to 2005 to check.)

00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:16.875
(But I discovered a shocking fact.)

00:27:18.316 --> 00:27:19.435
Mom!

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:45.635
(Before that,)

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:47.635
(I had no idea)

00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:48.996
(before)

00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:50.675
(the car that stole the artifact)

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:54.076
(was the hit-and-run
that killed your parents.)

00:27:56.355 --> 00:27:58.316
(If I hadn't chased the car
from behind,)

00:27:58.915 --> 00:28:00.716
(the accident might never
have happened.)

00:28:05.635 --> 00:28:06.635
(Su Beilu.)

00:28:07.155 --> 00:28:08.076
(I'm sorry.)

00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:15.635
Bizhi.

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:19.076
Bizhi.

00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:32.616
(Su Beilu, I'm sorry, From Bizhi)

00:29:02.776 --> 00:29:06.576
(Half a month later)

00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:07.556
Come, Su.

00:29:07.556 --> 00:29:08.595
Come inside quickly.

00:29:08.595 --> 00:29:09.716
Look at this room.

00:29:09.716 --> 00:29:10.875
The furniture and decor

00:29:12.155 --> 00:29:13.595
are still the same.

00:29:19.836 --> 00:29:21.595
These little decorations are quite nice.

00:29:21.595 --> 00:29:23.036
- Miss Jenny, let me.
- Don't move.

00:29:23.635 --> 00:29:24.435
Miss Jenny.

00:29:25.036 --> 00:29:26.236
Thank you for letting me stay.

00:29:26.756 --> 00:29:28.435
I was worried about the house.

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:30.996
Look at you, what are you saying?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.620
A good neighbor is better
than a brother far off.

00:29:32.635 --> 00:29:33.355
People's hearts

00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:34.516
are made of flesh.

00:29:35.516 --> 00:29:36.276
But

00:29:36.915 --> 00:29:38.316
you're really not raising the rent?

00:29:38.915 --> 00:29:40.115
And let me keep Tuanzi.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.996
It's called Little Tuanzi, right?

00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:45.875
How is Little Tuanzi so cute?

00:29:46.996 --> 00:29:49.875
Little Tuanzi is getting cuter
and cuter.

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:51.476
I have to leave now.

00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:52.875
Call me if you need anything.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:53.996
Alright, I'll go then.

00:29:53.996 --> 00:29:55.516
- Miss Jenny, I'll see you off.
- No need.

00:29:55.516 --> 00:29:56.355
Stay.

00:29:57.036 --> 00:29:57.435
Stay.

00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:58.595
Goodbye, Miss Jenny.

00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:03.316
Can't even sell it.

00:30:03.716 --> 00:30:05.915
I can't handle it if it's vacant
for a few more months.

00:30:26.316 --> 00:30:26.756
Release.

00:31:23.836 --> 00:31:25.195
Here. I'll give you the cat.

00:31:25.195 --> 00:31:26.355
Sorry about that.

00:31:26.355 --> 00:31:27.155
Wait a bit.

00:31:27.155 --> 00:31:27.595
Wait.

00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:28.836
It's too crowded now.

00:31:30.915 --> 00:31:31.556
Dr. Tang.

00:31:32.155 --> 00:31:33.435
It's really too busy.

00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:34.036
I really...

00:31:34.036 --> 00:31:34.996
I'll go get busy.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.516
Dr. Tang. I just happen
to have something to tell you. Come.

00:31:37.836 --> 00:31:38.316
Go ahead.

00:31:38.476 --> 00:31:39.635
Isn't it now

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.155
busier with patients?

00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:42.195
Dr. Tang!

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.516
Miss Chen asked if you could see
her dog first since she's in a hurry?

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.435
That won't do. Look at
how many patients there are.

00:31:46.435 --> 00:31:47.595
Let her wait a bit more.

00:31:47.595 --> 00:31:48.236
I'll tell her.

00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:49.395
Okay, go ahead.

00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:51.635
I just want to discuss with you.

00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:52.716
Discuss what? Go ahead.

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:53.435
Dr. Tang.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.435
Has Keke's prescription been written?

00:31:55.435 --> 00:31:56.540
Should I take the medicine to him?

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:57.996
It's been done. Go help him get it.

00:31:57.996 --> 00:31:59.476
I really don't have time. Go ahead.

00:31:59.476 --> 00:31:59.836
Alright.

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:00.355
Xiaomin.

00:32:00.476 --> 00:32:02.195
Don't come back until I finish talking.

00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:08.036
Just see if it can be reversed.

00:32:10.996 --> 00:32:11.875
Are you okay, manager?

00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:13.996
What are you doing again?

00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:14.756
Just so.

00:32:14.756 --> 00:32:15.796
I can tell you something.

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.756
I really can't keep up.

00:32:17.915 --> 00:32:20.236
Spring is the peak season
for cat and dog illnesses.

00:32:20.395 --> 00:32:22.635
The inpatient ward is full,
not to mention the ER.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.476
We're so busy we don't even
have time to eat.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.355
Ask Dr. Tang how many extra shifts
he's worked?

00:32:26.355 --> 00:32:28.756
- I've been at it for seven days.
- Yeah. Alright.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.290
You guys are busy. I'm not busy, right?

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:31.516
I don't understand you guys.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.635
Wasn't I trying to hire people
but couldn't?

00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:35.076
Aren't you pressuring me?

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.516
Am I not having a hard time?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.076
You walked off
before I finished talking.

00:32:38.076 --> 00:32:39.955
- Do you respect me?
- Manager.

00:32:39.955 --> 00:32:42.036
What exactly do you want to tell me?

00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:46.355
Think it through and then tell me.

00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:50.556
Every day is so exhausting.

00:32:50.556 --> 00:32:52.195
When will it ever end?

00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:55.355
Is the manager seriously recruiting?

00:32:55.476 --> 00:32:56.716
Where are the people?

00:32:57.556 --> 00:32:58.716
You two young ones.

00:32:58.716 --> 00:33:00.836
What's going on with you guys?

00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:02.796
Look at me.

00:33:03.635 --> 00:33:05.476
I can't hold on either.

00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:08.395
They say vet salaries are high.

00:33:08.395 --> 00:33:10.875
But only those who suffer know
how hard it is.

00:33:11.316 --> 00:33:12.115
Dr. Tang.

00:33:12.675 --> 00:33:13.915
Why don't you take a break?

00:33:14.236 --> 00:33:16.036
Or I can get you something to eat.

00:33:16.836 --> 00:33:17.675
Thanks.

00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:19.595
I just want to sit here for a bit.

00:33:19.756 --> 00:33:21.595
I still need to read some scans.

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:23.675
I haven't finished reading my scans.

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.756
Delicious luosifen has arrived.

00:33:26.955 --> 00:33:27.595
Yes.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.556
I forgot I had an appointment with you.

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:31.556
I haven't finished work yet.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.675
You can wait for me a bit.

00:33:33.076 --> 00:33:34.450
It's fine. It's the season change.

00:33:34.476 --> 00:33:35.276
I know you're busy.

00:33:35.476 --> 00:33:36.516
So I brought you Luosifen

00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:39.875
with less spicy,
less smelly, and extra veggies.

00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:40.675
Come and eat.

00:33:40.675 --> 00:33:41.595
Good kid.

00:33:41.595 --> 00:33:42.716
You know I like this.

00:33:43.195 --> 00:33:44.036
Master is here.

00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:45.195
Master is here.

00:33:47.756 --> 00:33:48.836
It's still hot.

00:33:49.155 --> 00:33:50.756
This is too happy.

00:33:51.115 --> 00:33:51.796
So good.

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:52.276
Thank you,

00:33:52.276 --> 00:33:52.955
Su Beilu.

00:33:54.036 --> 00:33:55.355
Where have you been lately?

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.915
Haven't seen you for a long time.

00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:02.115
I've been busy moving.

00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:03.435
Moving?

00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:04.716
Why?

00:34:07.995 --> 00:34:09.236
The boss left.

00:34:09.676 --> 00:34:11.875
I feel uncomfortable living alone

00:34:12.035 --> 00:34:13.515
in such a big house.

00:34:14.035 --> 00:34:17.116
So I told the landlord
I want to move out.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.395
Didn't we just have a team-building
with him?

00:34:20.156 --> 00:34:21.236
Where did he go?

00:34:23.836 --> 00:34:24.756
Back to his hometown.

00:34:27.355 --> 00:34:28.395
Business is hard.

00:34:28.756 --> 00:34:30.475
I think the boss is actually quite nice.

00:34:30.836 --> 00:34:31.796
Will he come back?

00:34:36.316 --> 00:34:37.316
So it seems

00:34:38.515 --> 00:34:40.156
you're unemployed.

00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:43.636
Sort of.

00:34:48.555 --> 00:34:50.555
- That's great!
- That's great!

00:34:52.756 --> 00:34:53.555
No.

00:34:53.636 --> 00:34:55.796
We really aren't kicking you
when you're down.

00:34:56.316 --> 00:34:58.156
It's just too busy.

00:34:58.156 --> 00:34:59.995
So just come back to work quickly.

00:34:59.995 --> 00:35:01.990
I don't want to work overtime
anymore. Hurry back.

00:35:02.035 --> 00:35:04.236
But I caused such big trouble before

00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:05.596
and I'm always clumsy.

00:35:05.596 --> 00:35:06.316
Failed exams too.

00:35:06.316 --> 00:35:07.716
Don't talk about useless things.

00:35:07.716 --> 00:35:08.596
Just tell me.

00:35:08.875 --> 00:35:10.515
Do you like this profession?

00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:11.636
Yes.

00:35:11.836 --> 00:35:12.796
Then that's it.

00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:14.156
Listen.

00:35:14.515 --> 00:35:15.395
Being a vet,

00:35:15.555 --> 00:35:16.636
the important thing

00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.116
is to have a...

00:35:18.475 --> 00:35:20.236
- Pure heart!
- Pure heart!

00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:21.276
Don't worry.

00:35:21.276 --> 00:35:23.156
I'll talk to the manager.

00:35:23.156 --> 00:35:25.156
You just keep your distance.

00:35:25.276 --> 00:35:26.236
Focus on your own work.

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:27.035
Steadily.

00:35:28.995 --> 00:35:29.836
Master.

00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:32.196
I'll go talk to him myself.

00:35:32.515 --> 00:35:34.995
After all, I caused such
big trouble before.

00:35:35.196 --> 00:35:36.395
I want to resolve it myself.

00:35:36.636 --> 00:35:37.555
No problem.

00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:39.890
I said not to prescribe this medicine,
there's no stock!

00:35:40.236 --> 00:35:41.955
Haven't I already signed this?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.875
Why is it here again?

00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:43.995
Who is it?

00:35:45.316 --> 00:35:46.280
What are you doing here?

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.236
Manager. I have something
to discuss with you.

00:35:48.676 --> 00:35:49.955
Manager, also this.

00:35:50.196 --> 00:35:52.716
Can't you just handle
these small matters yourselves?

00:35:52.716 --> 00:35:53.995
It must be signed today.

00:35:56.756 --> 00:35:57.596
So fierce.

00:36:01.676 --> 00:36:03.875
I heard you've been
short-staffed recently.

00:36:04.035 --> 00:36:04.676
Stop.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.796
Last time you left,
you were pretty arrogant.

00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:10.116
Our clinic is too small,

00:36:10.116 --> 00:36:11.555
it can't fit someone like you.

00:36:11.915 --> 00:36:13.130
Can you give me another chance?

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.090
I really want to come back
and continue working.

00:36:15.276 --> 00:36:16.035
I beg you.

00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:16.875
I'm so busy now.

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:19.316
I really don't have the energy
to argue with you.

00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:21.236
With your stubborn personality,

00:36:21.236 --> 00:36:23.716
being a small assistant
would really be beneath you.

00:36:23.716 --> 00:36:25.555
Please find
a better opportunity elsewhere.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.756
Still not leaving?
Should I ask you to leave?

00:36:34.796 --> 00:36:35.236
Zhuang.

00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:35.836
Manager.

00:36:36.035 --> 00:36:37.035
Listen to me.

00:36:37.355 --> 00:36:39.035
I wasn't diligent enough before

00:36:39.555 --> 00:36:40.756
and I was always late.

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:42.676
I kept failing the license exam.

00:36:43.355 --> 00:36:44.116
But

00:36:45.435 --> 00:36:47.756
I really love being with animals,

00:36:48.756 --> 00:36:50.955
helping them gives me a sense
of accomplishment.

00:36:52.515 --> 00:36:54.756
Before, I didn't know how
to cherish this job.

00:36:55.475 --> 00:36:56.995
But I met a friend.

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:58.475
He told me

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.480
that one must take responsibility.

00:37:01.995 --> 00:37:03.156
I have to bear

00:37:03.276 --> 00:37:04.756
my own duties.

00:37:06.196 --> 00:37:06.995
So

00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:12.756
can you reconsider

00:37:13.596 --> 00:37:14.875
and give me another chance?

00:37:15.836 --> 00:37:17.196
I will work hard.

00:37:24.915 --> 00:37:26.035
Su Beilu.

00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.236
I've been waiting for today.

00:37:29.075 --> 00:37:29.875
Our hospital

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:31.116
is indeed quite busy now.

00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:32.475
Three-month probation,

00:37:32.475 --> 00:37:34.276
80% of the salary, is that acceptable?

00:37:34.435 --> 00:37:34.955
No problem.

00:37:34.955 --> 00:37:35.756
Acceptable.

00:37:40.316 --> 00:37:41.490
I haven't touched your locker.

00:37:43.035 --> 00:37:43.850
Thank you, manager.

00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:44.716
Thank you, manager.

00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:47.395
How's that?

00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:55.515
Finally hired someone.

00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:56.796
Quick.

00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:57.875
Add him in.

00:38:24.156 --> 00:38:24.915
Come, over here.

00:38:36.756 --> 00:38:37.636
Look at that.
