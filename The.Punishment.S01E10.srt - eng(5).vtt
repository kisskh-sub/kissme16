Second, find out where the money is now.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.120
It definitely wasn't Song Hao.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.270
He doesn't have the guts.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.070
Okay, Mr. Luo.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.410
I can't believe all this.

We have some leads now.

We can't disclose that yet.

by the first criminal investigation squad
of the Municipal Bureau.

It's under the charge of Officer Qin Feng.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.200
The first criminal investigation squad?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.150
Why them?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.880
I'm not sure.

after hearing that.

for you to say that right now?

Yes.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.690
he didn't meet anyone.

He made a phone call instead.

Song Hao left first.

That's right.

we saw Captain Zhong

But that restaurant

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.350
is a place Ji frequents.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.730
That's pretty normal too.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.330
Well...

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.830
Hanzhou only has a few good restaurants.

why didn't you tell me before?

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.120
It's just speculation.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.440
Wait. Then...

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.880
Then...

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.920
why would Ji do something like that?

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.240

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.340
he always thought for everyone.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.960
he helped them get familiar with the work.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.480
Didn't I just tell you

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.010

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.000

we're both police officers.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.020
I'll stop thinking about it for now.
Stop thinking about it.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.840
Tao.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.830
My wife made some dumplings

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.030
and delivered them to your mom.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.400
She can't eat hospital food

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.270
all the time.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.870
Home-cooked food is better.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.160
Thank you, Captain Ji.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.020
And Mrs. Ji too.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.500
Look at you.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.760
When did you learn to say thank you?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.480
No, I...

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.850
Don't you get it?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.480
Mrs. Ji made dumplings,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.440
but you only thought about his mom.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.720
Why didn't you bring us any?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.550
We're hungry.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.150
Look at the two of you.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.370
Trying to take dumplings from your mom?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.530
I can't believe you.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.580
Go inside.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.180
Come on.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.120
I...

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.110
already asked Luo Bo to handle

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.480
Bole Finance's matter.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.640
As long as Song Hao can keep his cool,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.280
we still have room to maneuver.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.640
If he hides,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.130
Qin Feng won't be able to find him.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.210
Then we'll be safe.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.900
Well, Song Hao

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.710
is so lucky to have

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.290
a father-in-law like you.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.190
No matter what trouble
he causes out there,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.680
as long as he mentions your name,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.980
all the problems will be solved.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.130
If he had listened
to even a fraction of my advice,

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.550
things wouldn't have gotten to this point.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.370
Everyone stumbles when they're young.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.510
Wasn't I the same?

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.640
All these years,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.920
you've been looking out for me.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.580
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
gained everything I have now.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.110
You're different from him.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.580
He's just

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.550
a hopeless case.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.220
Before,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.990
you always had my back.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.950
This time,

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.900
I still need to ask for your help.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:32.600
What do you mean?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.180
[Rome Hotel]

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.520
Have some.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.290
XO.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.390
I won't drink.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.280
I have work at the bureau.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.210
We rarely get together.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.570
Make an exception.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.010
Don't you know me well enough?

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.000
I didn't have many friends
when I was young.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.410
You were the one
who always looked out for me.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.640
I can't make this exception.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been
in this position today.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.420
Don't you agree?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.860
Look at you.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.070
You know everything in your heart,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.990
but you just won't change.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.110
I can't change.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.080
I think this is fine.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.670
It's simple

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.110
and saves a lot of internal friction.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:29.860
Wang.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.920
You asked me out for a reason, right?

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.370
Can't I just treat you to a meal?

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.850
Have you forgotten

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.400
back when we were in school,

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.310
I treated you to a meal

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.070
every weekend?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.900
Don't you remember that?

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.120
How could I forget?

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.760
Given our relationship...

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.290
if there's something,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.160
just say it.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.280
Eating or not isn't important.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:57.610
Okay.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.200
As you wish.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.580
We won't drink.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.610
My son-in-law.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.430
Song Hao?

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.210
What about him?

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.120
I'm not quite sure

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.470
about what exactly he did either.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.440
If it's a matter of life and death,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.700
I'll say nothing more.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.360
If not,

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.720
please show mercy.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.400
Song Hao is timid

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.830
and inexperienced.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.520
Someone set a trap for him,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.610
and he fell into it.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.160
He helped others make money,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.220
but now he's become their scapegoat.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:47.860
Uncle.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.790
About Song Hao's matter,

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.400
I do know a little.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.340
Indeed, it's nothing serious.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.800
It's just that during the process,
there was a small...

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.880
a small oversight.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.570
Junior,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.560
we've been friends for decades.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.990
You also know

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.010
my wife passed away early.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.070
I raised

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.900
my daughter all by myself.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.010
Her child with Song Hao

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.490
is still little.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.820
If something happens to him,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.250
wouldn't that be the end of me?

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.870
I'm using our decades of friendship

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.410
to ask you to show mercy.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.310
I'm begging you—please.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.770
Senior,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.020
this isn't a matter
of our personal feelings.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.720
I'm not very sure

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.520
about what exactly Song Hao did.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.280
So...

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.060
I can't make you any promises.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.800
Siyuan is your own nephew.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.720
Won't you take care of his matter either?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.440
You two are as close as father and son.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.610
What did you do?

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:15.940
What...

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.110
What... What...

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.260
What did I do?

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.700
In Song Hao's business,

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.760
he is also involved.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.840
That house you just got—

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.750
Siyuan

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.110
went to Song Hao

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.640
to get you a discounted price.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.030
House?

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.130
Uncle,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.000
it was like this.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.480
I... I heard from Aunt

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.270
that you

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.400
wanted a house for retirement.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.290
Song Hao happened to have connections.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:46.810
Right?

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.960
So I asked Song Hao...

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.100
to handle it for you.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.220
He was accused of rape.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.110
You don't know about that either?

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.680
Rape?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.830
Uncle.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.440
I... I was drunk

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.240
that day.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.530
I really was drunk.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.330
I... I don't remember anything.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.180
I don't think

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.390
I... I did anything.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.280
Song Hao asked Ma

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.960
to settle the matter.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.960
Otherwise,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.100
he would've been in jail already.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.160
Junior,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.000
have you thought about this?

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.200
If something happens to Song Hao,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.470
Siyuan can't get away either.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.660
He'll rat him out.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.550
By that time,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.300
me

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.000
and my son-in-law,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.070
you and your nephew, Siyuan—

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.590
we'll put on quite a spectacular show

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.360
for the people of Hanzhou.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.690
The four of us

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.310
are all indispensable.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.510
Wang.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.590
You can take both of them

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.100
and finish this show.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.650
Uncle,

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.210
I... I'll go get the car.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.110
What a coincidence, Director Ye.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.380
Mr. Ma,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.330
this meal was your idea, right?

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.700
We've been friends for so many years.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.490
Why won't you give me any face?

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.460
It's not that I won't give you face.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.790
I'll be honest with you.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.420
I came back to Hanzhou this time

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.950
specifically to investigate you.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.190
No one can stop me.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.210
After you.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.200
It seems we're not going the same way.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.000
You first.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.400
This Song Hao, Song Hao.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.110
Mr. Wang.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.690
Actually,

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.830
I understand you completely.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.920
Look.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.380
Officer Wang.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.620
Dr. Ji.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.400
Do you know where my mom is?

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.470
Shouldn't she be waiting for surgery?

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:47.670
She's not in her ward.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.320
That's strange.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.230
We just told her

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.290
to wait in her ward.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.230
Alright, I got it.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.030
Officer Wang!

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.690
Transplant surgery can't be delayed.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.350
We can wait 40 minutes at most.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.920
It's not easy
to come across a matching kidney source.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.670
And your colleague's tissue typing
wasn't a match.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.360
Hurry up.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.070
My colleague?

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.630
Who?

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.510
The officer surnamed Qin.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.450
Find your mom quickly.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.880
Don't miss the chance.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.070
Tao.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.940
I haven't seen her anywhere.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.290
Any luck over here?

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.780
The doctor said he hasn't seen her either.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.560
Well, Crazy.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.530
Something doesn't feel right.
