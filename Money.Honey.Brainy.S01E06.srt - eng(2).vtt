00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.520
This is

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.359
Lin Meiyi.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.000
Founder of Colorful Tea Drinks.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.759
And this is

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.520
Wen Pei'an,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.079
the CEO of our Four Seas Group.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.920
You give off a vibe

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.799
that's quite different.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.920
Just from hearing your name,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.759
I thought

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.840
you'd be the mature, steady type like my dad.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.560
I absolutely love your company's

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:51.920
Boji Boji Softy Chewy

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.039
Mango Ice Blast.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.759
You two chat first.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.719
I need to make a call.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.320
If you leave, who'll take the meeting minutes?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.000
We still need

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.119
meeting minutes?

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.079
Yes.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.039
Is that a problem?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.799
I have a voice recorder here.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.120
You two go ahead.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.519
Thanks.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:12.359
Hello?

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.920
Chairman.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.359
The blind date has started.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.840
Good.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.200
I strongly suspect Wen Pei'an

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.040
is putting on an act for me.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:20.519
Uncle,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.959
Pei'an wouldn't dare do that.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.000
Are you both in on this, trying to fool me?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.200
I swear to heaven,

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.519
Pei'an really is dating someone.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.120
Alright then.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.599
Go set up a little test for me.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.359
I want to see their genuine reactions.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480
Right now, you can invite Kexin

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.359
to the cafe.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.680
Won't that cause trouble?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.200
Exactly.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.680
We need to stir things up a bit.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.159
I heard

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.239
you've never been in a relationship, is that right?

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.439
What's your zodiac sign?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.640
Does that

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.000
affect our potential cooperation?

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.680
Actually,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.719
I'm just looking for someone

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.680
with a deep soul connection.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120
My philosophy is freedom and openness.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.439
If my needs are adequately met,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.840
I will definitely cast a wide net

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.120
to establish more partnerships.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.599
Both sides

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.840
can benefit.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.159
Why wouldn't we do that?

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.080
Vigorous,

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:12.759
upward,

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.479
innovative,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.199
and striving.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.400
Innovative...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.759
What does that mean?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.439
Boldly discard the old,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.599
embrace the new with open arms.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.919
So, you love the new and loathe the old.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.000
We are both

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.639
free.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.879
Thank you for your honesty.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.840
Thank you for your...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.479
praise.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.800
That wasn't praise.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.879
Are you okay?

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.159
You...

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.159
Stay away from me.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.080
I think our values don't align.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.639
Let's not meet again in the future.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.560
What kind of clients did you find today?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.560
Is it them who have a problem, or is it you?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.560
These

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.759
are just the unique

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.400
social methods

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.479
of modern young entrepreneurs.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.479
You should update your negotiation style too.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.400
Who starts talking business

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.560
right off the bat nowadays?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.639
Hello.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.639
Pashley.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.560
Let me introduce you.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.639
This is Wen Pei'an,

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.039
the CEO of our Four Seas Group.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.360
This is Pashley,

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.080
a guest from afar in Canton City.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.240
Her mother is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.599
the founder of Ai Po.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.240
Hello,

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.240
Miss Pashley.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.879
Hello, Wen Pei'an.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.280
I think

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.560
you're even more handsome in person.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.599
And your muscles feel very firm too.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.719
Do you work out?

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.240
It seems there's an officer outside giving tickets.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.599
I need to go handle that first.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.520
Officer?

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.319
I'm already here.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.400
Where are you?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.360
Target is in sight.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240
I have a question.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.039
Go ahead.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.639
If you were to travel,

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.840
where would you like to go?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.039
As for me,

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.280
I prefer going to Australia.

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.199
The Gold Coast there

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.360
is very beautiful.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.280
Many people don't wear clothes there, you know.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.800
Only people confident in their bodies

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.080
go to that beach.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.400
I think

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:02.120
you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.319
would fit right in.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.360
He's actually on a date.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:10.280
Wait, no.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.039
We're a fake couple.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.639
Why am I getting a bit into the role?

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.039
Snap out of it!

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.720
What's going on here?

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.000
I see.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.480
He asked me here to put on a show.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.480
Hello

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.160
Darling

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:39.480
Sorry

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.120
I'm late

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.759
Who is this young lady?

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:42.920
What are you doing here?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.519
I came here specifically to see you

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.920
You are?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.600
I'm his girlfriend

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.519
I'm discussing business with a client

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.680
Watch your words

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.839
Client?

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.319
Who's the client?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.000
You

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.160
Aren't you here to discuss brand entry?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.680
I'm here for a blind date

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.560
Why is there background music on this livestream?

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.319
To enhance the show's effect

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.279
I specifically added music to the livestream

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.959
Blind date?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.199
You

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.959
actually went behind my back

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.519
and here

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.480
had a blind date with another girl?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.519
I didn't

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.319
Then what do you take me for?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.120
Scumbag!

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.439
Scumbag!

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:30.839
Feeling sorry for the young master for three seconds

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.319
This soap opera plot

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.759
definitely doesn't seem fake

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.800
So fierce!

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.680
That slap was well-deserved

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.079
As expected, handsome men

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.519
with good figures and lots of money

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.399
are all no good

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.519
Sis

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.319
Let me tell you

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.000
I would never be the other woman

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.600
Explain

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.600
what's going on

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.160
What are you doing?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560
What are you doing?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.160
What am I doing?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.720
You come here

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.439
I

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.360
Didn't you ask me to come here?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.560
When did I ask you?

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.040
I advise you to keep your movements subtle

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.079
A lot of people are watching

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.720
Impossible to guard against

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.000
Could it be

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.519
you had no idea

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.680
you were having a blind date here with another girl today?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.759
And wearing the same clothes from our first meeting

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.600
I didn't know

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.680
Then you really should think hard

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.839
about why all this happened today

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:58.040
I'm really angry

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.759
The consequences will be severe

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.639
Paisley left

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:12.839
She's gone

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.959
Ou Lu

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.519
Explain to me

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.319
what exactly happened today

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:25.800
It's just

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.079
I arranged for you to meet some

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.600
guests who are important to the company

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.160
Important guests, huh?

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.199
I'll give you one more chance

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:34.680
Speak properly

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.600
It was arranged by the Chairman

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.120
I'm serving two masters

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.959
Please don't betray me

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.000
If you set me up on another blind date

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.319
tomorrow you'll go to the livestream room

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.040
and shout-rap, headbang, and rave for me

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.800
Also

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.639
All of today's meeting minutes

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.800
email them to me tonight

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.800
I'll do anything you want

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:09.680
Just don't betray me

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.079
Ou Lu told me everything

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.879
Didn't we agree you wouldn't betray me?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.680
Dad

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.959
If you don't trust me

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.319
you could have confronted me directly

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.319
Why resort to these underhanded tricks?

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.920
Alright

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:28.439
I apologize

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.319
for my previous rash actions

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:30.639
Ou Lu

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:31.920
volunteered

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.120
to help prove your case

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.320
He's not at fault

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.679
When did I volunteer?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.279
So the fault is mine then?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.799
No

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.279
You're not at fault either

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.039
The mistake was

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.960
you finding out

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.679
Otherwise

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.600
it would have been a perfect plan

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.639
Alright, alright

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.799
Tomorrow is a good day

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.559
Your father and I

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.440
both want to meet this future daughter-in-law

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.039
Invite her over

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.080
for a meal, okay?

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:04.360
What?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.600
A family dinner?

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:06.799
I'm not going
