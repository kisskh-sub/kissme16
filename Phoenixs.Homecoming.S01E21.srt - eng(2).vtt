=Episode 21=

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:04.560
Don't worry.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:06.239
Maybe His Majesty

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.120
just remembered the Sheng family

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.799
and has some instructions.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.560
This was my mother's dowry back then.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.079
She always cherished it.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Now, it's yours.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.319
Consider it as the Xie family's
betrothal gift.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.719
Look good?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.680
Yes.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.680
This is my betrothal gift.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.840
Grand Tutor Xie, this time,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.719
you won't be able to escape.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.400
No matter how long you go,

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.200
or if the gates are closed,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.560
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.240
Your Majesty.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.400
Sister.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.719
Tell me.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360
Why do people live?

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.639
Sister,

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.479
why do people live?

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.280
Your Majesty,

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.080
why do you say that?

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.479
I don't know.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.759
Looking at you,

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.840
I truly miss my sister.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.800
How about this?

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.800
You'll compose a poem

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.360
for your own sister.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.280
Your Majesty, please speak plainly.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.960
Why speak in riddles with me?

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.759
Right now, a document written
by the Grand Princess

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.599
should be reaching Grand Tutor Xie.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.352
Write another letter

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:21.560
in the Grand Princess's hand.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.240
And in her name,

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.159
accuse the Xie family
of colluding, harming loyal subjects,

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:29.568
and killing the Grand Princess.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.280
They bear responsibility
for the Weiyang Palace incident.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.719
Your Majesty.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.720
(Grand Princess's Letter)

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.319
Are you saying

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.560
this letter

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.680
was left by the Grand Princess
before her death?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.240
It claims I colluded with Chancellor Huo

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.039
to kill the Grand Princess.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.919
I only deliver it.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.720
I know nothing else.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.839
But His Majesty said

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.040
you are clever.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.120
You'll understand
what this letter implies.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.720
Back then, this secretary
in my sister's palace

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.680
copied my sister's
excellent handwriting.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600
She usually skipped

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.399
the routine memorials

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.800
and had him draft responses.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.360
But only Grand Tutor Xie's memorials

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.279
did she handle personally.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.079
Unless my sister comes alive

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:02.480
and personally denies
writing this secret letter,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.839
Grand Tutor Xie's crime

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.800
can't be cleared.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.759
Your Majesty, don't act impulsively

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.959
and hurt a loyal minister.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.839
Won't you admit who you really are?

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.079
Sister,

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.720
Xie Fei could be sentenced
to death this time.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.319
Your Majesty,

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.839
if Grand Tutor Xie is convicted,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.199
I'll follow him in life or death.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.319
There's another way
to exonerate Grand Tutor Xie.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.000
I also have deep ties
with the Sheng family from Yunnan.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.759
If you change your mind now

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.639
and marry me in the palace,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.959
this joyful union between families

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.839
could warrant a general pardon.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.480
You're insane!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.839
Yes.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.959
I am insane.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.399
I've gone mad.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.920
Only madness explains how you all

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.199
could manipulate me so easily.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.319
Even now,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.720
I'm still speaking calmly to you.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.720
Instead of deposing the empress
and marrying you outright.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.959
I'm still afraid of frightening you.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.360
No.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.720
Not mad enough.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.240
I'm not mad enough yet.

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.416
- Your Majesty!
- Sister, don't push me away.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.079
Your Majesty.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.480
I trapped you

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.879
in Weiyang Palace.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.120
I gave them the opportunity.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.399
Back in court,

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.199
I echoed their arguments.

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:01.720
I only wanted
to find a scapegoat for you.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.399
I can bring you into the harem.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.680
I can give you a new identity.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.959
I can make you completely mine.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.040
Sheng Yunlin,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.800
I was the first to fall for you.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.800
I was the one who stayed
by your side all along.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.560
You promised you'd always stay with me.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.439
Why won't you acknowledge me now?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.199
Your Majesty,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.279
Grand Tutor Xie said,

00:07:24.352 --> 00:07:26.399
he wishes to bear all guilt alone,

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:27.520
- not implicating his family.
- Get lost!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.560
Sister.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.720
Sister.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.120
Your thoughts are truly
unfathomable today.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.720
If you insist on persisting in folly,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.399
I refuse to let my husband
suffer this unjust calamity.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.480
I will follow him in death.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:56.040
You'd rather die for that man

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.879
than acknowledge me?

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:03.079
Your Majesty.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.120
If I were her,

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.800
would you have ever pitied me

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.360
for dying once for the Chen State?

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:17.639
If I were not her,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.839
why must you obsess over me,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.120
neglect state affairs,
and become a tyrant?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.439
But I don't want to be sovereign.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.040
I just want you.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.720
Your Majesty is a wise ruler.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.720
Your sister

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.320
is watching over you.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.440
Let this be you

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.360
seeing me off one last time.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.840
His Majesty is critically ill.
The palace is on lockdown.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.559
No one enters without summons.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.639
Seal the palace gates! Now!

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.120
(Yu.)

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.159
Go.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:28.960
Your Majesty,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.600
we've been married for long.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.080
Why does seeing me

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.000
make you so bashful?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.759
Viper.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.200
Viper?

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:57.120
Your Majesty, have you ever considered

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.120
who turned me into what I am today?

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.639
I was also once a noble lady
famed throughout the capital.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.840
In my youth,
I fell for you at first sight.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.879
Do you know

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.960
how overjoyed I was when I learned

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.879
I could marry you?

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.600
Yet on our very wedding night,

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:38.919
to seize control of the Imperial Guard,

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.240
you schemed and murdered my own brother!

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.679
Though I am the Empress,

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.000
all authority

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.039
was handed entirely
to the Grand Princess.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.399
My father used me as a pawn.

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.639
Even you did the same.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:11:59.559
Your Majesty.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:00.919
Your Majesty.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.919
Your Majesty.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.120
In your heart,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.519
was there ever a single moment

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.159
where there was me?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.200
You...

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:19.879
As long as you nod

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:22.120
and say yes,

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:23.639
I can...

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:26.200
I can spare your life.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.480
Nod.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.080
Your Majesty.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.679
Nod.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440
Nod!

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.480
Say yes!

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.480
(Sheng Yunlin,)

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.000
(everything you once possessed,)

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.200
(now belongs to me.)

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.639
(I will stand higher than you ever did,)

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.240
(looking down upon all.)

00:12:58.912 --> 00:12:59.840
Your Highness,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.960
the harem must stay out.

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:04.080
How can you usurp authority?

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:06.279
Much less sit upon the Dragon Throne.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.240
This violates the rules of Chen State.

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:09.879
Indeed.

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.664
When the Grand Princess acted as regent,
it was by His Majesty's decree.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:14.799
Now, you lack

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.200
any legitimate authority!

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.480
My actions today

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.519
are ordained by Heaven.

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:29.879
To voice dissatisfaction

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.600
is to defy Heaven's will.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.200
Heaven's way is clear.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.960
Gentlemen,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.120
be cautious.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.679
- We are at your command.
- We are at your command.

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:47.320
State your business.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.759
Jinxiu.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.039
Jinxiu.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.679
Earlier in the court,

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.360
do I look imposing?

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.799
You have finally reached this point.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.600
I am overjoyed for you.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:04.519
Throughout the land,

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:06.759
no one dares question you anymore.

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:12.559
Come.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:14.279
Come.

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:18.559
Only you...

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.919
Only you truly rejoice
for me from the heart.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.159
Having you by my side

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.279
is truly wonderful.

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.679
Your Highness,

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:33.279
you have treated me so kindly.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:36.120
You have never punished me.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.639
Since following you in my youth,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.679
I've known warm clothes in winter,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.000
and ice in summer cellar storage.

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.759
If there is a next life,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.720
I will still serve you.

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:55.200
Good.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.519
However, these old ministers

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.600
are masters of paying lip service

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:06.679
and standing by idly.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.159
Jinxiu,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.720
go help me keep an eye

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.360
on their families
detained in the palace.

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:17.720
If anyone causes trouble,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600
show no mercy.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.799
Yes.
