[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.740
[Episode 11]

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710
Located near Qingyuan Mountain,
Pingjiang Prefecture

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.970
was plagued by demons.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.680
This time, under imperial orders
to eradicate evil creatures,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.400
all Feiyu Guards worked day and night,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.000
showing absolute devotion.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.590
After several fierce battles,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710
the Feiyu Guard slew over 100 demon beasts

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.200
and multiple great demons.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.229
Among all battles, the one
in the Misty Forest was particularly hard.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.590
Fortunately, by the grace of Your Majesty,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.760
thanks to
Master Bingzhu's excellent command

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
and the soldiers' valiant efforts,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.870
we finally executed the mountain elves
that had blighted the world for a century

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.030
and Jin Muqing, Qionghua's sect leader,
whose soul had corrupted by evil,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.280
right on the spot.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.520
For a long time,
demons inflicted severe harm on Pingjiang.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470
For this combat,
I motivated all individuals in Pingjiang,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.750
including military personnel
and civilians,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.079
to assist Feiyu Guards.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270
I risked my life and possessions

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.150
just to restore peace

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.590
to the people.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.010
What are mountain elves?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.240
Your Majesty,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.610
they're survivors of Hefeng Tribe
from 20 years ago.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520
Hefeng Tribe?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.160
Have you found any leads on Yuli Spring?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.040
Your Majesty,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.170
those dead mountain elves quickly

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.500
decomposed into soil.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.710
To be on the safe side,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.710
I've ordered to have the soil

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.000
that the elves were buried in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.460
all dug up and brought back

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.150
for the Imperial Sorcerer to examine,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.680
in which there may be clues.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.630
Feiyu Guards did a great job
eliminating demons.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.360
Prefect Liu also deserves credit
for providing assistance.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.220
Good! You will all be rewarded
based on your merits.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.440
Thank Your Majesty.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.280
Thank Your Majesty.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.460
The Demon Slayer's presence

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.630
is requested by His Majesty
in the Elixir Refining Chamber.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.750
I also have great news to tell you,
my loyal subject.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.560
A few days ago,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.280
moved by my piety, the Exalted Immortal

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.120
descended to earth again.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.150
This time,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.800
the Exalted Immortal
agreed to accept my offerings.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.600
A hundred intelligent maidens

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.230
shall be sent to Penglang
as attendants of the Exalted Immortal.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.170
Then maybe the celestial mountain barrier
will be removed early.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.920
I've thought it over.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.590
Girls from common families
tend to be coarse.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.020
So I opt for officials' daughters.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.580
This task is now entrusted to you.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.390
I need it done soon.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.720
When the girls are gathered,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.430
have them board a large ship.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.030
You will then personally escort them
to the destination.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.860
But, I think...

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.150
What do you not understand,
my loyal subject?

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.480
As Your Majesty

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.160
commands.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.730
The things here
are even better than those in Pingjiang.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.270
Too bad that I've run out of money,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.600
so I can't buy anything.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.800
After traveling for days,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.240
my face has become as dry as an eggshell.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.040
You wilt in the heat

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.890
when the sun gets high.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.560
So we have to hide during the day
and move at night.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.870
Now, all I want is to feed my stomach.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.070
But I can't conjure money at the moment.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.950
We must find Bingzhu as soon as possible.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.040
Don't worry, miss.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.240
If I were to let
such a beautiful lady like you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.640
struggle on the streets,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.020
wouldn't it be my fault?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.310
I have food and clothes at home.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.340
Why not come home with me, miss?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.450
I don't want to go home with you.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.600
I have an idea.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.950
Why don't you buy

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.120
some life necessities

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.860
for me and my friend right here?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.510
Sure.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.890
Well,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.060
we're looking for a friend.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.830
Do you know where we can find

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.800
the Demon Slayer

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
of the Feiyu Guard?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.950
The Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard?

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.520
Yes.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.610
Why not ask to meet the Emperor too?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.120
You're crazy.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.640
How could you be so rude, sir?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.960
He just insulted us.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.040
When I'm telling the truth,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.970
others actually treat me as a liar.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.600
We were so close

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.480
to persuading

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.290
that man to spend money on us.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.680
Then you would have
had to go home with him.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.810
Silly you. Let's go.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.290
[The Matchmaker's Temple]

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.260
If you're also in love with me,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.390
this knot of true love
will show a response

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.600
once it is tied.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.470
Would you like to try?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.870
Sure.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.200
The knot of true love?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.250
Xiao Yao,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.240
would you like to tie a knot of true love

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.640
to pray for His Lordship?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.040
Xiao Yao,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.070
come here!

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.650
Listen,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.950
these intertwined branches
symbolize a bond for life.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.210
A knot of true love
is best to be tied here.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.480
I hope your heart feels what mine does.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.880
May my love be cherished and returned.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.620
I pray for your safety

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.320
and mine as well.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.170
May all of us be safe

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.390
and well.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.400
I've attached my consciousness
to this vine-wreathed bracelet.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.200
It will keep you safe.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.880
Xiao Yao, look who's here.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.870
God of Marriage, I wish

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.430
-Master Bingzhu will fall in love with me.
-God of Marriage, I hope

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.360
-to become Master Bingzhu's wife soon.
-Please have him propose to me.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.120
Do they look familiar to you?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.600
How can the younger sister get married

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.800
before the older one does?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.830
You were just lusting after
my future husband.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.160
How could I not take action?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160
You have no shame.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.560
-Lord Bingzhu
will only be your brother-in-law!
-But Dad already promised

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.290
to marry me off to Lord Bingzhu.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.550
Not a chance!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.260
Let go!

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.390
Who would've thought
Master Bingzhu could be so popular?

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.560
Let's go find Dad like this then.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.559
Fine, let's do it!

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.360
Since the two of them are here,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.890
the Prefect must be nearby.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.630
If we follow them,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.000
maybe we'll find Bingzhu.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.710
That's right.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.240
Let's go!

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.960
I'll tell my dad!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.390
So will I, as he's my dad too!

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.120
He's my dad!

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.250
-Mine too!
-Ladies!

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.670
You punks!

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.840
Let's go.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.500
Why waste time on these punks?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.820
Ladies,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.100
since you're here
in the Matchmaker's Temple,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.640
I bet you're looking for ideal husbands.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.540
Why not let me

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.790
make your dreams come true?

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.400
Scram!

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.360
She actually told me to scram.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.840
Feisty girls.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.250
Exactly what I like.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.210
It's money.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.240
I once had a bowl of noodles
that was worth several hundred taels.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.900
You think I'd care about this?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.730
Let's go.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.800
We don't want it!

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.690
What's wrong with you?

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.670
Ladies, you're like
precious and beautiful blossoms

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.250
that share a stem,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.510
yet the noble bearing
you exude is not to be ignored.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.810
He even conjured a flower
out of thin air for me.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.930
Does he have any idea what I really am?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.890
What are you waiting for?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.950
-Beat them up!
-How dare you punch me?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.920
Run!

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.600
Are you okay?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.390
Catch them!

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.320
Take them down!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.530
Run!

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.050
Don't let them get away!

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.750
Hands off me!

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.610
Xiao Yao!

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.210
Trying to run away?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.160
I won't let you go anywhere!

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.320
Hold them tight!

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.680
This is the capital,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.240
the most civilized area of the nation.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.600
For harassing common girls,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.000
you deserve punishment.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.860
B-Boss...

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.080
D-do you know who I am?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.220
My dad is the Chief Inspector.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.480
I'm his eldest legitimate son!

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.030
Get lost!

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.790
I...

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.020
If you dare say one more word,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.130
the Demon Slayer will...
My Lord, beat him to death!

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.050
I'll beat you to death!

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.430
Guys, run!

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.820
-I dare you to...
-Go away!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.320
I'll get back at you!

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.950
Lord Bingzhu.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.250
What are you doing in the capital?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.810
We're here for you.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.300
There's a chance for you
to perform a meritorious deed.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.270
But now we're starving

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.390
and exhausted
from the journey to find you.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.050
Well,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.570
do you mind showing some hospitality?

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.150
What do you think? Is it good?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.790
It's amazing!

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.470
Luoluo would definitely love this.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.670
Here, have some more.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.730
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Lord Bingzhu.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.020
What are these?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.600
Candied haws on a stick.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.140
Sweet or sour?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.360
Both!

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.030
Yeah!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.960
This is worth all the trouble
we've been through.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.490
Do demons cultivate so hard

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.900
just to enjoy delicious food
in the human realm?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.120
The human realm
offers so much more than food.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.550
Being human is wonderful.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.030
There's endless joy for humans.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.680
Back then as a flower,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.150
I always envied human women

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.360
whenever I saw them.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.550
They got to wear all sorts of clothes

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.480
and style their hair in various ways.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.180
As they put on different make-up products,

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.930
another kind of beauty
would instantly appear.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.850
While admiring them,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.590
I was cultivating hard.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.220
That made me who I am today.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.390
But my effort's far from enough.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.050
I must continue cultivating.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.020
Therefore,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.480
I'm afraid nobody but you

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.280
and Tan'er can be a match
for Dreamshard Immortal.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.670
Xiao Yao,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.360
you know me well.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.510
That's why you talked about
going to the Realm of Mist and Void

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.960
to eliminate evil spirits.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.290
But I also know you well.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.480
You're full of crafty and wicked ideas.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.960
If you're planning to use me

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.000
to wipe out the Demon King's enemies,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.260
then you're barking up

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.530
the wrong tree.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.390
-Don't you judge me by...
-Come on.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.650
Show him the portrait.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.080
This can prove what our words can't.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.630
Look.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.910
We've all met her on Qingyuan Mountain.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.910
Don't you see I'm telling the truth?

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.390
If I'm lying to you,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.650
may I be penniless
for the rest of my life.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.240
Yeah.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.320
She...

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.330
is in fact a spirit?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.750
Dreamshard Immortal was a divine being

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.270
until she left the celestial mountain

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.240
and was corrupted by worldly desires.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.670
She could no longer
focus on her cultivation

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.070
and thus became a spirit.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.910
She has long fed on the essence
of young women to preserve her appearance,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.150
earning the label
"ruthless and merciless."

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.750
Don't you think you should purge the world
of such an evil spirit?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.240
Where exactly

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.200
is the Realm of Mist and Void?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.240
We don't know.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.480
That's why we came to you.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.790
What is he doing?

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.740
This is the most inclusive nautical chart
in Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.150
All the islands that humans have visited

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.210
are recorded on it.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.870
[Lifeng Island] [Hupo Islet]

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.270
Our target's not here...

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.990
[Penglang]

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.490
This is what humans call
the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:26.870
[Penglang]

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.840
"Penglang."

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.320
Penglang?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.950
Dreamshard Immortal,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.390
emerge now.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.360
Hong Ye.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.670
You're free-spirited

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.770
and unrestrained.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.730
Even a thousand years of hardship

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.360
couldn't tame you.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.990
Yet for my sake,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.680
you've been put through
all the Eight Sufferings of a human life

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.280
and left with a broken heart.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.480
I'm the one who made you this way.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.600
Hong Ye.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.630
This is all my fault.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.200
I have no regrets.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.240
Hong Ye.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.300
Never has a moment gone by

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.480
without me feeling miserable.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.240
Give me a chance to atone for my sins.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.360
Let's start over,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.870
shall we?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.349
Hong Ye.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.510
Look at me.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.480
I am Xiao Yao.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.660
Ning'an betrayed you,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.400
but I won't.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.480
You could forsake

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.480
your life for Ning'an.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.740
Then what about me?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.570
Will you do anything

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.550
for me?

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.310
Yes, I will.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.310
Very well.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.400
You're voluntarily giving me your heart.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.840
A human feels no pain without a heart.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.960
So does a demon.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.630
This is right.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.160
It's her.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.110
Exactly her.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.460
It's like you can read my mind,
my loyal subject.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.440
She's the Exalted Immortal
I told you about.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.550
This painting captures her perfectly.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.800
Your Majesty,

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.680
when I reviewed the Feiyu Guard's
secret archives yesterday,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.000
I learned about the existence
of certain spirits

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.750
that specialize in bewitching people

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.680
and feed on the essence of maidens.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.310
This, in my opinion, is a serious issue.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.200
I propose to verify the identity
of the Exalted Immortal before sending

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.060
girls to the celestial mountain.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.920
Are you indicating...

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.200
that I'm a foolish and incompetent ruler

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.130
who has been bewitched by a spirit?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.290
I don't mean any of that.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.050
I'm only imploring Your Majesty to wait

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.380
till I figure out the truth about spirits.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.310
Wait?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.970
Till your investigation's over
or till I die?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.880
My apologies!

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.510
Your Majesty shall live for ever and ever!

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.960
Quickly gather 100 maidens.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.960
Set sail soon.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.030
No delay is allowed.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.370
As Your Majesty

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.790
commands.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.050
Tan'er, you want to go too?

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.270
This trip is to the lair of evil spirits.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.880
Extreme danger lies ahead,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.780
yet I cannot mobilize any troops.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.280
What if we...

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.730
Are you really this eager
to help Xiao Yao?

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.630
Demon Slayer,

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.680
the Feiyu Guard has assembled.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.550
[Tianwei Gate]

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.810
The Feiyu Guard is ordered by His Majesty

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.610
to bring the daughters

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.070
of officials of sixth rank and above,

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.400
who, under the age of 18,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.270
must be of good character and appearance,

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.700
out of the city gate at 3 p.m.,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.270
so as to ship them to serve
the Exalted Immortal.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.270
Do arrive on time!

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.070
Yes!

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.030
[Li Residence]

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.310
We the Feiyu Guards are acting
on imperial orders.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.160
Those who dare to disobey

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.480
will be punished
for defiance of the Emperor's will.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.200
Let go of me!

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.510
My daughter!

Hands off her!

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.880
Take the girl away!

Move!

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.270
Let go of me!

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.000
Keep moving!

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.060
Let go of me!

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.830
Dad!

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.110
Mom!

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.550
Dad!

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.030
Dad!

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.050
What's the use of being an official?

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.380
You can't even protect your own daughter!

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.750
Ease up a little!

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.240
What's the matter with you?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.300
Bear with me, miss.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.630
[Residence of Demon Slayer]

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.920
Xiao Yao, Dali.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.680
It's quite a distance
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.110
I believe you need to buy supplies

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.710
for unexpected situations.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.980
Have you figured out how to get there?

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.340
Not yet.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.920
But once we're at sea,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.160
Dreamshard will surely come to guide us.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.290
Just take the money.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680
Alright, thanks.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.920
The sun's intense out at sea.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.240
We'll need plenty of makeup products
and spare clothes.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.640
Right.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.270
Let me smell it again.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.630
-What a lovely scent.
-How fragrant.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.950
You like that too?

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.170
When we return,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.700
I'll get you a new sheath.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.630
Tan'er, this is for you.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.370
We didn't get to draw a fortune stick
last time at the Matchmaker's Temple.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.240
Why don't we...

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.510
Draw a fortune stick?

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.000
Yes.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:55.640
Yes.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.420
Let's go.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.400
[God of Marriage]

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.920
There are so many people here.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.680
I bet today is an auspicious day.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.160
I agree.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.110
Let's hang ours over there.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.750
Sure.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.600
I'll go draw a fortune stick.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.640
An auspicious omen?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.400
No way. I'll try again.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.730
That one doesn't count.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.500
Let me check it out.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.920
"Thrivingly the golden bough
and jade leave grow."

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.580
"No wind, frost, rain, or snow
can lay them low."

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.030
What an auspicious lot.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.270
It's a stroke of supreme luck, Dali.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.530
Terrific!

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.420
[Supreme Luck]

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.440
So you're able to interpret
fortune sticks, My Lord.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.290
Xiao Yao, I drew a highly auspicious lot.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.820
You should draw a stick too.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.400
-Fancy a try?
-I got the best of fortune.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.860
I want a new one.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.160
Please explain the note to me, My Lord.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.420
"A perfect union was forged
at the dawn of time."

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.870
"The timing is good,
and all things in bliss are laid."

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.330
"Do not ignore this message,
lucky fellow."

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.630
"You will be blessed with joy
and many children."

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.110
This...

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.510
This is the best of all sticks
marked with "Supreme Luck"!

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.000
[Supreme Luck]

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.440
Xiao Yao,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.120
you're in great luck!

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.380
That's wonderful!

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.310
Thank you for the kind words, My Lord.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.310
There's fresh water in the room for you.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.590
Freshen up and get changed.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.480
I'll be waiting outside.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:38.880
Got it.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.400
Yes.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.480
He's actually nice.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.640
Why are you locking the door?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.590
Let me out!

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.110
Stay away from the door.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.160
Let me out!

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.750
What happened?

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.280
Bingzhu, what are you up to?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.510
Xiao Yao, don't worry.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.070
I will go to the Realm of Mist and Void

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.670
to destroy that devil spirit
with my own hands.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160
Dreamshard is cunning and deceitful.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.820
This trip could be a tough one.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.720
Your involvement will only serve

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.250
to increase the burden on me

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.840
without offering any help.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.110
It's better for you to wait here,

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.430
so you won't lose your lives for nothing.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.690
How long do we have to stay here?

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.570
The charm will lose effect in 10 days.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.720
The food and water inside

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.920
will last you 10 days.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.460
If I can't make it back,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.280
don't bother to go there.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.970
Focus on your cultivation,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.920
and don't harm people.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.170
Lord Bingzhu,
come back to talk it through!

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.880
No wonder he prepared so much food for us.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.000
It turns out
he planned to confine us here.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.260
What's there to do?
We must find a way out.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.680
Or there won't be sunshine

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.720
for me in the next 10 days!

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.520
What can we do?

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.850
It's 10 whole days. His Lordship will...

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.760
Xiao Yao, what are you doing?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.310
No harm can be caused
when our hands are away from the charm.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.040
Good thing I was well prepared.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.940
Seems like you braced yourself for this.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.110
How did you know he wouldn't let us go?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.640
Demons are behind
every unusual occurrence.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.070
He...

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.670
Aren't we demons ourselves?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.080
He suddenly spent so much money on us

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.010
and rigged the fortune sticks
with lame tricks.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.350
Lord Bingzhu's ways

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.780
of pleasing girls are so corny.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.320
I must teach him a thing or two
next time I see him.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.680
How are you so clever?

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.030
It would take me more than a lifetime
to realize that.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.560
I was thinking... What now?

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.980
Let's go.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.980
Wait.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.430
I'll take all that stuff with me.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.230
I've decided to spend his money.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.110
I'll take everything he bought us.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.400
Bingzhu is not very nice,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.110
but the things he bought are quite nice.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.350
Don't take too many things!

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.750
-Get in there!
-No!

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.640
Go in!

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.030
Sir!

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.750
I hear you! Just a moment!

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.750
I'm stuck, Dad.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.510
Congratulations, sir.
Two wonderful things have happened to you.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.750
Right after receiving a decree
for a promotion,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.880
your daughters are now given

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.270
the honor of serving the Exalted Immortal.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.000
How very delightful.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.030
Officer, my two daughters

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.030
love to play.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.460
They're still away, hanging out in town.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.030
In that case,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.890
please let my men search the room,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.510
so we can complete our task.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.270
Officer, my two daughters

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.350
are rather vulgar.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.070
They're not suited to be attendants
for the Exalted Immortal.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.000
Dad!

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.980
Mom!

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.030
We're back!

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.640
Dad,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.550
why didn't you tell me

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.480
and my sister such wonderful news?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.830
We heard about it.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.640
By imperial decree,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.200
we have the privilege
to serve an immortal in Penglang.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.440
That's right. Sis,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.510
we'd better hurry.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.110
It's said that only 100 girls are needed.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.920
If we arrive too late,

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.440
this golden opportunity will slip by.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.030
Right?

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.160
Right, sis.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.590
Yeah.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.160
Dad.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.880
Mom.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.790
Don't worry,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.070
We will surely

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.200
bring honor to you!

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.000
Officer,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.070
please wait a moment.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.110
We'll go with you after getting changed.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.000
Wait for us!

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.310
Don't go anywhere!

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.660
Hurry!

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.590
Sir, unlike what you said,
your daughters are actually

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.270
more fun than vulgar.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.160
Goodbye.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.880
My love.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:39.960
Come on.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.790
Punch me.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.180
So this is not a dream.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.720
It really is not a dream!

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.980
It isn't, Master!

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.480
Oh no!

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.230
Sweetheart!

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:54.960
Sweetheart.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.240
Sweetheart!

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.370
You're safe now.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.310
All is fine.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.030
My dear daughter.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.550
Mom!

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.310
I got my belly stuck.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.640
I know, I know.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.880
It's alright now.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.440
What is this about?

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.810
Why bring us here?

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.380
What did we do to deserve this?

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.030
Everyone, please don't worry.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.090
By imperial order,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.480
you'll embark on a journey to Penglang

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.210
to serve the Exalted Immortal.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.770
This is a great opportunity

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.120
and a tremendous honor.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.050
Should your fathers

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.110
and brothers are officials, they'll be

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.040
promoted and conferred nobility.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.640
Really?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.590
Now,

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.030
I hope you can trust me.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.720
I will personally escort you all
to the celestial mountain

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.380
and ensure your safety
throughout the journey.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720
Is everyone here?

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.170
My Lord, we're short of two girls.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.110
My Lord, I'm sorry

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.030
for being late.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.450
This way.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.400
Move over.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.910
He spotted us.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.830
Demon Slayer,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.490
it's already 3 p.m.
All the girls are here.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.590
Then set off.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:17.750
Yes.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.560
Stop crying!

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.840
Get onboard!

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.510
Keep up!

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.520
Commander Ji,

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.880
disembark with your people
when the girls settle in.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.280
No need to travel with us.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.160
We will pray for you in the capital,
My Lord.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.790
May I ask, My Lord,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.680
what direction should the ship head in?

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.310
Toward the open sea!

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.480
Pardon me, My Lord.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.830
The sea is unpredictable.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.290
I can't steer properly

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.640
without specific instructions.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.400
Don't worry.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.600
When we're out at sea,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.530
someone will point out a direction for us.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.310
Yes!

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.790
Exalted Immortal,
we're ready to serve you wholeheartedly.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.240
Please point us in the right direction!

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.510
Exalted Immortal,
we're ready to serve you wholeheartedly.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.750
Please point us in the right direction!

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.750
Exalted Immortal,
we're ready to serve you wholeheartedly.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.920
Please point us in the right direction!

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.500
Dreamshard Immortal,

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.030
you summoned us here!

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.270
Dreamshard Immortal,

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.570
it was you who summoned us here!

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.680
Dreamshard Immortal,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.160
it was you who summoned us here!

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:17.030
Please point us in the right direction!

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.230
Exalted Immortal,
we're ready to serve you wholeheartedly.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.500
Please point us in the right direction!

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.240
The sun's out!

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.790
Exalted Immortal,
we're ready to serve you wholeheartedly.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.270
Please point us in the right direction!

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.070
Celestial mountain.
That's the celestial mountain!

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.880
Xiao Yao,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.510
look!

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.160
The Exalted Immortal
has exerted her power!

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.270
We survived!

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.710
Will we meet the Exalted Immortal soon?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.240
Xiao Yao, let's go check it out too.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.220
Look at that!

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.270
It's real!

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.060
We're saved!

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.400
We're saved!

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.270
Stay calm.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.310
Be composed.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.790
Calm down.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.880
I thought we were doomed,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.590
but we surprisingly survived
and are now even looking

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.000
at the celestial mountain!

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.920
Indeed.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.270
The celestial mountain
is said to be extremely difficult to find.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.030
We're truly blessed
by the Exalted Immortal!

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.070
Does it mean we can drink

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.960
from Yuli Spring in the celestial mountain

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.220
and gain immortality?

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.070
Immortality?

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.400
Look, it's right there!

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.680
You'll find yourselves

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.510
in a perilous location upon disembarking.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.350
Remember to always stay cautious

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.480
and ward off danger.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.600
Hong Ye,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.960
I'll see you soon.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.680
What a spectacle!

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.590
Is this the immortal realm?

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.150
Am I in a dream or what?

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.070
We must be close to Yuli Spring,

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.830
now that we've reached the immortal realm.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.430
I've never seen
these many beautiful flowers.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.540
Such a lovely place.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.280
Stay in order.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.550
Everyone, stay in order.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.610
Mind your manners.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.310
You're just a mere Demon Slayer.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.850
What rank do you hold?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.810
You already bossed us around on the ship,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.760
and now you're still brazenly bullying us.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.230
Someone's here to receive us!

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.150
Fairies!

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.790
They're fairies!

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.010
Here they come!

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.159
Fairies have descended!

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.230
Miss, you're stunning.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.080
Ms. Fairy!

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.530
Ms. Fairy!

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.920
Everyone, welcome

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.830
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.560
The Realm of Mist and Void?

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.400
Aren't we in Penglang?

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.400
That's what humans call this place.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.650
This island

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.370
lies between the human realm
and the immortal realm.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.030
For divine beings, this place is called
the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.450
Since this is the immortal realm,

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.450
you must all be fairies, aren't you?

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.630
We are disciples of the Exalted Immortal.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.370
If fate has it that you stay,

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.430
you will become sisters with us.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.030
We might get to stay!

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.960
We could be fairies too!

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.280
I may become a fairy!

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.840
I am Bingzhu,
the Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.100
of Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.480
By order of His Majesty,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.670
I've brought 100 Tiansheng maidens
to serve

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.930
the Exalted Immortal.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.120
Leave the girls to us.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.980
You may go now.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.120
Assigned by the Emperor to this task,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.190
I must see the Exalted Immortal in person,

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.630
or I will have no report
to deliver to His Majesty.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.150
The Realm of Mist and Void
is a paradise for women.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.480
Filthy mortal men are never allowed

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.940
to set foot on this island.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.960
Your very presence in this sea of flowers

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.110
is already an exception.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.310
The Exalted Immortal has her own rules.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.410
As an official,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.550
I have duties to fulfill as well.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.590
These 100 maidens

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.680
were carefully selected
from Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.110
It is my duty

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.710
to protect them

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.370
and to hand over each and every

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.440
one of them to the Exalted Immortal.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.710
So...

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.800
you insist on meeting
the Exalted Immortal?

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.000
I'm only doing my job.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.160
You have to know
the Realm of Mist and Void

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.710
has never been trodden by a human male.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.890
If you persist in being the first one
to do so,

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.400
then I'm afraid

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.330
you'll also be the last one.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.220
As long as I get to complete the mission

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.640
given by His Majesty,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.080
I don't mind losing my life.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.700
In that case,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.800
come with us, Demon Slayer.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:58.670
Let's go.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.660
Be quick. Move along.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.860
-Let's go.
-Come on.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.310
Let's follow them.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.230
Keep up!

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.670
This is great!

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.520
We're about to meet the Exalted Immortal!

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.280
Wait for me!

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.710
Come here. Hurry!

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.950
Get a move on.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.840
Madam,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.010
what kind of flowers are you growing?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.510
These aren't flowers,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.030
but human hearts.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.860
These flowers bloom

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.630
only to wither.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.160
They fall off

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.560
for the fruit to set.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.810
Then many, many human hearts
will be produced.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.600
The Exalted Immortal

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.190
loves them most.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.960
Ladies, the three of you

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.990
are breathtakingly beautiful.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.210
I've never seen anyone

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.340
as pretty as you are in the human realm.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.150
Then try picking

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.080
the most gorgeous one out of us.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.650
You are each beautiful in your own way.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.990
Well, how am I supposed to make a pick?

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.910
But you have to.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.320
You will be rewarded

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.740
if you do a good job at it.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.710
That said,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.650
the lady in front is wearing a veil.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.000
We can't see her face.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.740
Then just go ahead

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.130
and ask her to remove the veil

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.390
so you can see her face.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.150
Miss!

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.570
Back there, we were just talking about

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.770
how captivating

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.030
your eyes are.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.920
We're curious about the beauty

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.980
beneath your veil.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.840
Yeah, Ms. Fairy.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.920
Please, show us your face.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.380
We'd love to see your face!

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.190
Don't wander off.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.700
Lu Pianpian,

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.800
they've been chattering all the way

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.130
about your appearance.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.650
It's getting on my nerves.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.290
Just show them your face.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.450
Please let us see your face.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:49.660
Ms. Fairy!

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.840
One glimpse is fine.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.100
Pianpian, your beauty is unparalleled.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.880
Why not let these human girls
see for themselves?

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.680
That's right!

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.160
Please show us your face, Ms. Fairy!

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.840
Let us see your face, miss!

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.310
Please!

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.610
Why is there such a big scar?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.130
How could this be?

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.110
Girls, are you

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.800
satisfied now?

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.250
I willingly accepted punishment

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.520
for making a mistake.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.880
Out of mercy, the Exalted Immortal

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.630
only left this mark on my face

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.840
as a warning.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.710
If you're lucky to stay,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.320
learn from my experience

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.740
and don't make the same mistake.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.850
She who does wrong
gets a scar on the face?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.360
How terrifying.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.680
This fairy here is beautiful
beyond compare.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.470
Pretty or ugly—

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.480
it's only a matter of perspective.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.110
Though your appearance is damaged,

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.460
your dignity remains intact.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.410
That is unassailable.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.790
I didn't expect Bingzhu
to be such a smooth talker.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.450
I'll never believe him again.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.710
You've seen my face already.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.530
Let's keep walking.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.170
Let's go. Hurry.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.840
Everyone,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.770
we have to stop here.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.030
The Exalted Immortal never recruits
those without celestial potential.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.880
Please stay here and take a rest.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.550
Only those who pass
the trial of the Realm of Mist and Void

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:42.820
and show outstanding talent

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.190
can reside permanently.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.340
Trial?

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.410
There's a trial?

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.150
We're all holy maidens
chosen by Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.280
Before coming here,

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.630
we went through
a rigorous selection process.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.760
That's right!

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.290
Exactly.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.550
The selection in the human realm
differs from that in the immortal realm.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.750
The trial consists of multiple rounds.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.000
When will we get to
drink from Yuli Spring?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.550
Yeah.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.840
Anyone not willing to follow
the rules of the Realm of Mist and Void

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.070
may exit now.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.840
I can see that none of your want to leave.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.880
Ying Ning, Pei,

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.950
bring them to their abodes.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.630
Hold on.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.420
These young ladies

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.400
are seen as precious treasures
in Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.800
Miss, I hope to be informed in advance
if there will be danger

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.280
in the trial
of the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.390
Demon Slayer,

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.480
are you suggesting

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.140
you'd like to take the trial for them?

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.390
It's up to the maidens

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.380
to decide
whether to take the trial or not.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.230
I just have to make sure

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.220
that each and every one of them

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.160
remains completely unscathed.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.520
They will, of course.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.420
What's wrong? Did she spot us?

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.070
The two of you,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.480
come here.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.240
Who?

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.280
Those two girls at the back,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.760
turn around.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.860
We're done for.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.240
She meant those two.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.700
Here we meet again.
