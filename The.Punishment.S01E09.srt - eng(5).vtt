Why are you two here?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.460
Just came to see how you're doing.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.670
You seem to be

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.120
doing well here.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.070
You look good.
Have you gained some weight?

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.530
-Yes, he has.
-Don't talk nonsense.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.070
You two are the ones who've gained weight.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.800
That's impossible.
We're busy as hell every day.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.560
solved a major case

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.720
and got promoted.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.600
Really?

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.650

Senior Hongchao.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.520
Xiaoyue.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.710
Congratulations.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
I learned a great deal from you both.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.600
You were always cut out for this.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.070
We just showed you the way.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.620
Don't be so modest. Congratulations.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.850
Thank you, Senior Hongchao.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220
I'm waiting for you to get out soon.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.750
Okay.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.600
Let's not talk about me.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660
Is there any progress on Xu Li's case?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090
Is there any progress on Xu Li's case?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.570
It's still under investigation.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.880
Who's investigating it?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.840
Mentor?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.150
Mentor...

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.020
Mentor has been transferred
to the Provincial Bureau.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.490
Then how is he supposed to investigate?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.890
We're investigating it.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.789
Weren't you transferred to the
police station? How are you investigating?

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.430
Don't worry about these things.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.140
How are you doing in here?
Do you need anything?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.760
We both just topped up your card for you.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.160
-Let me know if you need anything.
-Don't change the subject.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.850
Mentor isn't investigating it anymore,
is he?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.890
He has other work
at the provincial bureau now.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.289
He's not investigating it anymore, right?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.759
Alright, I got it.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.220

Look,

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.710
he's getting worked up again.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.509

I've never even dreamed of this much gold.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.560
How much money is this worth?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.420
It must be worth

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.610
several million at least.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.280
No.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.579
At least tens of millions.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.340
It's so much money.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.790

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.870
Well...

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.210
This money wasn't honestly earned anyway.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.120
If we don't take it, it's a waste, right?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.650
Besides.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.800
Taking this money

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.820
discuss this matter properly?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.270
What's there to discuss?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.870

What would it mean if we took this?

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.650
This is breaking the law.

If we don't take it,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.210

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.480

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.010
I'm so happy today.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.080
I'm so happy today.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.270
I'm so happy today.

Tucked right into my pocket.

Taoyi,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.830
would you dare to answer if I called you?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.909
I'm exhausted.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.360
We'll give him a clean sweep today.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.690
You have five minutes.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.260
I'll wait for you here.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.870
Push harder.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.680
Why hasn't Tianye
finished packaging yet?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.360
No idea.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.560
This thing is so heavy.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.160
Hurry up. It's getting late.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.510
Push!

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240
Come on, push!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.220
Stop laughing. Give me a hand.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.360
You two are something else.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.420
Is everything packed?

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.430
This is the last box.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.120
It's all here.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.070
Don't rest now.
Let's finish this and go.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.870
Let's go.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.980
What's wrong with you three?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.700
Why the long faces?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.810
Listen,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.300
what are we going to do
with all this stuff?

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.510
How about

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.360
we find a place

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.890
and bury it all?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.550
Bury it? Are you kidding?

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.860
We should spend it.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.400
This much gold would be a problem
to bury anywhere.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.920
Besides,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.100
once we have money,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.160
who would we fear?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.710
That Ma Jin—

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.840
He's nothing compared to real gold.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.240
Easy for you to say.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.760
With this much gold,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.320
who do we trade it with?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.050
Who can do it?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.160
And who would dare?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.680
I can ask around about that.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.780
I know some

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.930
pawnshop owners

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.570
who love to trade for gold.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.840
Maybe,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.300
they'll agree
if we do it in multiple trades.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.670
If you really have connections,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.930
let's trade it all at once

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.880
and buy trucks,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.200
then our logistics business
will be up and running.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.870
No way.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.750
Nobody can use this money right now.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.320
Why?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.720
Look, with the money gone,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.360
Ma Jin must be searching everywhere
for it.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.790
If we use this gold now,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.740
it's like announcing to everyone
that we took the money.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.120
What's wrong with you, Tianye?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.550
When we had no money before,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.750
you weren't afraid of anything.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.430
Now the gold is right in front of us.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.390
We just need to keep a low profile.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.550
No one will know.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.000
Even if someone finds out,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.870
we'll just say we won the lottery.
What's wrong with that?

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.440
No, this is different.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.030
Can you use your brain for once?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.750
Jiangyong was right.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.600
We used to be carefree

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.130
and were afraid of nothing.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.610
Now it's different.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.010
We need to think about the future.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.980
Anyway, I think

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.080
as long as Ma Jin remains in power,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.540
nobody can use this money.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.410
What if he never falls from power?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.170
Are we supposed
to hold onto this money forever?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.960
He must fall.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.940
I don't want Feng to know about this.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.470
Have you thought about it?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.260
Ma Jin won't let us off.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:24.770
I know.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.930
But I don't want
to live like this forever.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.610
When opportunity comes, you must seize it.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.650
I've been waiting all these years.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.530
If I can just seize this opportunity,
I can...

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.920
we can

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.710
break free from here.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.200
With Zhao Peng here earlier,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.670
I couldn't speak freely.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.250
Now, it's just the two of us.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.920
I need to tell you something.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.050
Everyone trusts you so much.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.440
Don't let your own ambition

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.440
get everyone hurt.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.840
Now you've
dragged Zhao Peng into this, too.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.240
Tianye,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.270
what you're doing is dangerous.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.480
No, Zhao Peng isn't involved in this part.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.720
If we don't cooperate with Zhao Village,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.120
we're no match for Ma Jin.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.370
Besides, Zhao Peng is our ally now.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.480
If Ma Jin can do it,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.670
why can't we?

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.630
You're right.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.180
Fine.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.180
You have your own reasons.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.210
Actually, as your big bro,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.150
I'm not very good at it.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.990
No.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.050
I am.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.410
Look, when it comes to brains,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.700
I'm not as smart as you.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.720
In terms of courage,
I'm not as brave as Tianfei.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.250
Other than brute strength,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.760
I don't really have any skills.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.590
Tianye,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.200
from now on,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.750
you make the decisions

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.010
on how to handle things

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.870
and which path to take.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.270
I just hope

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.270
that you can

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.450
use the money properly.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.680
And lead our Longwan to a better future.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.870
I heard

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.550
you already knew Ziyi before.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.750
We went to the same school.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.280
She was a few years after me.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.720
She was even the campus beauty queen.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.510
I've heard her mention you, too.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.030
She spoke quite highly of you.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.720
Really?

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.670
I spent all last night thinking.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.620
Even though we are now partners,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.200
I still feel like

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.090
there's something between us.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.080
What do you mean?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.240
I can't quite put my finger on it.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.040
But it still feels a bit distant.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.150
How old are you this year?

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.960
I'm 33 years old.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.580
Are you seeing anyone?

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.480
Not yet.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.670
You should be dating at your age.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.970
Well, my mom hasn't been pushing me yet.

we're in the same boat now,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.800
but this...

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.270
Business is business.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.670
You can't pressure people
when it comes to relationships.

you two would be a good match.

he's a friend of Tao.

your profession is very sensitive.

I'm just worried

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.140
Tao might lose his head

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.200
and do

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.460
something stupid.

OK. Go back to work.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.280
Don't stress yourself too much.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.610

Alright.

What are you doing?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.570
It's not polite to visit during mealtime.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.790
I'll join you and bring some extra food.

Here.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.350
It's that cooked food.

You can just heat it up and eat it.

You're a real stand-up guy.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.920
You stick it up here.
Are you studying his face?

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.120
Can studying his face
help you find him?

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.590
Sometimes when I look in the mirror,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.020
I feel like I am him.

Stop making excuses for him.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880
He hasn't done anything
he's supposed to do.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.920
Don't mention him; it annoys me.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.590
Fine.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.320
If you don't want to hear it,
I won't talk about it.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.630
What do you come to see me for?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.310
Nothing special.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.570
I just came back from the hospital.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.310
Wang Tao's mom

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.160
is not doing well.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.240
You should
report Tao's situation right away.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.790
Doesn't the bureau help
whenever it can?

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.160
They can only help
if there's something they can do.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.130
The problem is
that there's no kidney donor available.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.530
Does the bureau have one?

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.290
But the current situation at the bureau...

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.140
I don't even want to talk about it.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:41.830
What's wrong?

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.680
Did something happen?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.480
No.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.210
I won't speak without evidence.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240
Do you remember

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.880
when we first met?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.080
You were just a teenager.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.440
All you wanted was to avenge your parents.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.010
I kept holding you back,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.670
and you wouldn't listen.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.600
Remember?

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.160
I was just a kid then. What did I know?

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.270
You know, sometimes

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.940
people are just like that.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.410
When you're young,

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.180
you just do whatever you want.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.070
Then as you grow older,

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.890
you think more and more.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.630
And when you overthink,

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.930
you get scared.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.680
Once you're scared,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.400
things get complicated,

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.070
and you don't dare to act.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.490
But it really doesn't have to be
that complicated.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.620
Just do it.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.950
You really are experienced.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.030
You understand things
much better than I do.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.880
Of course.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.570
I've been through so much.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.560
I figured it out long ago.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.360
Just eat, young man.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.210
After you've had your fill,

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.870
go back to work at the bureau.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.960
Wang Tao,

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.680
who told you to come back?

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.030
Doesn't your mom need you at the hospital?

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.160
Why do you go back here?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.920
My wife is taking care of my mom
over there.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.110
I know you're concerned about the case,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.480
so I came back in case you needed help.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.310
Aren't you ashamed?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.040
Your wife is there all the time.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.920
What's wrong with staying there a while?

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.590
We're not short-staffed here.
Why do you come back?

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.270
Why don't you need more people?

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.720
You're the gas, and I'm the brake—
and now you're running without me.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.790
What if you get into an accident?

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:33.270
I'll kick you.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.440
What accident?
I'm doing just fine.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.160
Alright, don't worry about my mom.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.240
My wife is keeping an eye on it.
It's fine.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.970
Captain Qin.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.750
The autopsy report is ready.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.210
Cause of death: stabbing.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.750
Any news about the killer?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.460
No.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.240
The area under the bridge
wasn't the primary crime scene.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.680
And the surveillance footage nearby

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.510
only captured Qian Yuhong's car.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.040
The residents nearby
didn't notice anything unusual, either.

Expand the search area.

Yes, sir.

Keep a close eye on Song Hao.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.210
Yes, sir.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.590
It's over?

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.920
I lost again?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.620
So that's how you use the rook.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.110
When it comes to Chinese Chess,
you're still the master.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.040
I couldn't even think of that move.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.310
One wrong move leads to total failure.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.360
Even ten brilliant moves

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840
can't save it.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.800
That's right.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:33.710
How about this?

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.370
I'll play another round with you.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.900
I'll play it safe this time.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.310
If you lose a game,

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.290
you can start over.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.960
But if you lose your life,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.420
there's no second chance.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.429
What do you mean, Dad?

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.250
You don't say anything,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.730
but do you think I know nothing?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.920
Why didn't you tell me first

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.250
when trouble broke out?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.400
Dad.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.910
Mr. Ma was the one
who arranged everything.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.320
I was just helping out.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.100
But something unexpected happened.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.160
But Mr. Ma said

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.150
this matter was handled very cleanly.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.320
Have you seen

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.670
the movie "Titanic"?

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.710
Yes.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.600
When the ship is sailing,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.820
everyone sings and dances together.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.440
When it sinks,
everyone jumps into the sea together.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.070
Wrong.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.690
The ship has already sunk.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.880
You need to jump into the sea.

I know I was wrong.

For the sake of Yi and my daughter,

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.510
please give me another chance.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.170
When you did all these things,

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.550
did you ever think about them?

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.880
I know I've let Yi down,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880
let my daughter down,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880
and let you down.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.480
I've wanted to tell you for a long time,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.880
but I was afraid you'd worry.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.070
But I swear to you, Dad,

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.530
there's nothing
between Qian Yuhong and me.

What's all that noise?

Nothing.

Just for decoration?

Sir,

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:38.920
since our neighborhood

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.440
hasn't officially opened yet,

aren't connected to the system.

And wasn't there a security guard

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.320
on duty at the main gate?

Sir,

as you can see,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.440
we rarely get visitors here.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.800
We haven't even hired
all the security staff yet.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.530
We really didn't see anything.

Hello.

Who called the police?

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.770
Officer, I called the police.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.350
This gentleman said he lost something.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.070
Sir,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.780
please explain it
to the officers yourself.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360
What did you lose?

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.920
I didn't lose anything.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.320
If nothing's missing,
why call the police?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.230
I wasn't the one who called.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.030
Wait a moment.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.880

you finally returned my call.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.200
Why are you calling so late?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.480
Something happened.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.630
Something terrible happened.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.080
The money is gone!

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.760
Ma Jin's money and gold bars are all gone!

Keep your voice down.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.040
What exactly happened?

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.480
When I came back,
the door had been pried open.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.300
I have no idea who took it.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:21.600
Sir,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.840
you're a police officer.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.000
You can definitely help me
find the person, right?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.130
If your money's gone, go talk to Ma Jin.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.120
Don't bother me.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.030

Any news from Song Hao?

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.840
Nothing special. Just his normal routine.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.390
He's keeping his cool.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.200
Oh right,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.630
he called the police yesterday

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.590
and reported something was missing.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.590
What was missing?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.500
I don't know. He didn't say it.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:16.840
Where?

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.200
Guanlan Residence.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.290
Something was missing?

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.990
The lock was forced open.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.700
This guy smoked a lot.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.390
This looks like a secret door.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.820

Guanlan Residence

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.740
So, this is a secret vault.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.070
So Song Hao lost the gold bars
and was afraid to tell Ma Jin.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.960
And he called the police
to find out who stole them.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.420
This guy is quite cunning.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.330
That's probably how it works.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.580
Let's go

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.150

your relationship with Qian Yuhong.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.880
There's nothing between us.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.430
We just met a few times

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.480
and had some meals together,

The last time?

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.920
It was too long ago to remember.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:59.710
We weren't close,

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.790
so we rarely met.
