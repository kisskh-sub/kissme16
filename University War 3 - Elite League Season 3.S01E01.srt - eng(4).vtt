Hey, this is pretty impressive.

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.314
"KAIST."

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.233
Our logo looks slick.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.151
"KAIST."

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.114
TEAM KAIST

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.782
I'm glad I'm here.

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.494
This should be fun.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.789
Hello, I got priority admission
to the Korea Science Academy of KAIST.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.374
I've dedicated my life
to KAIST since then.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:25.586
I'm Jeon Ji-min,
a KAIST-Samsung Scholarship recipient

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.671
and a Semiconductor System Engineering
major since 2022.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.924
My mother is a board game instructor.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.219
So I've entered many competitions
thanks to her.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:37.055
I swept the board every time I competed.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:40.475
So one time, the organizers asked me
to stop signing up.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:41.685
Let's do our best.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.062
Our clips will be on the web
for at least a decade.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.481
Hello.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.026
TEAM POSTECH

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.611
Hello.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.615
Wow, it's so spacious here.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.241
It looks much bigger in person.

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:57.534
- The set?
- Yeah.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.454
- You're polishing your tone too much.
- You think so?

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:01.747
It's not exactly that.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.207
- I'm just really nervous.
- Just nervous? Okay.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.376
- Don't get intimidated.
- Okay.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.421
You've once ranked number one
in all of Korea.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.632
- Briefly.
- Top among all high schoolers.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:15.010
I hold the record of publishing
the most articles as a high schooler.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.887
I placed first in math
at Daejeon Science High.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.472
My name is Hwang Seok-hun,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.891
a recipient
of the Presidential Science Scholarship

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.476
and a Math major at POSTECH since 2024.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.144
Don't be intimidated.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.021
I'M NOT INTIMIDATED

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.489
TEAM YONSEI

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:37.991
Isn't that Park Sang-yeon?

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:41.286
Isn't that Park Sang-yeon
from The Devil's Plan Season 2?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.872
Hello, I was the top student
at Seoul Science High,

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.999
a gold medalist
in the International Physics Olympiad,

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.793
and a contestant
in The Devil's Plan Season 2.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.671
I'm Park Sang-yeon, attending
Yonsei's College of Medicine since 2022.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:54.132
I have so many regrets
about my performance on The Devil's Plan.

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.426
Because most contestants
were older than me,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.514
it was difficult to push through
the strategies that I wanted.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.517
On the other hand,
Elite League is a brainpower challenge

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.353
between college students
who are similar in age.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.065
I promise to show you my team
crushing our competitors.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.942
Our team is bound to be the best.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.111
- We have you on our team.
- Exactly.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.821
You have me on your side.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.240
Did he do well on The Devil's Plan?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:21.952
On The Devil's Plan,
he got eliminated pretty quickly.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.996
- Who are we talking about?
- Park Sang-yeon.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.081
Sang-yeon?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.669
That piqued my interest.
I wanted to go up against him.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:34.589
Did they go for the black-and-white theme
to set us up based on our fields?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:38.051
Hey, maybe it's
STEM versus medical schools.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.803
MEDICAL VS STEM

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.346
- That sounds likely.
- Right?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.597
That's a solid theory.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.558
This season must be all about

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.935
pitting medical students
against STEM students.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.605
- That means we could team up with KAIST.
- That's going to be painful.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.651
Let's do our best.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.697
Isn't white usually
the better player in Go?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.074
- Well, it's the color of medicine.
- True.

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.285
- What can we say about the color black?
- Novices?

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.786
They'll be our prey.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.372
Dude, that sounds so forced.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.458
It was rather embarrassing.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.087
I wonder which side Team SNU will be on.

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.255
Probably over there.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.715
- Med school?
- Yeah.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.300
Which side will Team SNU play?

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.302
Over there, to even things out.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.472
- With an overseas team on our side...
- An overseas team?

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.850
Against SNU, SKKU, and Yonsei?
That sounds tough.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.815
- It's Team SNU.
- Here they come.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.066
TEAM SNU

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.651
Are they Team SNU?

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.291
I guess we're on the black side.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.584
Not med school?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.796
- Are they all STEM?
- Why are they on that side?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.299
Oh, I'm excited.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.384
- Team SNU.
- Hey, this is impressive.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.512
- I agree.
- It's so cool.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.430
Are you nervous?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.390
I'm controlling it.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.769
Is the theme chess for this season?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.149
Maybe we get to play chess.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.277
- Aren't you in the top 0.6%?
- Yes, among the chess players.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.655
Hello, I got an award
in the Korean Olympiad in Informatics,

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.240
priority admission to Seoul Science High,

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.574
and I'm in the top 0.6% in chess.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.992
My name is Kim Gang-hyeon,

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.161
an Industrial Engineering major
at SNU since 2021.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:32.165
I'm in the top 0.6% of the players
on the world's biggest online chess site

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.209
with more than 100 million users.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.753
- You're a real asset to us.
- I can't play Blind Chess, though.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.046
Don't worry about that.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.424
- Jong-yun will help you out.
- Shall I memorize the board for you?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.761
Hello, I won a gold medal
in the International Physics Olympiad.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:48.431
And I've been at the top of my class
with a perfect GPA in college.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.018
I'm Han Jong-yun, majoring
in Physics and Astronomy at SNU in 2024.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.855
I've trained myself
with the mind palace technique.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.356
By using this method,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.984
I was able to memorize
the 40 double-digit numbers

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.278
in under five minutes on the pre-test.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.491
- Team SKKU.
- Here they come.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.243
TEAM SKKU

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.161
Do you think all of them
are in med school?

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.997
If so, they'd be game changers.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.625
I bet other teams are getting tense
from our mere presence.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.878
I'm sure they're starting to sweat.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.005
To be honest,
I think we have the upper hand.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.132
Why do I feel so excited?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.842
I'm loving this already.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:27.554
Hello, I graduated third in my class
at Hansung Science High.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.514
Mathematics and Elite League
are my passions.

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.808
I'm an Elite League geek
and this season's youngest.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:35.353
I'm Kang Ji-hu, studying medicine
at Sungkyunkwan University since 2025.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.856
What do you think your charm is?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.026
I'd say I'm pretty adorable.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.695
- Whose spot is that?
- There at the end?

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.322
There's an empty spot.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.574
There's a mysterious spot
on the white side.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.034
1 EMPTY SPOT IN MEDICAL DIVISION

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.328
- What are the famous med schools?
- Abroad?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.371
Johns Hopkins comes to mind.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.957
- Maybe the University of Tokyo?
- Guys, I think I know.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.542
- It's Yale University.
- Yale?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.710
Yale School of Medicine.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.838
I'm getting worried about this spot.
Why won't they tell us?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.924
Who's going to fill this spot?

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.383
I'm dying to find out.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.310
- Which school is it?
- Is it SNU?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.271
What? But we already have Team SNU.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.190
There are two teams from SNU?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.192
They have a STEM team and a medical team.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.985
It's Team SNU against Team SNU.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.364
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.782
Hey, I recognize him.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.034
The perfect scorer on the CSAT.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.535
It's Lee Seung-hyeon.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.916
Hello, I got a perfect score
in the 2025 CSAT,

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.751
a gold medal
in the International Physics Olympiad,

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.379
and graduated from Seoul Science High
as the valedictorian.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.632
My name is Lee Seung-hyeon,
studying medicine at SNU since 2025.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.677
My favorite field happens to be physics,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.222
so I want to pursue it further
and incorporate it with neuroscience.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:56.810
I want to be a neuroscientist who studies
the brain's physical mechanism.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.396
It's a bit shocking to see
two teams from SNU.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.523
Even if SNU had five teams,
we can beat them all.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:02.899
Which med school ranked first?

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.609
- Yonsei.
- We did.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:05.902
- And dentistry?
- Dentistry, too.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.445
- Yonsei ranked first.
- That we did.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.280
We'll need to stay on our toes.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.991
We can beat them if we focus.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.867
Don't they look super awkward?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.703
- The Team SNUs?
- I agree.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.875
We will now present the complete roster

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.545
of the contestants
for Elite League Season 3.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.424
The first team is Team KAIST.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.843
KIM JAE-HAN
"Top in math at Gyeongsan Science High."

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.053
Top in math at a science high school?

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.306
Hello, I was the top in math
at Gyeongsan Science High

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.684
and placed 10th in math
out of 600 freshmen at KAIST.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:38.935
A math maniac,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.731
I'm Kim Jae-han, currently enrolled
in the School of Freshman at KAIST.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.775
Hello, I'm a recipient
of the Minister of Science and ICT Award,

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.485
placed top in biology
at Busan Science High,

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.362
and only focused on engineering.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:53.158
I'm Kim Ji-u, currently enrolled
in the School of Freshman at KAIST.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.619
Hello, I am fluent in six languages,
a KAIST President Scholarship recipient,

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.455
and a runner-up
in an international chess competition.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.875
I'm Kang Ji-hoo, a Mathematical Sciences
major at KAIST since 2022.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.585
Hey, I know him.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.545
We went to the same high school.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.464
He graduated early.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.424
Hey, he shares your name.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.468
Let's say our own Ji-hu is better.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.261
Our Ji-hu is the real deal.

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:14.929
- We'll call him that.
- Okay.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.557
Hey, Team POSTECH is on the screen.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.393
The second team is Team POSTECH.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.520
"Published the most articles
as a high school student"?

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.773
He must be passionate about research.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.609
- He's a math major.
- Did he publish articles on math?

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.194
That's not an easy feat.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.904
That's pretty awesome.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.739
Seok-hun is a strong contender.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.574
He's "POSTECH's Son Heung-min."

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.326
He does look like Son Heung-min.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.206
I see the resemblance.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.500
He looks more like him in person.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.252
Hello, I've received an A-plus
in a graduate course.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.462
Memorization is my hobby.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.798
I'm Jae Seung-gyu, majoring
in Industrial and Management Engineering

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.216
at POSTECH since 2024.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.926
I enjoy memorizing random information.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:58.598
I memorize capital cities and some facts
about other nations for fun.

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.183
I can list all 196 countries

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.727
based on their latitude
from north to south.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.147
Canada, Russia, Norway,
USA, Finland, Sweden, Iceland,

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.317
UK, Estonia, Latvia, Denmark,
Lithuania, Belarus, Kazakhstan...

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.904
X3 PLAYBACK SPEED

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.739
...Paraguay, Argentina,

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.742
South Africa, Eswatini,
Lesotho, New Zealand, and Uruguay.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.119
ALL 196 COUNTRIES LISTED
That's it.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.372
I'll live up to my nickname
and show a world-class performance.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.417
I scored the highest IQ
at Gyeonggibuk Science High.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.379
I'm the wiz at brain teasers
with maxed stats all around.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.298
I'm Lee Jun-u,
a Computer Science major since 2024.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.385
Hello, I placed 5th
in a national high school coding contest.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.846
I'm the most competitive
engineering major you'll ever meet.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.516
I'm Park Seo-yeon, a freshman
at the School of Undergraduate Studies.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.435
Team POSTECH has people
who speak programming languages.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.730
But we're good since we have someone
from the Olympiad in Informatics.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.234
On top of that, he's a chess wiz.
How cool is that?

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.777
TEAM POSTECH
STEAM DIVISION

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.780
The third team is Team Yonsei.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.409
What's going on over there?

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.661
Hey, we've got all the top students.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.789
Hello, I was the top student
at Sejong Science High.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.375
I got accepted to 5 med schools
with only 2 wrong answers on the CSAT.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.670
My name is Choi A-in, attending
Yonsei's College of Medicine since 2025.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.798
I'm a former SNU engineering student
now studying dentistry at Yonsei.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.842
I was the top in math
at Sejong Science High,

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.635
and my mind is specialized in calculation.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.763
I'm Lee Chung-seo, attending
Yonsei's College of Dentistry since 2025.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.348
I have a natural talent in mathematics,

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.894
so my mathematical essay got me
a spot against 149 other applicants.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:29.689
I'm Lee Yun-beom, attending
Yonsei's College of Dentistry since 2025.

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:30.982
TEAM YONSEI
MEDICAL DIVISION

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.860
Top at Seoul Science High
and top at Sejong Science High.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.695
Top at Seoul Science High?

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:39.407
That's a huge deal
only reserved for true geniuses.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.161
You could say they're the best in Korea
when it comes to math and science.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.662
VALEDICTORIANS FROM SEOUL SCIENCE HIGH

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.831
TEAM YONSEI, PARK SANG-YEON
TEAM SNU, LEE SEUNG-HYEON

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.667
"A gold medal
in the International Physics Olympiad."

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.878
Sang-yeon once graded my papers.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.588
HAN JONG-YUN
GOLD MEDALIST OF IPO

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.715
His mathematical essay
beat 149 competitors?

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.301
That sure is an impressive title to have.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.553
That's real math talent.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.805
You only got two wrong in the CSAT, A-in?

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:03.723
2 WRONG ANSWERS ON CSAT

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.850
- It's good to have you with us.
- Agreed.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.769
Team Yonsei seems formidable.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:09.479
But you scored perfect.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:12.148
LEE SEUNG-HYEON
PERFECT SCORE IN THE 2025 CSAT

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.858
He must've resat the CSAT
while enrolled at SNU.

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.027
How do you feel about being ditched?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.487
It doesn't feel good.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.114
Then again, we took a pass on Yonsei
to go to SNU.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:25.453
The fourth team is Team SNU in STEM.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:28.414
International Physics Olympiad?
Hey, I know that guy.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.208
Han Jong-yun.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.418
I graded his answer and gave him feedback.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.837
- So he's your junior?
- Of course.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.091
He can look forward
to my constructive criticism yet again.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.468
Sang-yeon won gold
two years before I won mine.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:41.719
Who ranked higher?

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.514
In individual ranks?
I was a couple of ranks higher.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.182
Okay, then. We're good.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.435
- I'm better at physics.
- Way to go.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.605
We had two contestants
with a gold medal in the IPO already.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:53.648
Tell me about it.

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.442
He won a medal
in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.986
Hello, I won a gold medal

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.614
in the International Olympiad
on Astronomy and Astrophysics

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.157
and the Talent Award of Korea last year,

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.618
and currently a recipient
of the Presidential Science Scholarship.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.913
I'm Kim Dong-geon, studying
Mathematical Sciences at SNU since 2025.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:12.125
Hi, I placed first in the math competition
at Daegu Science High for the Gifted

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.419
and won an award
in the Research Competition.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.587
I'm Song Myeong-su
with a charming Daegu accent,

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.716
majoring in Energy Resources Engineering
at SNU since 2025.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.801
We look pretty competent.

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:23.469
"A perfect GPA."

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.596
Wow, we've got a model student here.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.890
How does anyone get straight A-pluses?

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.518
Think about the hours
he must've devoted to chess

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.521
- to get in the top 0.6%.
- Yeah, he must be good.

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:37.317
The chess player would have an edge
in turn-based games.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.653
Gang-hyeon gives off the aura
of a strong contender.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.488
TEAM SNU
STEM DIVISION

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.992
The fifth team is Team SKKU.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.329
- They're all in med school.
- Right.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.538
All four of them.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.622
MED, MED, PRE-MED, PRE-MED

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.584
- We're all in medical school.
- Yes, all four of us.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.919
There's someone
with the same name as yours.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.421
Where is he?

00:13:58.504 --> 00:13:59.505
Hello.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.883
TEAM SKKU'S JI-HU
MEETS TEAM KAIST'S JI-HOO

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.969
- We need a face-off between us.
- For sure, you have to.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.346
"International Neuroscience Olympiad"?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.139
You need to be super bright
to compete there.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:11.184
A Neuroscience Olympian
must be good at memorization.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.562
Hello, I represented Korea in
the International Neuroscience Olympiad.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:17.648
I'm Sung Tae-hun,
studying medicine at SKKU since 2022.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.777
Hello, I was the top at Bugil Academy
and got accepted to three medical schools

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.612
without any private tutoring.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:27.283
I'm Kim Dong-yeon,
studying medicine at SKKU since 2022.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:30.870
I started Seoul Science High early
and won a gold medal in the KMO.

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.830
I'm the self-proclaimed
brightest student at SKKU.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.209
I'm Lee Dong-jae,
studying medicine at SKKU since 2023.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.295
Dong-jae is probably in the 32nd cohort
of the Seoul Science High alumni.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.964
Why are there so many people
from Seoul Science High?

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.135
5 GRADUATES OF SEOUL SCIENCE HIGH

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.804
So many Seoul Science High graduates.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:51.265
I think we can attribute that
to Gyu-min's holy graces.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:52.934
"Elite League geek."

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.060
TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.687
He calls himself an Elite League geek.
He's going to be trouble.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.606
We should watch out for guys like him.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.983
I watched both seasons
three times at least

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.735
and even rewatched the BTS clips.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.196
I could also put that in my profile.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.698
I love Elite League, too.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.076
He couldn't have rewatched it
more than I did.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.744
I watched it like eight times.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.501
The sixth team is Team SNU in Medicine.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.088
"Perfect score in the 2025 CSAT"?

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.882
We have another gold medalist in the IPO?

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.010
Does that mean we have three Olympians
with a gold medal?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.640
It's ridiculous how Elite League makes
the IPO look like a cakewalk.

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.725
- Man, the competition is fierce.
- Yeah.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.727
- It will be intense this season.
- Totally.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.063
How did she place first
for all three years at HAFS?

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:43.151
- Wow, she's incredible.
- I can't believe what I'm reading.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.820
She won a silver medal in eighth grade
in the high school KMO?

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:48.156
Man, that's amazing.
She's on another level.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.284
Hello, I was the top student
for all three years at HAFS

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.327
and a KMO silver medalist
when I was in eighth grade.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.622
I'm Han Seo-yeon,
studying medicine at SNU since 2024.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.791
People often praise me as a genius,

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.919
but I can be pretty clumsy,
which is a part of my charm.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.464
Hello, I was the top in math
at Dankook University High School

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:05.548
with dentistry in my blood.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.218
I'm Kim Min-seok,
studying dentistry at SNU since 2023.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.513
Like Hyun-bin, I got into SNU twice.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.057
Like Gyu-min,
I started Science High early.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.060
Like Jun-hyeong, I took Advanced Physics
and Advanced Chemistry.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.689
I'm Joo Min-seo, attending
SNU School of Dentistry since 2025.

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.566
Don't let flashy titles scare you.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.359
Just show them what we're made of.

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.820
But no one's that intimidating so far.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.447
They're all beatable.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.786
We'll get an announcement now.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.914
"Welcome to Elite League.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.249
We will now begin Ace Selection."

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:46.839
Welcome to the brainpower
survival challenge, Elite League Season 3.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.218
In Season 3,

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.430
you will be grouped
into Medical Division and STEM Division

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.475
and have an all-out battle of minds.

00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.393
Is it a group match?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.187
We're grouped into two divisions?

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.731
So all three schools are
on the same division?

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.983
I didn't see this coming.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.777
Team SNU in Medicine,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.028
Team Yonsei,

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.446
and Team SKKU.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.074
These three teams are
in the Medical Division.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.992
Team SNU in STEM,

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.035
Team KAIST,

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.453
and Team POSTECH.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.664
These three teams are
in the STEM Division.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.375
You will be working with students
from other schools.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.377
I guess we'll have to help them out.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.963
First, we will have Ace Selection

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.674
to determine the strongest player
of each division.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.676
One Ace player per division?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.719
Oh, so two Ace players.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:37.223
Then, they will face each other
in the one-on-one Ace Match.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.392
The last person standing

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.143
will receive the benefit,

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:44.480
a game-changing perk
that will affect the main match.

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.816
We need to get that at all costs.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:50.903
The winning three teams of the main match
will move on to the next match.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:54.490
The 2 teams that underperformed
out of 3 three losing teams

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.617
will compete in the Deathmatch.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.995
The two lowest teams
in the losing division?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.080
I think each team gets points
even in group matches

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.873
if there are ranks within the division.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.042
So we're competing against our allies.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.461
Wow, that is brutal.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:13.384
The team defeated in the Deathmatch
will be eliminated immediately.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.636
We'd better win the main matches.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.471
We should be able to win the main match.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.181
STEM Division seems stronger.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.766
- Agreed.
- Right?

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.018
We have the upper hand.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:26.439
Later on, if only one team remains
in either division,

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.191
we will remove
the division setting immediately

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:32.320
and proceed with the competition
between the individual teams.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:37.325
Oh, this should be fun.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.827
We get two allies for now.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.623
- Yes, but it's a temporary alliance.
- It's just temporary.

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:46.208
If one team in Medical Division
gets eliminated,

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.753
- we can have it pretty easy.
- It's a win for us.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.004
We must win on Day 1.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:52.173
Once we get one team out of the picture,

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.759
- we can outnumber them 12 to 8.
- Exactly.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.641
The winning team will be awarded
a scholarship of 80 million won in total,

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:06.103
each member receiving 20 million won.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.647
That sounds enticing.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.939
We're collecting that.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.691
- For my tuition.
- We'll get it.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.444
Before we start the game,

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.864
we will now announce
the results of the pre-test.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.658
- What? I did poorly.
- I'm doomed.

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.618
- I bombed it.
- They're showing everything?

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.204
They're sharing the results?

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.163
I'm getting nervous.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.500
Wait, the pressure is getting to me.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.043
My heart started racing.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.087
I'm feeling pretty confident.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.758
Here are the pre-test results
of the STEM Division contestants.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.510
Fourth place.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:41.263
Team SNU's Mathematical Sciences major,
Kim Dong-geon.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.558
4TH PLACE IN STEM DIVISION:
TEAM SNU, KIM DONG-GEON

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.851
I bet we're all in the top 4.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.269
- Looks that way.
- That'd be nice.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.562
Third place.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:55.027
Team KAIST's Semiconductor System
Engineering major, Jeon Ji-min.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.614
3RD PLACE IN STEM DIVISION:
TEAM KAIST, JEON JI-MIN

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.158
Let's remember his name.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.493
Second place.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:06.497
Team SNU's Industrial Engineering major,
Kim Gang-hyeon.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.416
It's looking great, guys.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.626
Man, Team SNU.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.295
- He's the chess player.
- Yeah.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:14.588
First place.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.340
I wonder who placed first.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.635
Please don't tell me
it's another member from Team SNU.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:21.303
Looking forward to hearing your name?

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.097
- Of course not.
- First place.

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.309
Team POSTECH?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.145
First place.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.732
Team SNU's Physics and Astronomy major,
Han Jong-yun.

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.735
1ST PLACE IN STEM DIVISION:
TEAM SNU, HAN JONG-YUN

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.028
- They have three in the lead.
- I know.

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:40.197
I managed to squeeze in between them.

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.907
Let's do better from now on.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.659
Consider it a strategic retreat
to gain traction.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.412
- Team SNU's strong as expected.
- Hands down.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:47.538
STEM DIVISION PRE-TEST RANKINGS

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.373
We'd better do just as well.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:57.173
Next, here are the pre-test results
of the Medical Division contestants.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.049
Seung-hyeon will come in first.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.843
- I suppose so.
- Fourth place.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.558
Team SNU's pre-med, Lee Seung-hyeon.

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.810
4TH PLACE IN MEDICAL DIVISION:
TEAM SNU, LEE SEUNG-HYEON

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.606
I guess we were wrong.

00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:15.983
Seung-hyeon only placed fourth?

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.695
I can't say I wasn't disappointed,
but I wasn't overly worried.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.030
Third place.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.993
Team SNU's pre-med, Han Seo-yeon.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.996
3RD PLACE IN MEDICAL DIVISION:
TEAM SNU, HAN SEO-YEON

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.957
I felt disappointed
about missing first place,

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:35.753
but that motivated me further
to do better in the actual match.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.422
Don't tell me Team SNU
took all the top slots.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.216
It can't be Team SNU all the way, right?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.426
- That'd tank our confidence.
- For sure.

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.054
Second place.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.557
Team Yonsei's pre-med,

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.809
Choi A-in.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.644
I told you we'd be in the top four.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.063
2ND PLACE IN MEDICAL DIVISION:
TEAM YONSEI, CHOI A-IN

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.523
I beat Team SNU in Medicine.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:56.857
Damn straight.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.527
I get the feeling we're the underdogs.

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:03.614
- Do we have the first place among us?
- Probably in the other teams.

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.533
I bet it's the top student
of Seoul Science High.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.743
You mean that guy in Team Yonsei?

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:08.994
First place.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.707
Team SKKU's pre-med, Kang Ji-hu.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:15.543
1ST PLACE IN MEDICAL DIVISION:
TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.127
- What?
- How did this happen?

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:20.965
...Kang Ji-hu.

00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.049
TEAM KAIST'S KANG JI-HOO

00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:24.260
- What?
- Way to go, Ji-hoo.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.887
JI-HOO AND JI-HU CELEBRATING TOGETHER

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.098
- Follow my lead.
- Cool.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.933
- That's lit.
- Totally.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:34.645
Team SKKU...

00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:37.690
- It's only the pre-test.
- You've got a point.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.067
- We'd better win.
- Let's do well in the main game.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.027
- We'll win, right?
- Sure, let's beat them.

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.906
I can't believe we lost to Team SKKU.

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:47.533
That's impressive.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.785
- I know.
- He's a true Elite League geek.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:52.121
Teams in Medical Division
seem evenly matched.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.499
Overall, we have a better balance
than the STEM Division.

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:59.044
- Yes, all three teams are pretty strong.
- Looks that way.

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:01.213
All teams have at least one top contender.

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:03.215
1ST: KANG JI-HU, TEAM SKKU
2ND: CHOI A-IN, TEAM YONSEI

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.301
3RD: HAN SEO-YEON, TEAM SNU
4TH: LEE SEUNG-HYEON, TEAM SNU

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:09.346
We will now announce
the contestant with the highest score

00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:12.766
across both STEM Division
and Medical Division.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.978
- My heart is beating like crazy.
- I bet it's Team SKKU.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.566
I hope it's you.

00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:26.530
The overall top scorer in the pre-test...

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.365
Oh, please.

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:29.825
Let's pray it's Jong-yun.

00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:36.749
- I bet it's you, Ji-hu.
- You never know.

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.834
The overall top scorer in the pre-test...

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.294
MEDICAL: KANG JI-HU
STEM: HAN JONG-YUN

00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:43.213
...is Team SKKU's pre-med, Kang Ji-hu.

00:23:43.297 --> 00:23:44.715
OVERALL 1ST PLACE:
SKKU, KANG JI-HU

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.847
He wasn't exaggerating
about being an Elite League geek.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.433
- He must've nailed the memorization.
- I guess so.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.143
- How cool is that?
- Gosh.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.103
- I did okay.
- That's our Ji-hu.

00:23:59.897 --> 00:24:02.316
Looks like he came determined to win.

00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:05.903
He has that glint in his eyes.

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:11.033
Since it's Team SKKU's first appearance,
I'm sure some people will be skeptical.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.995
I promise to dispel all your doubts
with excellent performances.

00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:19.166
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.293
The first game of the new season

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.671
is Ace Selection.

00:24:23.754 --> 00:24:24.964
- How exciting.
- Yeah.

00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.340
I wonder what's in store.

00:24:26.423 --> 00:24:27.841
Kang Ji-hu, that little rascal.

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.094
I'm going to beat you.

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:35.349
Today's Ace Selection
will test your calculation skills.

00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:37.768
Calculation is a specialty
of medical students.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.145
You can multiply 2 double-digit numbers
around 3 seconds, right?

00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:43.482
- Yes, around three seconds.
- I'm confident about calculations.

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:44.483
Please note

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:50.406
that only two contestants
can participate per team.

00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:52.032
Hold on, what was that?

00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.326
- Not the entire team?
- In the next ten minutes,

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.704
discuss with your teammates
at your base camps

00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:01.375
and decide on who will participate
in Ace Selection.

00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:03.669
I'm excited.

00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:05.504
It feels like the moment before an exam.

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:11.677
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:13.595
TRUTH IS MY LIGHT

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.726
- Oh, nice.
- Look.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.602
"Truth is my light."

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:22.563
Look at this.

00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:24.064
- It's neat.
- It says "SNU."

00:25:24.148 --> 00:25:25.399
I'm swelling with pride.

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:27.484
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:29.153
That's so old.

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:31.488
BORN IN 2003, BORN IN 2007
"Old"?

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:32.990
- "KAIST."
- We have coffee, too.

00:25:33.824 --> 00:25:36.243
- Mega Coffee.
- Hey, it's Mega Coffee.

00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:39.329
My left side looks better.
Can you switch with me?

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.374
- To take over the camera?
- I'll sit like this, then.

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.126
Oh, come on.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.005
It's so good.

00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:51.759
- Let's discuss our calculation skills.
- Yes.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.427
- We only have ten minutes.
- Right.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:56.180
- We don't know what we'll be calculating.
- That's true.

00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:58.057
Let's share our best records

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.349
- on the calculation app.
- Then,

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.727
- how's your two-digit multiplication?
- Two-digit?

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.729
It takes me 5 to 6 seconds.

00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:06.273
- I'm in the high three-second range.
- On average?

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:08.525
- Average of ten multiplications.
- I see.

00:26:08.609 --> 00:26:13.113
And I've got the factorials
and the exponents memorized.

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:14.865
How far can you cover?

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.366
3 TO THE 7TH POWER
That's 2187.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.534
3 TO THE 8TH POWER
That's 6561.

00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:19.286
3 TO THE 9TH POWER
That's 19683.

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.246
3 TO THE 11TH POWER
That's 177147.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.372
5 TO THE 5TH POWER
It's 3125.

00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:23.957
5 TO THE 6TH POWER
It's 15625.

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:25.417
5 TO THE 8TH POWER
It's 390625.

00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:26.668
You're killing it.

00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:28.545
We're so lucky to have you.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.340
- I'd like Seok-hun to compete.
- Okay.

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.842
No one could've memorized
as much as I did.

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:35.302
- I'm sure of it.
- Really?

00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:36.428
Okay, Seok-hun's in.

00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:37.513
SQUARE OF 51
That's 2601.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:38.555
SQUARE OF 52
That's 2704.

00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:39.932
SQUARE OF 53
That's 2809.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.018
SQUARE OF 54, SQUARE OF 55
Those are 2916 and 3025.

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.478
SQUARE OF 56, SQUARE OF 57
Next are 3136 and 3249.

00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:45.813
SQUARE OF 58
Then 3364.

00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:46.855
SQUARE OF 59
Next is 3481.

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:47.773
SQUARE OF 60
Then 3600.

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:49.191
Okay, good.

00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.276
It's time to decide. Any volunteers?

00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:54.613
I think I have the most factorials
and exponents memorized.

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.366
What's the square of 43?

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.618
It's 1849.

00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.912
What about the square of 66?

00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:04.123
We get 3960 and 396,
so the answer is 4356.

00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:05.040
You're quick.

00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.709
- What about 3 to the 11th power?
- It's 177147.

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.711
You really are on another level.

00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:12.047
We need one more contestant.

00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:13.966
Chung-seo said he felt confident about it.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:15.968
- Join me, Chung-seo.
- Okay.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.303
Chung-seo's math skills are unparalleled.

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:20.389
HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS
I can vouch for him.

00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:22.558
Okay, I'll share a few tricks.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.060
Sang-yeon, you sound like a teacher.

00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.436
It suits you.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.563
Here's the square of n.

00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:31.191
First is n minus 25 multiplied by 100,

00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:33.902
then n minus 50 squared.

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:36.488
This is useful
when we square a big number.

00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:37.948
- I see.
- About 50?

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.410
For example, let's say
we need 223 squared.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.453
Subtract 25 from 223, and we get 198.

00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:45.330
Right, 198 times 100 is...

00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:46.331
Exactly.

00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:48.167
- Next is 173 squared.
- Right.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.210
We can give 173 squared
the same treatment.

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:53.839
So that's how it goes.

00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:55.382
Let's try it again.

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:56.300
REPEAT THE PROCESS

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:57.593
Finally, we get 23 squared.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:58.969
FINAL EQUATION

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:01.013
We now have to add these up.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.765
Hey, you're right. It's neat.

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:06.560
Add 529 to 49200, and we get our answer.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:09.688
- That sped up the whole thing.
- You bet.

00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.649
Let's do some drills.
How about a few rounds of mental math?

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:18.113
- You can turn around now.
- I can?

00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:19.948
Do I just crack on?

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.077
- It's 3766.
- Correct.

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.246
Take it up a notch.

00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:32.211
- Is it 16492?
- Oh, wow.

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:33.879
You're awesome.

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:37.549
I just remembered, Gang-hyeon.
You wrote that your hobby is mental math.

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:38.675
HOBBY IS MENTAL MATH

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:40.093
You two can take this.

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:41.720
Good luck, Seoul Science High graduates.

00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.764
SEOUL SCIENCE HIGH DUO
KIM DONG-GEON AND KIM GANG-HYEON

00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:45.974
So, in a nutshell,

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.727
claiming the benefit in this game
is a huge plus.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:49.770
Exactly.

00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:53.607
Even if we can't, it'd be better
if a Medical Division team took it

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.860
- For sure.
- for the good of our team.

00:28:56.944 --> 00:29:00.614
The last question of the pre-test

00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:03.033
- asked us to crunch numbers.
- Right.

00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:06.119
- How long did it take you?
- I can't recall.

00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:08.622
I think it took around ten seconds for me.

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:12.626
I'd say our options have been decided.

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:15.462
Our safe bet is going with you two.

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.130
- We'll do it.
- Okay, let's go.

00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:19.466
- It'd be great if either of us wins.
- It's not a main match.

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.094
It's only a benefit match, so no pressure.

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.470
If you guys find it hard,

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:25.305
- it's worse for them.
- He's right.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:28.684
Any volunteers?

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:31.728
Ji-hoo trained himself in mental math.
Why don't you give it a go?

00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.480
- Double-digit multiplication...
- It's your thing.

00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:35.482
I have faith in you.

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:36.858
We need one more.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.822
I won't refuse.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:44.533
- Have we decided, then?
- Yes.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.535
I'd like Ji-hu to compete.

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.662
- He's super quick.
- Yes, let's send him.

00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:51.623
- Do you want to try, Dong-jae?
- If you want me to.

00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:52.708
- You're in?
- Okay.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.168
TEAM SKKU: KANG JI-HU AND LEE DONG-JAE

00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:56.461
Are you ready, Mr. First Place?

00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.255
I sure am.

00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:00.048
- No pressure.
- Don't sweat it.

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.009
- We don't need the benefit to win.
- That's right.

00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:04.219
Honestly, I don't think I have it in me.

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:06.346
- To lose, that is.
- That's the spirit.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.681
I love that.

00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:09.433
- Great.
- Keep it up.

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.352
The time for strategy meeting is up.

00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:13.937
Let's go get that benefit.

00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:15.772
Team SNU is the reigning champion.

00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:17.941
- Right.
- Let's crush their spirits.

00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:19.526
- SNU!
- For independence!

00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:23.238
Let's show them how it's done.

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:26.825
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:29.036
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:30.037
Akaraka!

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.580
- Let's go, Yonsei!
- Let's go!

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.457
- POSTECH!
- Let's go!

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.043
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:39.838
The contestants competing
in the Ace Selection,

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.508
please gather in the Main Hall.

00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.678
Look, Ji-hu's playing.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:47.721
Ji-hu.

00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:49.556
- Ji-hu.
- I like it.

00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:54.436
The first Ace Selection is...

00:30:58.065 --> 00:30:58.982
ACE SELECTION

00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:00.734
...Parallel Equation.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.487
- It's a brand-new game.
- What's that?

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.447
I can't even imagine.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.574
Are we supposed to build equations?

00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:08.909
ACE SELECTION
PARALLEL EQUATION

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:10.035
In Parallel Equation,

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:12.245
you will be presented
with a pair of 5-by-5 boards,

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.456
each filled with a different set
of equations.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:19.294
Your task is to find two pairs of formulas
with the same results across the boards.

00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:20.212
ANSWERS: 5, 60

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:24.007
So only two pairs match
out of all the equations?

00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:25.509
This requires memorization.

00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:27.219
- Does it?
- Yes, it'd be hard

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.721
to compare all the numbers one by one.

00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:34.017
The first person to answer correctly
in each division wins the game.

00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:37.187
They will then be named
the Ace player of their division.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.314
- It's really tough to strategize.
- I know.

00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:40.357
What should we do?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.193
Our best option is to determine
based on the last digit.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.237
Let's use a different algorithm.

00:31:46.363 --> 00:31:48.407
- Good. Sure.
- You take the top, and I'll start below.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.075
I'll handle the upper rows.
You take the rest.

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.701
Sounds great.

00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:55.247
This is Ace Selection.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.666
We'll now begin Parallel Equation.

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:02.587
Here are your boards.

00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:06.007
Gosh, hang on.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.717
They went too far.

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:10.762
They threw in a bunch
of 2-digit times 3-digit equations.

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:16.601
I mean, I was baffled.
I sensed this might not be easy.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:20.272
Once I see numbers,
my mind runs them by itself.

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:21.231
I felt confident.

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:24.943
Honestly, I've refined
my calculation skills for so long.

00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:26.570
I felt like I could make it.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.743
I see so many formulas
with similar results.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.954
- I can't find the pairs.
- Same.

00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:37.998
I'm not having any luck.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.544
I couldn't find the answers quickly.
That's when I panicked.

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:44.838
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:00.770
One contestant submitted
the correct answers for Parallel Equation.

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:02.063
EACH DIVISION GETS ONE ACE PLAYER

00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:05.400
STEM Division.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.115
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
has been chosen as the Ace player.

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:14.701
STEM DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER:
TEAM KAIST, JEON JI-MIN

00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:17.829
That's insane.

00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:21.124
When I saw the two boards,

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:24.628
the different symbols in the formulas
stood out to me.

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.631
Depending on the symbol,
I could get a two-digit number

00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:28.924
or a four-digit number.

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:31.092
That general divide caught my attention.

00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:33.470
So I factored that in
and compared the formulas

00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:36.598
whose results would likely have
the same number of digits.

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:37.849
After that,

00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:41.520
I worked out the last digit quickly
to find the matching results.

00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:43.522
What a shame.

00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:46.316
Gosh, what a legend.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.653
He's really good. I'm impressed.

00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:54.407
MEDICAL DIVISION DOESN'T HAVE
AN ACE PLAYER YET

00:33:55.325 --> 00:33:57.244
We've got to do well here.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:09.297
Medical Division.

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.344
Medical Division.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:18.223
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
has been chosen as the Ace player.

00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:20.934
When Ji-min found the answers
quicker than I did,

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:22.269
I was pretty startled.

00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:25.397
But that only hardened my drive
to beat him in the Ace Match.

00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:29.943
- He's a strong player.
- Wow, Kang Ji-hu.

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:31.403
He's exceptional.

00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:33.780
Is he the one who placed first
in the pre-test?

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:36.074
ACED THE PRE-TEST AND THE GAME
He's amazing.

00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:39.619
The answers are 66 and 1392.

00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:45.500
Contestants excepting the Ace players,
please return to your base camps.

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:46.418
Good luck.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:47.752
You've got this. Go for it.

00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:48.670
Good luck!

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.171
Give it all you've got.

00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:51.756
Go for it, STEM Division.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.676
TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU
VS TEAM KAIST, JEON JI-MIIN

00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:57.095
- Good work.
- You did great.

00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:58.888
- Ji-hu managed to win.
- Yeah.

00:34:58.972 --> 00:34:59.806
Good job.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.683
- I'm back.
- Hey, Ji-hoo.

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.893
- Great work out there.
- It must've been rough.

00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:06.271
Turns out Ji-min is a genius.

00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:09.774
There's our Ace player.
He's so freaking cool.

00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:15.030
Now,

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:19.367
let us begin the Ace Match.

00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:26.124
Ji-hu's mind is just exceptional.
It must work at lightspeed.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.792
Wasn't Ji-min also among those

00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.462
- who did well on the pre-test?
- Yes, he was.

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:35.300
3RD PLACE IN STEM DIVISION
VS OVERALL 1ST PLACE

00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:36.384
Shall we make a bet?

00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.011
- On the winner?
- Yes.

00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:40.555
I'm hoping Team KAIST will win.

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:41.973
I hope Team SKKU will win.

00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:43.516
Yeah, that'd be for the best.

00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:46.770
- Let's go, Ji-hu.
- You've got this, Ji-hu.

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.438
- Let's do this.
- Good luck.

00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.524
Please win this, Ji-min.

00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.783
Today's Ace Match is...

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:05.330
Primality Test.

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:07.290
PRIME NUMBERS: NATURAL NUMBERS
ONLY DIVISIBLE BY 1 AND ITSELF

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:10.752
When it comes to prime numbers,
STEM Division has the upper hand.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.295
"Primality Test"? Shoot.

00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:14.881
I'm good at that.

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.341
In Primality Test,

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:21.096
your task is to quickly determine
if the presented number is a prime number.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.807
A correct answer will grant you points.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.022
Ji-hu will ace this.
It's basically just division.

00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.148
He won't have any problem.

00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:33.566
Before the game begins,

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.237
both players will be given
a deck of numbered cards.

00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:41.658
Numbers 1, 2, and 3
are printed on white cards.

00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:45.328
Numbers 4, 5, and 6
are printed on gray cards.

00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:49.499
Numbers 7, 8, and 9
are printed on black cards.

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.293
When the game begins,

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:55.588
the first player will be given 30 seconds

00:36:55.672 --> 00:37:01.678
to submit a card with its back showing
for the hundreds or the tens place.

00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:07.308
Then, the second player will submit a card
for the remaining slot.

00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:12.313
The different colors should tell you
the general range of the number.

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.065
- That's right.
- I see.

00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:16.985
The first player can frame
the number ahead.

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.445
The host has four cards,

00:37:18.528 --> 00:37:23.950
numbered 1, 3, 7, and 9.

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:26.870
His submission will always be placed
in the ones place.

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:31.791
Afterwards, the three-digit number
will be revealed.

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:36.963
Determine whether the number is a prime
and hit the buzzer.

00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:40.091
You will then get five seconds
to state your answer.

00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:43.219
- Just five seconds?
- That would be pretty rough.

00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:45.680
If your answer is correct,
you will win two points.

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:49.684
If not, you will lose one point.

00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:53.021
Please remember that the card
you submitted can't be reused

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.148
in the following rounds.

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:59.402
But the host may reuse his card
for the upcoming rounds.

00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:03.156
If you also memorize
which card the opponent submitted,

00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.741
you'll have a better shot at winning.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.243
Do you think card counting works here?

00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:08.870
It'd be incredible if it did.

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:11.748
This game has nine rounds in total.

00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:13.208
In Round 9,

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.752
you will be presented
with a four-digit number.

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:17.879
Once all rounds are completed,

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:21.966
the player with more points
will be declared the winner.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:26.304
The winner of the Ace Match

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:30.934
will be awarded a benefit
to be used in the upcoming main match.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.603
I wonder if the whole division
could benefit from it.

00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:36.189
I think so,
since it'll be a division match.

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.733
You will be given ten minutes
to strategize.

00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:42.529
You can select one contestant
in your division

00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:45.114
to discuss strategies with.

00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:51.538
Please name one contestant
from your division

00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:53.623
to discuss your strategy with.

00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:56.417
- That's a new twist.
- It sure is. But wait.

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:58.962
We don't know much
about those on the other teams.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:02.257
But then again,
we have the results from the pre-test,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.092
so he'll probably choose
one of the top contenders.

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.387
- Won't he ask for Team SNU's math major?
- I think he'll name his teammate.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:08.429
- Team KAIST?
- Yes.

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:11.015
They've stayed together so far,
so I think he'll call his teammate.

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:14.352
I knew I had to name someone
with an affinity for numbers

00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:17.981
and quick calculation skills.

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:20.650
I wonder who Ji-min will name.

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:23.486
- Probably a math major.
- It'd be you, then.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:24.571
TEAM POSTECH, HWANG SEOK-HUN

00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:25.697
TEAM KAIST, KANG JI-HOO

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.656
TEAM SNU, KIM DONG-GEON

00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:32.120
Ji-hu doesn't really need a strategy
because he can easily crunch numbers.

00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:36.249
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
from the STEM Division,

00:39:36.332 --> 00:39:38.251
please select your advisor.

00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:41.337
I'll go with Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.464
- Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
- What?

00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:46.009
JI-MIN CHOOSES JAE-HAN,
A FUTURE MATHEMATICS MAJOR

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:48.428
At the end of the day,
only one team can be the final winner.

00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:53.057
I thought good teamwork was crucial,
so I selected one of my teammates.

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:56.769
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
from Medical Division,

00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:58.313
please select your advisor.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.441
I'll go with Team SKKU's Sung Tae-hun.

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.610
I could handle numbers well enough,

00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:07.697
so I went with Tae-hun
to get extra help on strategies.

00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:12.827
Team SKKU's Sung Tae-hun,
please come to the Main Hall.

00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:19.417
You will hold the strategy meeting
in the room assigned to your division,

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.502
and you'll be given ten minutes.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:22.545
DIVISION ROOM

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.465
Please go to the Division Room.

00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:28.843
ACE MATCH
PRIMALITY TEST

00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.845
STEM DIVISION ROOM

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:35.767
- We're the first to use this room.
- Let's memorize those numbers.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.311
Can you write down multiples of 29?
I'll take on multiples of 23.

00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:43.232
I felt sure I could divide the number
into smaller primes easily.

00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:47.320
So I wanted to invest the time
into memorizing multiples of 23 and 29.

00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:51.783
The chances of getting
a non-prime are pretty high.

00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:52.742
That's true.

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:54.786
THERE ARE ONLY 168 PRIME NUMBERS
FROM 1 TO 999

00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:56.079
- Way higher.
- Right.

00:40:56.162 --> 00:41:00.083
I win 2 points for a correct answer
and lose 1 point for a wrong answer.

00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:03.878
Let's say I manage to widen the margin
early on in the game.

00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:06.714
My chances of winning are good,
even if I keep on saying it's a non-prime.

00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:07.757
That's true.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.426
TEAM KAIST BUILDS THEIR STRATEGY
ON THE NUMBER OF PRIMES

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.344
MEDICAL DIVISION ROOM

00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:13.012
Between 1 and 999...

00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.597
- How many are there?
- There are 168.

00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:15.556
- Exactly 168?
- Yes.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.766
Here's the thing.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:18.685
Since the number will always end
in 1, 3, 7, or 9,

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:20.979
- we're left with 400 numbers.
- Right.

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:23.481
So the odds of it being a prime
are about half.

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:25.149
PROBABILITY OF THE TARGET NUMBER
BEING A PRIME: 42%

00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:27.819
I have about 50% chance
of being presented a prime.

00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:30.321
So, the chances of it
being a non-prime aren't that high.

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:31.531
OPPOSITE ANALYSIS

00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:33.992
Give me a few numbers.

00:41:34.075 --> 00:41:35.076
- Random ones?
- Yes.

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:36.703
How's 157?

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:38.871
It is a prime.

00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:40.039
It is indeed a prime.

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:43.209
Because there was a high chance
the target number could be a prime,

00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:45.753
I thought practice runs
would be effective.

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:47.672
What about 199?

00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:48.965
It is a prime.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.174
What about 317?

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:52.885
It is a prime.

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:53.886
Tell me about 761.

00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:57.640
It is a prime.

00:41:57.724 --> 00:41:59.058
- That is correct.
- Yeah, I know.

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:00.727
Why are there so many primes?

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.521
- There are many more than you'd think.
- You're right.

00:42:04.105 --> 00:42:05.481
Wait, the order.

00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:07.233
We need to think about the order.

00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:09.569
Which would be better,
going first or going second?

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.864
If I go first, then I go first
in the final round as well.

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:15.450
- Yes, even in Round 9.
- Right.

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:18.828
But wouldn't it be better
to go second more?

00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:20.329
You want to go second more?

00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.832
Let's say Ji-hu submits a card
after I've analyzed his remaining deck.

00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:25.251
I can guess his card if I go second.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.377
Yes, you're right.

00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.924
If I'm given the choice,
I'll select going second.

00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:36.262
Let's say you have to go first.

00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:39.098
In that case, you should
always select the hundreds place.

00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:41.350
OPPOSITE STRATEGY
That way, you get more time to think

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.019
- while Ji-min selects his card.
- Right.

00:42:43.436 --> 00:42:44.979
I'll hand in the card with number one

00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:47.774
- and hit the buzzer right away.
- Good idea.

00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:49.067
- One more thing.
- Yes?

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:52.028
If your mind goes blank
despite our strategy,

00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:53.237
follow your intuition.

00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:54.947
- If it looks like a prime,
- Trust your gut.

00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:56.157
I'll hit the buzzer.

00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:58.993
I can see you have
a good grasp of the primes.

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.537
Okay, I'll trust my instincts.

00:43:02.038 --> 00:43:04.624
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

00:43:04.874 --> 00:43:06.834
- You've got this.
- Wish me luck.

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:09.796
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:14.050
I am getting pretty nervous.

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:16.928
I've got this.

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.722
All right. Let's get it.

00:43:22.558 --> 00:43:25.770
Ace players of each division,

00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:30.233
please return to the Main Hall
for the match.

00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:44.288
- Good luck.
- Let's do our best.

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.589
It was a chance to see
what I'm capable of.

00:43:53.673 --> 00:43:55.842
I knew I had to beat the opponent.

00:43:56.759 --> 00:44:00.721
I wanted to score the points first
to take control of the game.

00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.390
In Ace Selection,

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:05.685
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min typed in
the correct answer first.

00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.771
As a result,
he will decide on the player order.

00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:10.857
I'll go second.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.692
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min will go second.

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:16.529
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu will go first.

00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:21.534
- So cool.
- How cute.

00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:24.662
Don't let nerves get to you, Ji-hu.
You're the top contender.

00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:27.081
Please...

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:29.625
Team KAIST chose to go second.

00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:32.628
- He must have a plan, then.
- Yeah, it looks like it.

00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:34.839
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:36.174
Please submit a card

00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:39.343
and state whether you want it
in the first or the second digit.

00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:45.099
The first digit, please.

00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:52.315
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU SUBMITS
A WHITE CARD FOR THE HUNDREDS PLACE

00:44:52.398 --> 00:44:54.317
Are the white cards 1, 2, and 3?

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.652
Yes, white cards have 1, 2, or 3 on them.

00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:58.988
A white card is basically
like throwing a gauntlet.

00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:01.908
- Ji-hu's planning to intimidate Ji-min.
- That's right.

00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:04.952
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please submit a card.

00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:08.789
I could see where Ji-hu was going
with his first card.

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:12.919
He was going first,
so he would've wanted to predict my card.

00:45:13.002 --> 00:45:15.588
I assumed his choice would be number one.

00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:17.632
So I decided to submit number one too

00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:21.302
and hit the buzzer immediately
after the target number was revealed.

00:45:22.011 --> 00:45:23.095
The second digit, please.

00:45:23.179 --> 00:45:24.597
WHITE CARDS IN BOTH PLACES

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.474
- Did we get two white cards?
- Yes.

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.517
It's a face-off.

00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:30.811
HOST'S CARD SUBMITTED

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:33.689
I'll now reveal the target number
for Round 1 of Primality Test.

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:49.247
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:50.831
It is a prime.

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:53.834
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:55.795
That is correct.

00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.588
You won two points.

00:45:57.672 --> 00:46:00.049
KANG JI-HU: 2, JEON JI-MIN: 0

00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:01.133
Bummer.

00:46:02.885 --> 00:46:05.012
- Oh, man.
- What a shame.

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:09.267
In Round 2,
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min will go first.

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.282
The first digit, please.

00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.994
TEAM KAIST'S JEON JI-MIN SUBMITS
A BLACK CARD FOR THE HUNDREDS PLACE

00:46:28.077 --> 00:46:29.954
- That cranked it up a notch.
- Right.

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:34.000
I think the first player should submit
a bigger number

00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:35.876
to make it hard to run the numbers.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:42.717
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU ALSO SUBMITS
A BLACK CARD FOR THE TENS PLACE

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.761
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 2.

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.185
Oh, he hit the buzzer first.

00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:54.854
Is 779 a prime?

00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:57.148
- I think it's a prime.
- It is a prime.

00:46:58.774 --> 00:47:01.610
It's not a prime.

00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:05.031
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.910
That is correct. You won two points.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.290
KANG JI-HU: 2, JEON JI-MIN: 2

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:22.340
- It's a multiple of 19.
- That's a multiple of 19?

00:47:22.423 --> 00:47:23.966
Right, I just remembered 76.

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:27.595
- Did he guess it was a multiple of 19?
- He did great.

00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:29.847
I'm getting chills.

00:47:31.724 --> 00:47:35.728
In Round 3,
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu will go first.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.364
The first digit, please.

00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.953
The second digit, please.

00:47:57.083 --> 00:48:00.878
JEON JI-MIN SUBMITTED
BLACK CARDS BACK-TO-BACK

00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:03.798
- He used two of his black cards.
- Right.

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.008
If he uses the final black card
in the last round...

00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:07.927
Ji-hu can easily guess what it is.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.011
That's true.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.807
I had used one black card already.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.601
If I had kept the black cards
and used them as the first player,

00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:18.396
Ji-hu would've made a perfect prediction.

00:48:18.646 --> 00:48:21.857
So I decided to submit the cards
I wouldn't need later early on.

00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:24.360
That was why I used up the black cards
when going second.

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:28.155
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 3.

00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:33.452
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:35.704
It is a prime.

00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:38.749
- Please...
- Is it?

00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.174
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
That is incorrect.

00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:50.136
You lost one point.

00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:51.679
KANG JI-HU: 2, JEON JI-MIN: 1

00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:54.056
Oh, no.

00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.309
At a glance, it looks like a prime.

00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:58.853
I agree.

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.439
It's a multiple of 17.

00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:04.483
Multiples of 17 are difficult to catch.
I didn't think we'd get one.

00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:08.571
Because Ji-hu was fast,

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:12.450
I felt pressured to hit the buzzer
even before I finished the calculation.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.914
In Round 4,
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min will go first.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.294
The first digit, please.

00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:30.134
I submitted a gray card for the first time
to make it difficult for Ji-hu to predict.

00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:37.475
The second digit, please.

00:49:37.892 --> 00:49:39.643
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 4.

00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:48.110
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:49.487
It is a prime.

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:55.159
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu. That is correct.

00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.745
You won two points.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.289
KANG JI-HU: 4, JEON JI-MIN: 1

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:02.583
There we go.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.293
What a good boy.

00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:06.378
- I'm falling in love with him.
- He's our cutie.

00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:07.838
- How adorable.
- I love him.

00:50:11.258 --> 00:50:14.094
- How can he answer it so quickly?
- I wonder that, too.

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:16.263
- How does he get it so quickly?
- I know.

00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:19.475
I think he memorized
all the three-digit prime numbers.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.936
That's doable.

00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:26.482
In Round 5,
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu will go first.

00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:31.987
The first digit, please.

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:36.617
- It's either 2 or 3.
- Right, it's one of those.

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.745
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please select a card.

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:54.260
I thought I hit a dead end.

00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:57.513
The only way out was
hitting the buzzer first.

00:50:57.846 --> 00:51:00.349
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 5.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.398
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:08.899
It is a prime.

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:16.407
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu. That is correct.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.158
You won two points.

00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.743
KANG JI-HU: 6, JEON JI-MIN: 1

00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:24.665
He must've been going over all the primes
in the 300s after submitting 3.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.835
You've got to know them all
to answer that fast.

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:30.838
Ji-hu knew Ji-min didn't have four.
So when Ji-min submitted a gray card,

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.048
that narrowed down the possibilities
from 350 to 370.

00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:35.759
Ji-hu must be counting
the numbers for real.

00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:38.387
Ji-hu seems to be using
his raw calculation ability.

00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:41.849
Hang on.

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:45.894
If Ji-min lets Ji-hu take one more round,
the game is over.

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:48.606
- He'll have to take a gamble, then.
- Yeah.

00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.107
- He has to...
- Just hit the buzzer

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.443
- and try to answer.
- Yes, he has to react fast.

00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:57.239
In Round 6,
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min will go first.

00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:09.835
The first digit, please.

00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:16.592
The second digit, please.

00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:22.181
- That's either 2 or 3.
- Ji-min's card has either 2 or 3.

00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:24.850
Ji-hu's card is either 8 or 9.

00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:27.770
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 6.

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:36.862
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:38.822
It is not a prime.

00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:44.370
Come on.

00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.459
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.046
That is incorrect.

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:57.466
KANG JI-HU: 6, JEON JI-MIN: 0
You lost 1 point.

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:03.263
He can still make a comeback
if he gets the rest right.

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:10.813
In Round 7,
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu will go first.

00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:21.532
The second digit, please.

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.911
He went for the second digit
when he's going first?

00:53:25.994 --> 00:53:28.163
He thinks he has the game in the bag.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:33.711
I knew all of Ji-min's remaining cards,
so I deliberately chose the tens place.

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.178
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 7.

00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:49.184
It is not a prime.

00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:51.395
- Nice!
- Let's go!

00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:54.440
Gosh, Ji-min knew about 299, too.

00:53:54.773 --> 00:53:56.108
Ji-hu played like a true geek.

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.860
- He knew how to win.
- Exactly.

00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.403
- Is it over?
- It is over.

00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:02.239
Even if Ji-hu had gotten it wrong,
he would still win.

00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.699
It is not a prime.

00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:07.119
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu. That is correct.

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:09.371
You won two points.

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:10.914
KANG JI-HU: 8, JEON JI-MIN: 0

00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:19.423
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU WON THE ACE MATCH

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.759
He placed first in the pre-test
for a reason.

00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:23.093
Hands down.

00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:25.763
If it weren't for Ji-hu,

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.639
we wouldn't feel so nervous.

00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:30.058
Did they have to cast a genius like him?

00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.853
Let's do well in the main match.

00:54:33.479 --> 00:54:34.813
He's good.

00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:37.107
His strength seems to be
mental math and analysis.

00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:38.567
I'll remember him.

00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:40.527
You rock.

00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:42.112
Thanks for the great game.

00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:43.280
Did you memorize them all?

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:45.032
Well, not really.

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.034
The final results of Primality Test.

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:51.038
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu won the Ace Match.

00:54:52.331 --> 00:54:53.749
As the winner,

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:59.838
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu secured the benefit
for the upcoming main match.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.592
I'm so jealous.

00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.887
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.
Obviously, I'm happy for now.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.224
But knowing that some other team
has such a strong player...

00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:12.309
It's okay. Let's think of it
as a handicap for us.

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.770
A loss in the main match
practically means the Deathmatch.

00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:16.146
- The odds are two-thirds.
- Right.

00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:18.899
We'll need to stay alert.

00:55:19.233 --> 00:55:22.820
Both contestants,
please return to your base camps.

00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:24.988
Great work.

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.829
- Get over here.
- Come in already.

00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:33.413
Shower him with kisses.

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.752
You were amazing.

00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:41.463
- You were like a beast.
- Great work, man.

00:55:41.797 --> 00:55:45.300
- Well done. Thank you.
- Seriously though, you were incredible.

00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:46.343
You're the best.

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:48.470
We'd be writing history
if we lose with the benefit.

00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:50.848
- There's no way we'll lose.
- Of course.

00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.266
We have the benefit.

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:54.685
Having you on the team
counts as a benefit.

00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:55.644
That's also true.

00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:58.188
- We hold two benefits.
- On top of the one you won.

00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:00.941
- Bummer!
- Great job.

00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:02.776
You did great.

00:56:03.986 --> 00:56:04.862
It's a shame.

00:56:04.945 --> 00:56:06.780
Still, it's not like our team lost.

00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:08.198
Right, you did well.

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.117
All contestants,

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:15.998
please gather outside your base camps
for the main match.

00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:25.424
That Ji-hu rascal...

00:56:25.507 --> 00:56:26.800
I'll get you somehow.

00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:29.636
I was looking forward to the next game.

00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:32.764
My heart fluttered in excitement.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.850
Focus.

00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:37.060
Today's main match is

00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:41.106
Mine and Trade.

00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.567
What's this about?

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.277
Are we mining crypto?

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.945
That's right up our alley.

00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:49.197
- Does anyone invest in crypto?
- Mining?

00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:52.576
I dabble in short-term trading for fun.

00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:55.829
I purchase Doosan's stock
whenever Doosan Bears lose a match.

00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:58.290
Their price usually goes up afterwards.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.920
Mine and Trade comprises
of 10 rounds in total.

00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:06.089
You can either mine a coin
by solving calculation quizzes

00:57:06.173 --> 00:57:10.135
or invest in the crypto market
after investigating the price changes.

00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:14.306
The division with greater assets
will be declared the winner.

00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:19.436
The coins traded for Mine and Trade
come in eight different colors.

00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:21.563
While there is no limit
on the supply of the gold coins,

00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:26.234
the remaining seven varieties
come in 25 chips each.

00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:29.279
Before the game begins,

00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:34.785
discuss and divide your team
into 2 miners and 2 traders.

00:57:34.868 --> 00:57:40.540
The two miners will go to the Mining Room
and start mining the coins.

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:44.461
Please note
that they can only mine gold coins

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:46.797
and that there are two mining methods.

00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:48.173
First,

00:57:48.674 --> 00:57:51.802
they will be presented
with a set of 20 calculation questions.

00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:57.349
If they answer all 20 questions correctly,
they will be awarded one gold coin.

00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.518
Just like cryptocurrency mining.

00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:00.644
Second,

00:58:01.228 --> 00:58:02.980
they will be asked to multiply

00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:04.773
a 10-digit number
by another 10-digit number.

00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:09.528
If their answer is correct,
they will be awarded one gold coin.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.279
A 10-digit multiplication?

00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:13.532
The second method might be easier.

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:16.159
I prefer the 20-question set.

00:58:16.618 --> 00:58:18.996
At any point during the game,

00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:22.624
the miners can ask the traders
to be replaced.

00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:26.420
The 2 traders will be given 100,000 won

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:29.089
and two gold coins as their seed capital.

00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:33.927
In Round 1,
all coins will sell at 10,000 won.

00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:37.597
But as the game progresses,
their prices will fluctuate.

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.685
The sole exception is the gold coin.

00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.480
Its price will be fixed at 10,000 won
throughout the game,

00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:47.441
and it cannot be traded.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.695
The traders can visit the Inquiry Booth
set up in the Main Hall

00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:56.616
and submit queries to collect information
on the changing coin prices.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:01.371
When you visit the Inquiry Booth,
you can ask a single question.

00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:04.666
When you do so,
you must pay one gold coin.

00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:10.922
Your queries on the coin prices
must be a yes-no question

00:59:11.006 --> 00:59:14.051
with a limit of 40 Korean characters.

00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:16.178
How should we phrase our questions

00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:17.888
- within 40 characters?
- Please note

00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:20.307
that while you can phrase the question

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.768
to ask about the price of any coins
for any rounds,

00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:28.065
you cannot directly ask
the coin's price in a certain round.

00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:32.277
If you ask whether the red coin costs
more than a certain amount in Round 8,

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.987
they won't give you an answer.

00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:39.534
You can ask if the price of the pink coin
will increase at any point after Round 7.

00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:42.579
But you can't ask
if it will go up at Round 7.

00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:46.750
We're fine as long as we ask
about two or more coins, right?

00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.669
The teams may share
their queries and the answers

00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:51.922
with their allies in the same division.

00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:57.886
Any questions about the prices in Round 10
can only be asked during Round 9.

00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.639
The traders can buy or sell

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:05.519
seven coins except the gold coin
at the Exchange.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:11.817
You can only purchase
up to ten coins per visit.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:16.947
Each round lasts 25 minutes.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:19.699
After Round 3 and Round 7,

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.869
the total assets of each division
will be announced.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.747
The final winner of the game will be

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:29.334
the division with the greater total assets
after all 10 rounds.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:33.296
The bottom two teams
of the losing division

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.049
will face each other in the Deathmatch.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.593
We'll need to mine
as many gold coins as possible.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.428
The miners play a huge role.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.889
We're likely to win
if we mine a whole lot of coins.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.808
We also have to make investments.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:48.228
The issue is that we have no way
of knowing how high the prices can spike.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.398
- The prices are unrelated to our demands.
- That's right.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.692
The queries will play a huge role here.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.862
Do you think they'll give Team SKKU
extra funds as the benefit?

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:59.072
I'm afraid the benefit will be enormous.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.409
The benefit of this match
will now be revealed.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:08.540
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu,
the winner of today's Ace Match,

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.376
will receive two gold coins.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.628
Sweet.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.214
That's a huge bonus
to the whole Medical Division.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:19.217
The coins count as two queries,
so they can share that among themselves.

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.511
Yes, they can share their findings.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.514
These are actual solid coins.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:30.937
I wanted to use the benefit
and win the main match by a landslide.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.482
All teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:37.444
You'll be given 20 minutes.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.322
We only need to discuss trading, right?

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.073
There's room for discussion in mining.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.993
How long does it take for you to do
a 10-digit by 10-digit multiplication?

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.620
If you think about it...

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.624
Write down a one-digit number.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.833
Okay. How's seven?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.794
Let's be real.
Don't we need just 20 seconds?

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.380
Sounds about right.
It'd be more than enough.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.758
I was amazed at my teammates' speed.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.552
So 10 times 20 seconds.
Throw in extra time to add them all up...

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.721
Roughly, you can solve one
every five minutes.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.349
We can get five coins per round
if we really go all in.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.516
Yeah.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.894
Can we really mine a coin
every five minutes?

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:14.189
My teammates' expected turnaround time
was much shorter than I had thought.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.107
It lightened my heart.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:19.236
I'm so pumped right now.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:21.279
This is exciting.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:24.157
You know this isn't about buying
the coins whose value will increase

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.618
but buying the coin whose value
will increase the most, right?

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.078
- Sure.
- So hear me out.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.080
Let's use the binary search.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.958
ALGORITHM THAT NARROWS THE SEARCH
BY DIVIDING THE RANGE IN HALF

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:37.087
To find out which coin's value
increases the most...

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.964
Just three questions can tell us

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.466
- which coin will spike the most.
- How?

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.550
With the binary search.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.135
- Show it to me.
- For example,

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:48.431
we can ask if one of A, B, C, or D
will increase the most in Round 2.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:52.352
"Does this group of four coins have
the one whose price will rise the most?"

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.187
If the answer is yes,
we'll narrow it down further.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.481
IS THE TOP-GAINING COIN OF THE NEXT ROUND
AMONG BLACK, RED, BLUE, AND SILVER?

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:59.818
We can then ask if the coin whose value
increases the most in Round 2 is A or B.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.361
If the answer is yes...

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.739
THEN, THE TOP-GAINING COIN
IS EITHER BLACK OR RED

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:05.949
And this is next.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.994
We can't pinpoint a single coin,
so we'll ask about A and C.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.996
IS THE TOP-GAINING COIN OF THE NEXT ROUND
BETWEEN BLACK OR BLUE?

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.706
BLUE HAS ALREADY BEEN EXCLUDED

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.875
If the answer is yes, we go for A.
If not, we go for B.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.961
So, with three gold coins...

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:21.798
We can identify the top-gaining coin
within three queries.

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.883
Wait, Sang-yeon.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.012
What if another team purchases
all 25 coins of that color before us?

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.722
That's why I have a plan B.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.017
We'll use Plan Weighted Value.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:33.935
I'll give you an example.

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:36.563
Let's say we want to know
if the blue coin's price will go up.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.315
But we can't just ask about it.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.817
We won't get an answer
if we ask about one coin.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.902
"Will the sum of the blue coin's price

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.781
and the green coin's price times 0.00001
increase in the next round?"

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.576
Technically, we asked about two coins.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.703
It was a circumvention.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.122
The weighted value diminished
the influence of the green coin's price,

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:59.044
so the query would be virtually checking
the price of the blue coin only.

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:01.504
STRATEGY CHECKING ONE COIN'S INFORMATION

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:02.839
So you want to find out

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.425
the coin whose price will increase
the most in the next round

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.345
- and invest in that coin alone?
- Yes.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.138
Just to clarify,

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:13.433
would we then be asking
three questions per round?

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.642
Yes.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:17.979
To do that,
we'll need three gold coins per round.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.315
- The miners can get them.
- Wait, Sang-yeon.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:24.819
What if the returns
don't exceed 30,000 won?

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:28.948
Each query costs 10,000 won.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.701
If we leave the gold coin alone,
we can hold on to that 10,000 won.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:34.829
So we'd have to earn a profit
with the 10,000-won information.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.415
Suppose we learn about a 2,000-won margin
from the information.

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:40.502
- We need to buy five coins to break even.
- That's right.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:41.461
Here's an idea.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.339
The binary search
is the optimal approach, right?

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.925
There are three teams in a division.
Can't we ask a question each?

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:48.426
That's what I want to propose.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.054
THEY NEED 3 GOLD COINS
TO COMPLETE THE BINARY SEARCH

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:54.557
IF THE DIVISION WORKS TOGETHER,
EACH TEAM ONLY SPENDS 1 GOLD COIN

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:57.769
I think we should share the information
within the division.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:02.607
But complete transparency
might backfire on us.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:05.568
Let's say we used our gold coin
and obtained a piece of information.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:08.071
If we know a certain coin's price
is at its lowest, we should buy it.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:10.448
But there's a chance
others might beat us to the chase.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.617
The supply is limited.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.911
So we'll have to buy it
before sharing information.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:17.539
The fact that there are only 25 coins
makes it awkward.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:20.917
This prevents the teams
from buying ten coins each.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.546
If 2 teams buy 10 coins each,
the last team can only get 5 coins.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.548
It's an unfair setting.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:29.509
I initially considered suggesting
that each team spend a coin,

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.095
but I don't think
Team KAIST will cooperate.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.889
First off,
let's discuss information sharing.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.434
It's an absolute must.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:43.106
I can't think of a way to win
without cooperating with the other teams.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:47.026
If we're cooperating,
we'll have to get the other two involved.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.654
We win as long as our division
has more assets than Medical Division.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:50.905
Yes, exactly.

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:53.199
Defeating Medical Division is easier
than outranking the STEM guys.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.659
Right, much easier.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.953
Spoken like a true engineering major.

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:59.789
Others in our division
might come up with a killer strategy.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:03.543
So even if we have to suffer a small loss,
it won't hurt to work together.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.295
Even if we have to bear a small loss.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.255
As long as we're sure
our division can win,

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.339
let's go for that.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.924
If they still won't cooperate...

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:11.593
That's not my problem, then.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.470
We'll cooperate, right?

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:14.888
ALSO PLANNING ON WORKING TOGETHER

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.890
Let's just aim for the division's win.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.892
As for the Deathmatch,
we'll leave it to our fate.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.562
This is why we need to convince
Team KAIST and Team POSTECH to join us.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.063
I think we should see the division

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.984
as a single team
with a budget of 300,000 won.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.736
The other two teams might not agree,

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.362
- but that's the best plan.
- It's necessary.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.324
- We'd be idiots if we didn't.
- What if they don't agree?

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.202
We would be showing our cards
for no reason, then.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.705
Surely, they won't stab us in the back.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.167
Actually, we should consider
breaking the alliance later on.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.628
But we need to know
the division's total assets.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:50.089
- Wait, but we know how much we have.
- That's right.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:53.551
If our asset exceeds
one-third of the division's total assets,

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:55.220
- we can go solo.
- If there is a huge gap.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:57.680
- We should consider it.
- Yes, when it gets to that,

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:01.184
let's stay in the base camp
and focus on mining.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.354
I think cooperation
is a far better option.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:08.983
The whole division should work together
to find out the highest-earning coin.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.236
I want us to monopolize it

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:13.154
- to keep it away from the STEM teams.
- Agreed.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.073
Then, we can secure a lead early on.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.033
An early lead can make all the difference.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:20.703
We saw how difficult it was to catch up
in the Primality Test earlier.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:24.040
If we get a bigger fund early on,
we can prevent the opponents from earning.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.459
- That's right
- We need a big gap early on.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:31.089
We'll have to lead the division to victory

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:35.134
since that has an overwhelming advantage
for our team's success, statistically.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:38.221
You have five minutes left
to discuss your strategy.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.641
MINING ROOM
All teams, please decide on the two miners

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:44.602
INQUIRY BOOTH
and the two traders.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.271
Let's decide on the miners.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.648
- Don't forget the replacement timing.
- Here's what I think.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.025
Why don't you take charge
of the initial planning?

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.444
- Yeah, you should talk to--
- Right, I should.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:56.072
Then, Chung-seo and I
will handle the mining first.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.448
I'll take on mining.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:59.492
- I could probably last a while.
- You think so?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.369
I'm in good shape, too.
I'm not tired at all.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.121
Then, I'll go handle trading.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.456
TRADERS: HAN SEO-YEON, LEE SEUNG-HYEON
We'll be traders.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.292
Who wants to mine at the start?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.627
- I'll do it.
- All right, Ji-hu.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.671
Want me to join Ji-hu? Okay.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.548
We can switch at any moment anyway.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.174
MEDICAL DIVISION'S TRADERS
SNU: HAN SEO-YEON, LEE SEUNG-HYEON

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.051
YONSEI: PARK SANG-YEON, CHOI A-IN
SKKU: SUNG TAE-HUN, LEE DONG-JAE

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.720
MEDICAL DIVISION'S MINERS
SNU: KIM MIN-SEOK, JOO MIN-SEO

01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:20.471
YONSEI: LEE YUN-BEOM, LEE CHUNG-SEO
SKKU: KIM DONG-YEON, KANG JI-HU

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:23.600
As for mining,
Seok-hun should handle the 20 questions.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.685
It's because the 10-digit
by 10-digit multiplication

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.353
will take a while no matter who tries it.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:30.315
But an experienced player
would finish the 20-question sets quickly,

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:32.567
so I want you on the task, Seok-hun.

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:36.654
I believe I have an edge
on my teammates in calculation.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:37.864
I felt confident about my role.

01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:39.574
Can I try mining?

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:40.867
PARK SEO-YEON VOLUNTEERS

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.910
So you two will be our initial miners?

01:08:42.994 --> 01:08:43.870
- Yes.
- Great.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.080
Does anyone want to volunteer?

01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:47.540
I'll do the calculations.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.751
- I'll do the calculations, too.
- Okay.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.253
I should be out there
for the first three rounds.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.881
- For trading?
- So you want to be a trader?

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.216
I'm fine with either role.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.593
Join me, Ji-min.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.802
- As a trader?
- Yes.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.388
We need to build a strong alliance.

01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:03.806
STRONG LEADERSHIP REQUIRED

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.726
I chose to be a trader
because I thought I could contribute more

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.103
in persuading the other teams
and setting up the initial plans.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.564
STEM DIVISION'S TRADERS

POSTECH: HWANG SEOK-HUN, PARK SEO-YEON

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.572
The time for strategy meeting is up.

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:29.207
Since I placed first in the pre-test
and won the first Ace Match,

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.043
I wanted to keep the momentum going.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.339
Good luck, team.

01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:38.758
- Let's build an alliance and win.
- Let's do this.

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.678
I felt sure
we could take on Medical Division.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.099
If our division is leading after Round 3,

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.601
there's a high chance
STEM Division will go under on their own.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.770
Early breaks will matter a lot.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:53.940
To be honest,

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.776
even if an alliance doesn't work,
sharing the general plan wouldn't hurt.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.528
It's a division match, after all.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.030
At the end of the day,
our division has to win.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:07.078
The total assets are announced
after Round 7.

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:09.706
We could try breaking away
from the alliance after that.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:12.625
No way.
If we did, everything would go south.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.670
If you really want to try it,
we have to be sure we can win.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.718
I'll go grab one team
the moment the game begins.

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.011
You can hold on to the rest.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:32.395
All miners, please go to the Mining Room.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.063
- Good luck.
- We've got this.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.189
Holler if you get tired.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:36.649
- Good luck.
- Go get them.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.735
- Call for help if you get tired.
- Okay.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.822
- Good luck.
- We'll do our best.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:44.323
You've got this.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:48.786
MINING ROOM

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:49.787
Let's do this.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.289
- Good luck.
- Goodness.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:55.334
12 MINERS ALL SET AND IN POSITION

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.129
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:03.259
Today's main match, Mine and Trade,

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.011
will begin now.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.890
...will begin now.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.480
I've got incredible news. Come on, guys.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.107
So we're all in the same boat.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.067
- We've got to work together.
- Right.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.611
We're on the same page, aren't we?

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.029
You agree too, don't you?

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:26.324
Let's all gather in the same room,
from start to finish.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:27.575
Just like we're a team.

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.118
Honestly, I agree with you.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:33.080
Throwing the division match away
to focus on individual success is risky.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.250
Let's work together.
My teammate is talking to Team POSTECH.

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:37.960
He'll get them to join us.
So, the six of us--

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:39.378
We'd like to tell you our plan.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.131
- I can guarantee us profit at every turn.
- Guaranteed?

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:44.091
- Let's discuss it together.
- Okay.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.135
Team SNU's in agreement.

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:48.721
- Shall we work together?
- Okay.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.348
- Then...
- Whose base camp are we using?

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.725
- How about ours?
- Okay, it's in the middle.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.813
STEM DIVISION HEADS
TO TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:58.606
- I left it back there.
- Bring it here.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.108
First off, let's discuss things some more.
In Round 1...

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.110
...will begin now.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.445
MEDICAL DIVISION GATHERS IMMEDIATELY

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:07.990
Guys, how are you going
to phrase your questions?

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.743
I want us to use the binary search.
I even have all the questions.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.453
- Let's all use this plan.
- Okay.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:14.997
I'll underline the keywords
and hand each out to you.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.291
Building an alliance was a breeze

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.586
because all three teams
had prepared the same strategy.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:26.509
ALL 3 TEAMS IN MEDICAL DIVISION PREPARED
A STRATEGY USING THE BINARY SEARCH

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.971
We stormed over here
the moment they told us to begin.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.723
The fact that all three teams
came up with the same approach...

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.142
- That alone is crazy.
- For sure.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.270
Going into the game with a united front

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.105
- is the best plan.
- Exactly.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.900
Hey, Team SNU.
Can you tell us more about your plan?

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:44.902
Let's use the binary search
on the seven coins

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:46.070
to break them into two groups.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.488
We'll ask about this group first...

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.824
- We thought of that, too.
- I knew it.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.451
The difference between the prices
of the next round and this round

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.370
can be negative for all coins.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.956
In a round where all coin prices crash,

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:01.043
you end up with a loss even if you buy
the coin with the minimal drop in price.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:04.964
To prevent this, we could try asking

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.967
if the maximum value of subtracting
this round's price from next round's price

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.343
is bigger than zero.

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:11.345
In other words,
we can ask this at the start.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.389
"Is the whole market plunging
in the next round?"

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.725
- You want to clear that first?
- If the answer is no,

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.476
we can then begin the binary search.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.605
If we share the burden
and ask a question each,

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.690
- we only need to spend 10,000 won each.
- Right.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.817
Since there's a cap on the purchases,

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.194
working together guarantees us
a bigger return.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.696
Let's go all in!

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:35.202
Miners, you may begin.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.538
12 MINERS GET TO WORK

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.873
GOLD COIN MINING TYPE A

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.003
Oh, shoot. What the heck?

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:51.928
I thought I could make good progress
because the 20 questions weren't tricky.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:53.554
GOLD COIN MINING TYPE B

01:13:58.935 --> 01:13:59.852
What the hell?

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:03.773
I lost my composure
because the sheer length

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.984
of the 10-digit by 10-digit multiplication
was astounding.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.965
All right, then. Let's get in line.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:30.508
I'll go first.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.593
MEDICAL DIVISION ASKS QUESTIONS RIGHT AWAY

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.346
I'll submit a gold coin.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:38.432
1 QUERY COSTS 1 GOLD COIN

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.353
IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE COIN IN ROUND 2
THAT COSTS MORE THAN 10,000 WON

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:45.648
AMONG GREEN, BLUE, AND PURPLE COINS?

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.320
ANSWER: NO

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.157
THE MOST EXPENSIVE COIN IN ROUND 2 IS
ONE OF BLACK, PINK, SILVER, OR RED COINS

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.118
I'll narrow it down to black and pink

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:58.953
- That's it.
- and submit the query.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:05.042
IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE COIN IN ROUND 2
THAT COSTS MORE THAN 10,000 WON

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.127
BETWEEN BLACK AND PINK COINS?

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.670
Do we find the second most expensive?

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:08.963
It's either black or pink.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.090
The most expensive coin
is either black or pink.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.802
IS BLACK COIN MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN PINK COIN IN ROUND 2?

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:23.477
- What did you get?
- This is what I asked, and I got a no.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.479
If black coin doesn't cost
more than pink coin...

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.734
THE MOST EXPENSIVE COIN IN ROUND 2
IDENTIFIED AFTER 3 QUESTIONS

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.194
- It's pink.
- What's the answer?

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.154
- What did you get?
- Pink?

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:34.780
Black coin doesn't cost
more than pink coin.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.658
So pink coin has the highest price.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:39.660
We decided to take turns.

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:40.661
Oh, okay.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:43.164
ONE TEAM BUYS 9 COINS
WHILE THE OTHERS BUY 8

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.082
MAIN MATCH
MINE AND TRADE

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.126
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.085
Hello.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:51.505
YOU CAN BUY UP TO 10 COINS
OF ANY COLOR AT THE EXCHANGE

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:55.134
Please tell me the color and the quantity
of the coins you want.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.844
I'd like eight pink coins.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.512
Eight pink coins, please.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:01.015
I'd like nine pink coins.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:03.434
MEDICAL DIVISION BUYS ALL 25 PINK COINS

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:07.646
5 MINUTES INTO MINING

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:15.196
KIM DONG-GEON TYPES IN THE ANSWER
OF THE 10-DIGIT BY 10-DIGIT MULTIPLICATION

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.411
COIN MINING FAILED

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.705
I didn't think it would take so long.

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:29.877
But I ended up making a mistake
while adding up the results.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.883
COIN MINING FAILED

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:46.268
KANG JI-HU SOLVED 19 OUT OF 20 QUESTIONS

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:53.400
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:54.985
That was quick.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:17:00.199
MINED GOLD COINS ARE SENT TO BASE CAMPS

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:02.493
Here's our coin.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.788
- A gold coin.
- What was that?

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.331
Team SNU mined a gold coin.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:09.333
- Team SNU in Medicine, to be exact.
- Yes.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.502
How do they work so fast?

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.838
TEAM SNU'S JOO MIN-SEO
MINED THE FIRST GOLD COIN

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:17.174
JOO MIN-SEO'S PROBLEM

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.010
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.096
SUCCEEDED WITHOUT AN ERROR

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:29.436
I was caught off guard by her quick pace.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.107
Working with the 10-digit numbers
was a complex process,

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:36.694
so I tried my best
not to make a mistake along the way.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.072
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.740
KANG JI-HU SUCCESSFULLY MINED A COIN NEXT

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:45.744
Team SKKU succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.164
As expected from Ji-hu and Dong-yeon.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.415
Thank you, guys.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.419
I was amazed at their speed.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.879
I had to focus on getting the answer.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:57.464
I needed to solve it
to contribute to my team.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.217
- Let's stay calm.
- Right.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.178
We've got this.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:05.472
There we go.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:06.432
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:08.559
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.227
STEM DIVISION'S MINERS PICK UP THE PACE

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:14.315
Team POSTECH succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:19.445
Team SNU in STEM succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.531
- It's 2-to-2 now, right?
- Yes, you got it right.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:25.284
Come on, Team KAIST.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:32.249
I just realized something.
We have a few gold coins to spare.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:34.793
So why don't we make more purchases now?

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.086
We can afford more queries,

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:37.922
so you want us to submit them
for the next rounds?

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.633
Right, asking questions early on
to stock the coins would help.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.844
Coins of each color
were limited to 25 copies.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:46.555
So if STEM Division purchased
all 25 coins ahead of us,

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:51.727
there would be none left for us to buy.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:56.148
I wanted us to collect information quickly
and buy the promising coins first.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.359
Shall we go in
and sort out our strategies?

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:00.194
Yes, let's sit down and strategize.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.323
Frankly, it's so reassuring
to have such competent allies.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.493
I still can't believe
that we all devised the same strategy.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:09.286
Great.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.748
Once we miss our shot
at buying the most expensive coin,

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:14.959
there's almost no way
any of us can place first.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.418
We must...

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:17.670
How should I phrase it?

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.797
We must maintain a lead at all times.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.467
Right, we have to stay one step
ahead of STEM Division.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:26.095
Let's just get on with the questions.

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:29.598
How do we phrase it?
"Price gain from Round 2 to Round 3"?

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:30.516
That's right.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:34.561
Team Yonsei succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:35.854
LEE CHUNG-SEO'S SUCCESS

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.147
Go for it, Team Yonsei!

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:43.988
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:45.322
Let's go, Medical Division.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.365
- All right.
- Let's go.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.616
We've got this.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.410
Team SKKU...

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:54.081
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.625
COIN COUNT
MEDICAL DIVISION: 6, STEM DIVISION: 2

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:57.876
That's enough.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.712
- They're mining far too many.
- I'm amazed.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.965
If this keeps up, we're bound to lose.
We're at a huge disadvantage.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.425
That's true.

01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:08.304
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in five minutes.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:13.976
Round 2's price subtracted
from Round 3's price...

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:17.313
Wait, how about we invest 10,000 won
to ask if there's a round

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:21.317
- where all coin prices drop?
- You mean, all of them?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.152
Since the game was created with a design,

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.529
I thought there would be
at least one round

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:27.072
where all prices would drop.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.491
So I wanted to check my concern.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.581
SEND

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:39.251
IS THERE A ROUND WHERE ALL PRICES DROP
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ROUND?

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.510
IS THERE A ROUND WHERE ALL PRICES DROP
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ROUND?

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:53.265
That's crazy.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.060
The answer is yes.

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:57.978
- There's going to be a crash.
- Really?

01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:00.272
- We dodged a bullet.
- Wait, really.

01:21:00.647 --> 01:21:04.568
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in one minute.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.571
- Hear that? We need to get in line.
- Okay, line up.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.198
Let's do what we did earlier.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.491
TRYING TO FIND COINS TO BUY IN ROUND 3

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:13.827
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in 30 seconds.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:20.250
IS THE COIN WITH THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 2 TO ROUND 3

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.169
AMONG BLACK, PINK, SILVER, AND RED COINS?

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:25.756
It said yes. Our target is
among black, pink, silver, and red coins.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.178
"...price gain from Round 2 to Round 3
between black and pink?"

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:34.264
IS THE COIN WITH THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 2 TO 3 BETWEEN BLACK AND PINK?

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:39.686
DOES BLACK COIN HAVE A BIGGER PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 2 TO ROUND 3 THAN PINK COIN?

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:42.231
- What did it say?
- Black's gain is bigger than pink's.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.192
That's because pink coin
is the most expensive in Round 2.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:48.612
So we should sell all pink coins
and buy all black coins next.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:52.366
That concludes Round 1 of Mine and Trade.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.619
- That's a wrap.
- Finish that one and go.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:56.870
No, I can keep on mining.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:57.788
- Can I go, then?
- Yes.

01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.289
- Okay.
- That feels right.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:02.209
- This seems to be a good fit for me.
- Really?

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:03.836
Good for you.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:07.381
COIN MINING FAILED

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:10.676
- Shall we swap?
- Let's do that.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.178
20 QUESTIONS: KANG JI-HU,
10-DIGIT X 10-DIGIT: KIM DONG-YEON

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:16.014
KIM DONG-YEON AND KANG JI-HU SWITCH TYPES

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:18.851
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.978
TEAM POSTECH'S PARK SEO-YEON
MINED HER SECOND GOLD COIN

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.939
Wait, I can't leave just yet.
I must send a request.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.985
TEAM YONSEI'S LEE YUN-BEOM
MINED HIS SECOND GOLD COIN

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:30.279
TEAM YONSEI'S POSITION CHANGE REQUEST

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:34.366
Team POSTECH's miner
requested a change of position.

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:38.370
Team Yonsei's miner
requested a change of position.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.538
You have to go now.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.416
Pass this note to the others.
I don't have the time to talk to them

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:44.501
- because I need to get going.
- Got it.

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:47.129
TEAM POSTECH'S LEE JUN-U JOINS THE MINERS

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.633
TEAM YONSEI'S PARK SANG-YEON
JOINS THE MINERS

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:55.721
Coin prices in Round 2
will now be revealed.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.184
Black coin costs 12,000 won.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:02.686
Red coin costs 13,000 won.

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:04.897
Blue coin costs 8,000 won.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.899
Silver coin costs 9,000 won.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.775
Green coin costs 11,000 won.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:09.693
Pink coin...

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:13.614
MEDICAL DIVISION OWNS ALL 25 PINK COINS

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.824
Pink coin costs 13,000 won.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.202
Purple coin costs 12,000 won.

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:22.414
PINK COIN'S PRICE INCREASED
FROM 10,000 WON TO 13,000 WON

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:25.959
Round 2 of Mine and Trade begins now.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:29.463
Wait, black coin costs 12,000 won now.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:33.050
MEDICAL DIVISION PLANS TO BUY BLACK COINS
WHICH IS THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE NOW

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:34.927
If black coin gets
the biggest gain in Round 3,

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.387
isn't it likely
that all prices drop in Round 3?

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:40.182
- In the next round--
- How else can it get the biggest gain?

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:42.434
Since black coin
has already increased the most

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.937
and would yield
the biggest gain this time,

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:50.484
even if all the coins were to drop,
I thought black coin would fall the least.

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:51.860
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 2

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:55.155
Shall I ask about Round 3
to remove the uncertainties?

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.658
We can ask if the price gain
from Round 2 to Round 3...

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.326
- If it exceeds zero?
- Yes, shall we?

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:01.578
Let's do that before the binary search.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:05.249
"...exceed zero?"

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:09.503
"Does the black coin's price gain
from Round 2 to Round 3 exceed zero?"

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:13.048
DOES THE BLACK COIN'S PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 2 TO ROUND 3 EXCEED ZERO?

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:18.554
UNACCEPTABLE QUERY

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.557
LEE SEUNG-HYEON WASTED 1 COIN BY MISTAKE

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:23.308
I phrased it wrong.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:25.143
I phrased it wrong.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.940
I only asked about black coin
when that's not allowed.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:34.861
It's not allowed because the answer
could confirm its price in Round 3.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:37.781
I should've included
green coins in my query.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.412
I made the error
while rushing to submit the query.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:46.832
I felt terrible for my mistake.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:50.335
- How would you update your query?
- We know black coin has the biggest gain.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:54.256
"Does black or green coin's price gain
from Round 2 to Round 3 exceed zero?"

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.758
This query obeys the rules
because it asks about two coins.

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.678
If the answer is yes, we know
black coin is the most expensive one

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.680
- because it already costs more.
- Yes, that's it.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:02.681
What if the answer is no?

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.600
- Then, both are below zero.
- Are they?

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.143
- We shouldn't trade.
- Right, you're good.

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:08.895
We know black coin's price gain
is the biggest, so that should do it.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:12.566
They already established
that black coin's price in Round 2

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:15.611
subtracted from its price in Round 3
is bigger than any other coins.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:19.072
That's why they can be sure of the results
even if the query mentions another coin.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:22.868
If the answer is yes, at least
the black coin's price will go up.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.370
If the answer is no,
the prices of all coins will go down

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.205
including that of the black coin.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.707
In other words, it's a bear market.

01:25:33.003 --> 01:25:34.087
Suppose the answer is yes.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:37.215
Black coin's gain is the bigger one,
so at least that's a positive number.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:39.259
If the answer is no, both are negative.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.181
What did you get?

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:45.474
- It said yes.
- The price goes up?

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.644
That means either black or green coins
or both increased in price...

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.604
BLACK COIN'S PRICE WILL GO UP IN ROUND 3

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:52.898
We can discuss more over there.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.358
MEDICAL DIVISION WANTS TO BUY BLACK COINS

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:55.692
I want to check the black coins.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:57.361
The first to go in--

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.488
They can check the stock
and buy one-third of it.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.198
- That's it.
- Then, the next person follows.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.992
CHOI A-IN HEADS TO THE EXCHANGE
TO BUY BLACK COINS

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.078
I can't even guess
STEM Division's strategy.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:09.122
I have no idea what they're doing.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.089
I'd like to check
the stock of black coins.

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.425
None remains.

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.803
None remains.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.894
So black coins got wiped out.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:13.979
