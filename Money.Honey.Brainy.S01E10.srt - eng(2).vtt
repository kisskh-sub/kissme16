00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.320
The Operations Department

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.280
Has the new host proposal been sent over?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960
Is Qixing in it?

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.320
It absolutely cannot be her.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.240
Of course.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.280
And also,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.479
if Qixing tries to pry information from you,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.039
you must not tell her

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.599
about the relationship between me and Xin Tong.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:05.439
President.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.200
President!

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.799
Xin Tong!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.760
Why are you so reckless?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Why didn't you knock?

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.159
Coffee should be brewed like this.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.959
Do you understand?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.359
Don't make me teach you a second time.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.640
Why didn't you knock?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.599
Why didn't you knock?

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.159
I'm in a hurry!

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.480
I'm really sorry.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.439
Um,

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.879
about the new host proposal...

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:26.480
I've seen it.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.400
That's exactly what I came to talk about.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.159
Our company

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.879
is about to launch a new live room, right?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.879
The synonym for the live room is

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:33.480
"vitality".

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.680
Plus "independent woman".

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.640
I think

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640
based on these points,

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.519
Qixing

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.719
is the most suitable.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
But why was Qixing rejected?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.159
Rejecting her...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
I think Qixing

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.519
is completely

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.159
unsuitable.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.959
What do you know?

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.400
Has Xin Tong lost her mind?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.519
From what I understand,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.400
Qixing comes from a very privileged background.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.480
But all these years,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.519
she has never relied on her family's resources.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.879
Through step-by-step effort,

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.040
she became today's top streamer.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.120
You can't simply label her

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.879
as just a streamer or an internet celebrity.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.280
I think

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.280
Qixing is the most representative

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.599
modern woman.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.240
I've said it before.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.919
Qixing is not suitable.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.560
Let's consider

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
other host candidates.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:23.800
Fine.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:26.240
Let me ask you.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.199
I...

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.599
Yes.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.520
I'm asking you.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.759
Genuine,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.560
independent,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.000
highly approachable,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.800
and also very cute.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.960
Are there many streamers like that?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.599
Popular for years,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.360
no scandals,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.199
no negative reviews.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.000
Are there many streamers like that?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.039
Live-stream sales

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.879
consistently rank in the top ten.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.599
Are there many streamers like that?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.599
No, not many.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.400
But...

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.439
No "buts".

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.000
The answer is obvious.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.840
Qixing

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960
is absolutely the best candidate

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.439
for our Sihai Vitality Live Room.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.479
Xin Tong's suggestion is debatable.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.840
Don't you think?

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.919
All of these

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.240
are just a persona.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:11.240
Right.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.800
Do you really know her?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.000
Of course I know her!

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.520
Boss...

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.919
Enough!

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.360
I think...

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.960
Has the secretary also gone crazy lately?

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't care what you think.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.919
I care what I think.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.360
Within three days,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.759
present a new host proposal.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.719
That's it.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.680
Meeting adjourned.

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.319
Xin Tong.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080
Don't be angry.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.919
Xin Tong also has the company's best interests at heart.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.800
Oulu.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.280
Speak.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.520
Sorry,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:55.560
I was engrossed.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.120
Qixing said she wants to see me.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.599
Can you go check on her for me?

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.199
What trick is she trying to pull now?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.800
The president's secretary has been getting a bit too cocky lately.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.319
But you're even more so.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.319
I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.040
You...

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.519
are just stubborn.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.680
There are plenty of streamers who want to sign with us right now.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.720
Why are you so fixated on Qixing?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.399
Yeah.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:24.759
I'm begging you,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.399
let Qixing go, and let me go too.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.120
Okay?

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.439
Right now, I only have one thought.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.279
It's to tie that Galileo

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.680
to a Roman column and burn him alive.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.920
Let me show you a clear path.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.879
You

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.160
should jump ship and go work for Qixing.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.040
And besides,

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.839
it was Bruno who was burned at the stake.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:47.959
Calm down.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.360
This Galileo

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.000
Has such poor taste.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.639
I refuse to believe it.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.120
Rico

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.720
Can't handle it.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.120
I know why

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.040
The President rejected your proposal.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:08.959
Why?

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.399
I'll tell you a secret.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.879
You must swear to me on staying single forever

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.319
That you'll never tell a third person.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.800
I swear to you on eight lifetimes of being single,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.680
I will absolutely not tell a third person.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.879
What is it?

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.079
Qixing

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.639
Is Galileo's

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.240
Twin sister.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.839
Darn it.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.800
But those two don't look alike at all.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.000
Twins can be identical or fraternal, right?

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.240
You have a point.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.720
Then, if that's the case,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.439
Siblings working together

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.680
Should be smoother, shouldn't it?

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.600
The world of the rich

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.800
Is a deep sea.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.000
Originally,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.680
Family businesses pass to sons, not daughters.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.439
But the younger sister, Qixing,

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.600
Through her own efforts,

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.079
Carved out her own territory.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.399
Making the Chairman

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.800
Look at her in a new light.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.759
I understand.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.839
You mean to say

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.360
These two siblings

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.199
Are competing for the Four Seas inheritance.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.439
The more that's the case,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.439
The more we can't let that darn bastard succeed.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.199
With his limited vision and ability,

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.519
How can he compare to Qixing?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.759
I will help the Princess Heir ascend the throne.

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.759
Stella,

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.360
How do you know so much?

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.399
Because

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.920
The old President

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.879
Is my great-uncle.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.000
It really is a family business.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.759
Hello, Qixing.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.600
Sorry to bother you.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.079
I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:53.720
This

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.000
Is a gift I prepared for you.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.079
Do you want an autograph?

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.959
That's right,

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.920
but

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.120
I want you to sign this.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:02.319
Hello.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.279
Let me introduce myself.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.720
I'm Xin Tong, an Operations Specialist at Four Seas Group.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.199
Four Seas?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.160
I'm being very presumptuous by coming here,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.480
But I wanted to invite you

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.959
To be a guest on our Four Seas food live stream.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.920
I don't know

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.000
What your thoughts are.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.319
You must be acting on your own initiative, right?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.439
Why would Four Seas invite me as a guest?

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:22.800
To be honest with you,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.600
This proposal

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.480
Was indeed drafted on my own initiative.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.759
You can take a look first.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.319
If you are inclined to agree,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480
Then I can try to persuade the company.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:32.480
No need.

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:34.199
Thank you for your kindness.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.560
I don't want to go to Four Seas

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.439
As a guest.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.680
I understand.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.639
I, as

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.199
A 0.01 percent

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.360
Minor shareholder of Four Seas,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.800
Would like to express to you

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.000
That between you

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.600
And the current President,

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.759
I have more faith in you.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.519
I hope even more

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.720
That you can become

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.480
The future helmsman of our Four Seas.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.720
Well, seeing how sincere you are,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.079
I'll take a look at the contract first.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.879
Okay.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.480
Take a look.

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:09.319
Wen Pei'an?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.720
Why is he on Qixing's phone?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.399
And it's an intimate photo of the two of them.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.560
Qixing

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.720
Was once rumored to be in a relationship.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.399
The other person's identity was shrouded in mystery.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.399
Could that person

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:25.920
Be Wen Pei'an?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.000
Wen Pei'an dumped Qixing,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.439
And Qixing can't get over him.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.399
This

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.720
Is the opening.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.600
The proposal is well-written,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.840
But I'm sorry.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.639
I'm not considering going to Four Seas right now.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:48.399
That's okay.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.879
I'd like to ask presumptuously,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.399
What is your relationship with the person on your phone wallpaper?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.399
What?

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.000
You

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.720
Don't know about our relationship?

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.960
Ex-boyfriend.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.120
We broke up.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.720
Haven't changed the wallpaper yet.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.559
That means

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.600
You still have feelings for him.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.559
In that case,

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.120
I think

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.519
I can try to help you repair

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.679
The relationship between you two.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.000
If you need it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.440
Then what's your relationship with him?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.559
I'm his

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.759
Business partner.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.679
Are you confident you can do that?

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.480
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.679
I believe no boy

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:32.240
Could refuse

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.080
A girl as outstanding as you.

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:39.200
Sign.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.840
Sorry, sorry.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:48.799
Thank you.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.799
Pleasure doing business.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.120
Pleasure doing business.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.440
I'm also one of Xing's Stars.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.159
What kind of cooperation?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.320
Ga

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:02.559
Boss

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.440
What were you guys just talking about?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.600
I didn't catch it.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:09.039
That bastard must have predicted my prediction.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.480
He deliberately beat me to it.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.000
Trying to sabotage our cooperation.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.159
As for me,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.279
I represent all of Xing's Stars

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.600
to check on Qixing's

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:19.559
boss.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.639
Why are you here too?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.000
The President's affairs

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.600
are none of your business.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.919
If there's nothing else,

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:25.840
please leave now.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.360
Fine.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.399
Then I won't keep you siblings from catching up.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.840
Okay.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.120
Successfully fired

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.000
Qixing's first shot to take over Four Seas.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:35.320
Goodbye, Boss.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.879
This Xin Tong,

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.960
is the one you told me about before, right?

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.720
Wen Pei'an's fake girlfriend.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.799
Yeah.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.799
I didn't expect

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:46.559
her to be so persistent.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:47.919
Dad said

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.919
as long as Wen Pei'an is in a relationship,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.639
then

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.840
he can take over Four Seas.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.240
So he found Xin Tong

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.360
to be his girlfriend.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:55.240
But

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.080
what's unexpected is

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.000
Xin Tong now works at Four Seas.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.360
And she's always believed

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.440
that I am the President

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.240
and your brother

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.279
is the assistant.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:03.639
So,

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.480
is that clear enough for you?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.840
I understood, but also kind of didn't.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.600
I just think

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.799
they actually seem quite well-matched.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.039
So,

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.440
are you really coming

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.279
as a guest?

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.600
Not only am I going as a guest,

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.879
I'm also going to have her repair

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.720
the relationship between me and Wen Pei'an.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:26.639
What do you mean?

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.919
She thinks I'm Wen Pei'an's ex-girlfriend.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:31.000
No way.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.080
What?

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.279
Are you angry?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.600
The situation is already chaotic enough.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.960
And you want to add fuel to the fire?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.960
Don't be mad.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.399
Why so fierce?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.679
It's been so long since you've seen me.

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:48.080
Kiss me.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.080
My brother still doesn't know about our relationship, right?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.960
Right now, in his eyes,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.480
there's only his company and himself.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.320
And Xin Tong.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:01.360
I'm like

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.879
invisible, like air.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:03.759
I'm really looking forward

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:05.759
to his reaction when he finds out we're together.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.519
No.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.720
I'm not looking forward to it.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.360
If he finds out,

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:10.720
he'll definitely go crazy.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.919
"Even an 'ugly' husband has to meet his brother-in-law."

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:17.840
Let the storm

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.120
rage even more fiercely.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.159
Go, go!
