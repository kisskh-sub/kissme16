00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.880
President Wen

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.280
The thing you requested has been delivered.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.000
I need an explanation.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.799
I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.280
went out to use the restroom.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.719
Then I ran into an acquaintance.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.880
Talk about a coincidence, right?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.759
Alright.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.320
It's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.479
Qian Kexin's family

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.240
set her up on another blind date.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.400
Haven't you noticed?

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920
This whole area is crawling with love surveillance agents.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.200
Where?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.799
What would you two like to eat?

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.159
Just a couple of vegetable dishes is fine.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.879
Then I'll order a few things for you.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.920
Sure, sure, sure.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.319
I'm really sorry.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.079
It was a momentary lapse on my part.

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:30.400
How do we handle this?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.040
It's all fake anyway.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.799
Right?

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:34.599
And you?

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.480
Don't care.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.359
He doesn't care either.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.079
What will outsiders think of me?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.040
What do you mean?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.400
With my charm,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:42.480
my woman

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.879
would never date another man behind my back.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.560
That's the point you're concerned about?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.480
Fine, fine, fine.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.159
You're the client.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.920
You call the shots.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.799
I'm starting to wonder if

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.560
Hou Yi missed shooting down one sun,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.040
making you shine so brilliantly now.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.560
You're very close to losing control like this.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.599
I, Wen Pei'an,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.840
never do anything outside my control.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.519
Okay.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.640
One minute.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.840
Give me one minute, I'll handle it.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.439
Excuse me.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.080
Who is that?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.479
Him?

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.680
He's my

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.680
best guy friend.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.400
You know?

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.240
So, meeting you for the first time,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.280
he gets a bit nervous.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.840
You could think of it as social phobia.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.879
That's why he seems

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.280
a little tense.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.400
He does seem quite tense.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.680
Let me tell you a secret.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.159
He just went through a bad breakup.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.560
It was really tragic.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.879
So he follows me everywhere.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.360
I'm just worried he might do something rash.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.520
So, Senior, how about today we just pretend

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.199
It's fine.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.680
I understand completely.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.400
It's just an extra set of chopsticks, right?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.759
Darn it.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.000
The other man is approaching the young master.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.280
That's not what I meant.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.159
Chairman.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.599
Should we go help?

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:57.280
No.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.520
This sort of thing,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.520
let him handle it himself.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.719
Understood.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.960
Xin Tong told me about your relationship.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.479
You know already?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.639
I know.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.800
I'm very sorry

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.000
for interrupting your date.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.520
If you don't mind,

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.080
we could have dinner together.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.400
I think

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.240
that won't be necessary.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.560
Sure.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.680
As expected of the young master.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.120
His composure is impressive.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.360
He's actually sitting

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.439
harmoniously with the other man.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.800
Lin Xiang.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.400
Xin Tong and I are former schoolmates.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.599
How should I address you?

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.319
A Wen.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.280
You can call him A Wen.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.639
A Wen.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:41.319
Here.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.439
Sweetheart,

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.840
your favorite little cake.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.919
The young master is asserting his dominance over the other man.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.439
This is so delicious.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.120
Actually, I really envy you.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.360
It's just that...

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.240
You don't have to care about worldly opinions.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.319
You can live life according to your own ideas.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.840
Xin Tong has told you quite a bit.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.560
Just a little.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.400
Right.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.240
She just mentioned it in passing.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.160
I still have to rely on acting skills.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.759
To get by.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.720
I also face a lot of...

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.639
Pressure from my parents.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.160
Right?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.600
We're the same kind of people.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.120
No, no, no.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:35.720
This...

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.319
Is also not quite the same.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.519
Yes.

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:38.839
Not quite the same.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:39.439
This...

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.160
You might have a slight misunderstanding.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.199
I'm actually quite traditional.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.360
But...

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.639
But that doesn't prevent me...

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.680
From accepting the world's...

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.759
Diversity.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.439
Maybe we should eat first.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.600
I'm getting a little hungry.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.079
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.120
Let's eat.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.279
The food's getting cold.

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.600
Quick.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:55.920
Hurry up.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.639
Eat, eat.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.800
Such a harmonious relationship between three people...

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.199
This is the first time I've seen it.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.879
They're actually getting along peacefully.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.079
That's a bit strange.

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.800
Should I...

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.439
Arrange something?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.160
You.

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.279
Go notify Ou Lu.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.120
Tell him to come see me.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:13.000
Yes.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.079
I'm very happy tonight.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.000
To have dinner with you two, my family.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.759
Family.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.839
One family.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.399
Family.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.839
A Wen.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.720
Let bygones be bygones.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.519
With Xin Tong by your side...

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.160
I believe you'll soon find...

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.199
Your former happiness.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.600
I'd be lucky if she doesn't cause trouble for me.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:37.680
Xin Tong.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.879
Will we still have a chance to meet up?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.040
Of course, Senior.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.240
Let's meet anytime.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.839
I hope you soon find...

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:46.800
Someone more worthy.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.879
Bye.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.759
Your senior...

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.560
Really is a strange person.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.199
Check, please, you two.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.600
How much is it?

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.959
Eighteen thousand.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.439
How...

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.000
...much?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.120
Eighteen thousand.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.360
We...

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.839
...only ordered two vegetable dishes.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.279
Spanish peas.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.240
German white asparagus.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.160
Japanese matsutake mushrooms.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.920
French potatoes.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600
Let me reiterate.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.639
During our cooperation period,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.560
you are not allowed to take on similar side jobs.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.319
My plan

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.519
could be ruined.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.600
The contract

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.199
only says I can't date.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600
But with the little money you're paying,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.879
it's not enough to buy all my time.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.480
Do you love money that much?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.079
Wrong.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.720
I don't love money.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:43.240
Money gives me a sense of security.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:44.920
To achieve

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.720
my Grand Retirement-at-Thirty-Six Plan sooner,

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.800
I plan

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.519
to trade ten years of hard labor

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.439
for a lifetime of enjoying the world.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.079
Why thirty-six?

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.079
Because in the internet industry,

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.600
thirty-five is the legal retirement age.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.839
Which country's law are you talking about?

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.399
Algorithm.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.279
So lame.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.800
I hope you won't, for money

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.560
and a strange goal, have no bottom line in cooperation.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.560
Then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.920
Someone like me...

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.560
...for money,

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.480
has a very low bottom line.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.160
How low?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.480
Paper-thin.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.199
You're blocking the rearview mirror.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.120
All arrangements for today

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.800
are

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:40.160
at the cafe.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.759
Right.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.959
I thought you've been too tired lately,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.279
so today,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.839
I gathered all the clients

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:46.480
and scheduled them together

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.319
to improve efficiency.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:50.519
Not bad.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.120
You're teachable.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.040
Alright.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:07:59.800
Ou Lu,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.720
what do you think of Wen Pei'an's girlfriend?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.560
How is she?

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:05.160
She's...

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.000
...quite good.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:07.319
No.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.879
I think this girl

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.519
is too playful.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.879
I hope

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.800
to have Wen Pei'an

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.399
meet some other girls.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.319
Chairman, if there's anything you need me to do,

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.160
just give the order.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.560
You won't betray me, will you?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.319
Absolutely not.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.800
Facing the Chairman, one cannot be disloyal.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.199
Facing a brother, one cannot be dishonorable.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.439
Since ancient times, loyalty and righteousness are hard to balance.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.879
So I can only arrange blind dates under the guise of business.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.759
Dad.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.399
We are truly in love.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.519
Why don't you believe it?

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.320
It's your eyes

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.440
that gave you away.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.879
In your eyes,

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.799
I don't see

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.799
the love that endures

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.279
through thick and thin.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.799
Dad,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.440
you and mother have been

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.759
a marriage in name only for twenty years.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.960
You simply don't understand what love is.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.039
Now,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.639
you're forcing me into a marriage alliance with someone else,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.000
to repeat your life.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.240
I won't accept it.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.879
If you don't listen to me,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.519
starting now,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:02.039
I'll confiscate all your assets

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.159
and sever

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.320
our father-son relationship.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.679
Starting tomorrow,

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.200
I will become an orphan.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.519
I'll chop wood,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.799
feed the horses.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.840
We'll travel the world together.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.120
From then on, we'll care about grain and vegetable prices.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.919
We might not afford a house,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.879
but we can face the sea,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.879
with spring warmth

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:23.559
and roses blooming.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.080
Thank you, Uncle, for raising me.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.120
Thank you, Uncle.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.919
Let's go.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.600
Ungrateful son!
