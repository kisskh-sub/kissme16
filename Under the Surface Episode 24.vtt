00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.680
Zhiqiu.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.360
Mr. Xiang,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.500
let me take you somewhere.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.840
Where?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.920
You'll see when we get there.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.160
Child.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.680
Your father

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
is taking me to turn myself in.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.880
Xiangyang,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.360
I've disappointed you again in the end.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.520
I'll turn myself in.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.640
But why

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.160
can't you give me six more months

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.080
to have this baby?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520
Back to this place again.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.000
That email,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.320
did you see it?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.880
What email?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.120
Actually,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.040
I'm not Ye Zhiqiu.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.860
I've known for a long time.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560
I thought

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.840
I could fool you.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.560
I just preferred to let myself be deceived.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.360
Long ago,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.170
I already sensed it.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.160
You're not the one

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.290
who was hot and cold with me, Ye Zhiqiu.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.370
I don't know who you are.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.120
I don't know why

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.640
you're pretending to be Ye Zhiqiu to get close to me

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.240
or what your real purpose is.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.700
But since you appeared in my life,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.620
I've felt a sense of security I've never had before.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.930
I'm becoming more and more addicted to this feeling.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.839
I don't want to know who you are anymore.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.959
Let's just say you're Ye Zhiqiu.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.540
Then do you know

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.580
where the real Ye Zhiqiu is right now?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.600
I don't want to know anymore.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.760
No.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.320
You must know.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.200
Do you know

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760
how Rachel died?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.320
How Shelly died?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.760
And Shi Xiaodi?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.400
It doesn't matter if you didn't see that email.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.720
I can tell you myself.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.800
I don't want to hear anymore.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.460
They're all

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.720
with Ye Zhiqiu now,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.920
lying in a dark, sunless underground place.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.720
Please stop talking about this.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.720
Their deaths have nothing to do with you.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.850
How can they have nothing to do with me?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.160
Ye Zhiqiu's death was an accident,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.120
but everything that happened afterward spiraled out of control.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.160
I am the unforgivable criminal.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.880
Is that so?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.720
I know

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.880
all these people were killed by Leng Xiaoxiao.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.240
From the first time I saw the surveillance footage,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.760
I already knew there was someone

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.690
who looked exactly like Ye Zhiqiu.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.450
I just never thought

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600
that person would be Leng Xiaoxiao.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.440
I should have talked Xiaoxiao out of it.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.570
I shouldn't have

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.370
let Xiaoxiao make one mistake after another.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.880
If I had been a little braver,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.120
if I had turned myself in earlier,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.520
if I had ended all this sooner,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.159
perhaps

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.180
Xiaoxiao and the others wouldn't have died.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.730
But, Xiangyang,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.760
I'm pregnant.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.320
The doctor says

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.680
he's developing well.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.560
He's already formed.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.730
Could you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.040
give me another six months?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.650
Let me give birth to him.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.280
Then I'll turn myself in.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.600
Okay?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.560
I know.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.690
I thought I was someone who knew right from wrong.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.600
But until I met you,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.360
until I fell in love with you,

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.760
I abandoned all my previous moral principles.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.040
Even though you were once my friend's wife,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.090
I still selfishly want to have you for myself.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.380
I blame myself for Hong Ming's death,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.560
yet I'm hopelessly lost in your tenderness.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.600
I can ignore all the gossip in the world.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.000
I just want to be with you.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.600
Xie Yuxuan,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.960
can we give each other a chance?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.960
But I can't do it.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.960
I can't

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.840
put all the blame

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.600
on Xiaoxiao.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.100
Xiangyang,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.520
I want to end all this.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.180
I want to atone for my sins.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.930
I want to turn myself in.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.240
But our child...

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.730
Then let's have the baby first.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.340
No matter what happens in the future,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.330
I will always stay by your side.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.280
Now we'll start counting down.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.690
You will slowly wake up.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.200
You know that everything that just happened

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.159
was just a dream.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.130
You want to wake up from this dream.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.480
Your body is slowly regaining consciousness.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
Your hand moved.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.120
Everything in the hypnotic trance

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.720
hasn't happened yet.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.480
You can choose your life path again.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.240
Now,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.500
you're about to wake up

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.900
and return to the present.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.250
What did you see?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.280
I saw...

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.260
I spread rumors about how Xiangyang hurt me.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.920
My father, to protect me,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.480
endlessly insulted Xiangyang.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.260
The relationship between the Leng family and Xiangyang got worse and worse.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.480
Dad finally had a heart attack from anger and passed away.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.520
I fell into a pit of hatred.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.760
I dragged my best friend into endless revenge.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.840
In the end, I lost everything

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.560
and became what I hated most.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.480
Do you really have to do this?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.960
Is there a better choice?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.720
Xiaoxiao.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.440
Sis,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.090
why didn't you go back home?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.280
My mom was in a car accident two weeks ago.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.940
She had surgery that same day.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.800
She's still recovering now.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.240
It happened that afternoon after leaving your place.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.040
By the way,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.610
what are you doing here?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.340
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.680
I came to get some medication

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.010
and have hypnotherapy.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.440
Hypnotherapy?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.080
It's like

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.090
I've been in a dream.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.160
And now I've woken up.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.500
Only then did I realize

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.880
how to live a better life.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.600
Sis.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.320
Buy some good food for Mom

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.780
and get the best medicine.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.600
Don't tell Xiangyang I was here.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.520
Why not?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.240
We're going through a divorce.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.640
Divorce?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.600
Is it because of me and Mom?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.440
No, Xiaoxiao, let me tell you.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.040
Xiangyang is a filial child.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.040
He knows Mom had an accident

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.360
at the entrance of your neighborhood,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.960
and he feels extremely guilty about it.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.720
That's why he's being temperamental.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.520
Don't divorce him because of this.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.120
Sis.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.450
I'm at fault too.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.280
I've never

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.040
considered things from Xiangyang's perspective.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.500
I've never cared about his feelings either.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.690
I'm leaving.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.480
Take good care of Mom.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.800
Xiaoxiao.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.160
Honey.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.100
What are you doing?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.840
Weren't you on a business trip?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.170
Why are you back so soon?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.280
Because I missed you.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.360
It's broad daylight, aren't you in a hurry?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.890
Hurry up.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.600
I made plans with Xiaoxiao to see Zhiqiu's concert.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.160
How can I rush something like this?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
If I rush, how could you enjoy it?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.080
Honey.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.360
Hurry up.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.560
We're going to be late.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.440
Coming.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.050
How do I look in this outfit?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.480
Beautiful.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.240
My wife

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.160
looks gorgeous in anything.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.210
You're such a sweet talker.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.090
Let's go.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.520
Rachel.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.240
I wouldn't be who I am today without you.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.200
I'm looking forward

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.530
to stepping into the next decade with you.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.320
I hope

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.560
you'll always be my comrade through thick and thin,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.720
my closest friend.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.160
Thank you.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.240
Thank you for being here.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.970
At the same time,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.330
I'd also like to thank my dear classmates.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.920
Thank you all for coming today

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.560
to witness my next decade.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.120
Thank you all.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.560
I love you all.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.620
Why didn't Xiangyang come today?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.680
He's busy.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.180
Hongming didn't come either.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.530
That's true.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.640
I'm sorry.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.120
Am I late?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.400
Is it all over?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.760
You two talk. I'll go find Hongming.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.320
Bye.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.560
I thought you

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.280
didn't want to see your first love,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.160
Ye Zhiqiu.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.770
What are you talking about?

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.690
You're the only one in my heart.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.200
This is a gift I brought you from Europe.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.720
You'll definitely like it.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.580
You shouldn't have spent so much.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.900
Come over here.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
Limited edition.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.480
Good taste.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.280
Xiaoxiao.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.360
I'm sorry.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.640
During my trip to Europe,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.570
I met with David.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.090
He's very interested in our products.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.600
If we can convince Dad

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.120
to make some minor adjustments

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.580
to our existing products,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.820
David will definitely agree.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.840
I understand.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.040
Dad never listened to your suggestions before.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.700
From now on,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.860
I'll be the mediator between you two.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.040
Xiaoxiao.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.970
Thank you for your help.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.890
You've worked hard too.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.010
Let's go eat.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.090
Let's go.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.280
Mom, are you okay?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.040
I'm fine.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.760
Take some time to rest when you get home.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.040
Make sure to remind Mom to take her medicine on time.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.240
Don't worry. I can take good care of Mom.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.960
Xiaoxiao came to the hospital a while ago.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.690
Did you know?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.060
She didn't tell me.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.420
She didn't mention it.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.040
Mom.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.200
Xiaoxiao.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.080
I'm here to take you home from the hospital.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.560
Good.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.200
What's wrong?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.180
I cut my finger.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.360
It's nothing.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.140
You're still smiling?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.609
Does it hurt?

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.040
I'm fine.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200
Press on it first.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.839
How can you be so happy when you're hurt?

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.080
Seeing you so serious

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.380
is really amusing.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.970
You're making lamb with scallions for me?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.640
Why didn't you ask my sister to help you?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.080
I wanted to surprise you.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.120
I don't want to bother your sister for everything.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.000
I don't want your mother to think

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.360
that I can't do anything.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.220
She might feel sorry for you then.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.130
But you've never

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.290
set foot in a kitchen your entire life.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.400
All this time,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.840
you've been the one making sacrifices for me.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.840
But love should be a two-way street.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.120
Xiaoxiao.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.760
I love you.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.040
I love you too.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:24.480
